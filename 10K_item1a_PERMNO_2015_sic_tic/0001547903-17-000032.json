Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all of the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" on page 3 of this report. Our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, including any such statements made in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business Generally\nWe began writing mortgage insurance policies in April 2013, and prior to that, we did not engage in any substantive insurance operations. Therefore, we do not have a long operating history on which investors may rely for purposes of projecting our future operating results.\nPrior to writing our first mortgage insurance policies in April 2013, we did not engage in any substantive operations and, therefore, do not have a long operating history on which investors may rely for purposes of projecting future operating results. Having a short insurance operating history, we are subject to substantial business and financial risks and could suffer significant losses, all of which are difficult to predict. We continue to develop business relationships, enhance our technology platform, gain customers, establish operating procedures, continue to hire staff and complete other tasks appropriate for the conduct of our intended business activities. Our long-term success will also be dependent upon our ability to continue to execute the operating procedures we have established and to continue to develop the internal controls to effectively support our business and our regulatory and reporting requirements. Further, industry conditions may change in a manner that adversely affects the development or profitability of our business, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to develop our business in a timely manner, if at all.\nIf we are unable to continue to attract and retain the most significant mortgage originators as customers, our ability to achieve our business goals could be negatively impacted.\nThe success of our mortgage insurance business is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain as customers the most significant mortgage lenders in the U.S., as determined by volume of their own originations as well as volume of insured business they may acquire from other lenders through their correspondent channels. We believe these mortgage lenders are critical to the achievement of our business goals because of their dominant market share. As a result of their size and market share, these entities originate a significant majority of low down payment mortgages in the U.S. and, therefore, influence the size of the MI market. We are currently doing business with a majority of these lenders. However, there is no assurance we will receive approvals from each of the remaining lenders to transact MI business with them. If we are unable to maintain our approved status with one or more of these mortgage lenders, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted. Even if these lenders become our customers, we cannot be certain that any loss of business from one would be replaced from other new or existing lender customers. Such lenders may decide to write business only with certain mortgage insurers based on their views with respect to an insurer's pricing, underwriting guidelines, servicing and loss mitigation practices, financial strength or other factors. Our customers may choose to diversify the mortgage insurers with which they do business, which could negatively affect our level of NIW and our market share. In addition, our Master Policy does not, and by law cannot, require our customers to do business with us. In 2016, premiums earned from one significant customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenues. The loss of business from significant customers, if not offset by additional business from other customers, could have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write, and consequently, our financial condition and operating results.\nAs a participant in the mortgage lending and MI industries, we rely on e-commerce and other technologies to conduct business with our customers. If we do not maintain connectivity or otherwise meet the technological demands of our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide and distribute our products and services. Customers require us to provide and service our MI products in a secure manner, either electronically via our internet website or through direct electronic data transmissions. Accordingly, we invest resources in establishing and maintaining electronic connectivity with customers and, more generally, in e-commerce and technological advancements. Our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted if we do not successfully establish and maintain these arrangements or otherwise keep pace with the technological demands of customers.\nIf we, together with third parties with whom we have contracted, are unable to develop, enhance and maintain our technology platform with respect to the products and services we offer, our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed.\nWe have developed a proprietary enterprise technology platform designed to support our operations. If our technology platform fails to perform in the manner we expect, our business, financial condition and operating results will be significantly harmed. Further, our business would be negatively impacted if we are unable to timely and effectively enhance our platform when necessary to support our primary business functions. There is no assurance that we will not experience significant difficulties with the operation of our technology platform. The success of our business is dependent on our ability to resolve any issues identified with our technology platform during operations and to make timely improvements. Further, we will need to match or exceed the technological capabilities of our competitors over time. We cannot predict with certainty the cost of such maintenance and improvements, but failure to make such improvements and any significant shortfall in any technology enhancements or negative variance in the time-line in which system enhancements are delivered could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we have contracted with a number of third parties in connection with the development and operation of the platform, and we rely on these third parties to competently perform their obligations in a timely manner. Any failure to maintain acceptable arrangements with these third parties, or the failure of any of these third parties to perform and/or deliver in an acceptable and timely manner combined with our inability to find acceptable replacement arrangements, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur Master Policy contains restrictions on our ability to rescind coverage for certain material misrepresentations (including fraud) and underwriting defects, and if we were to fail to timely discover any such misrepresentations or underwriting defects, our rights of rescission would be significantly limited, and we could suffer increased losses as a result of paying claims on loans with unacceptable risk profiles.\nUnder our Master Policy's rescission relief provisions, we agree that we will not rescind or cancel coverage of an insured loan for material borrower misrepresentation or underwriting defects after a borrower timely makes a certain number of payments (either 12 or 36), as specified in our Master Policy. In addition, once the borrower has made such number of full and timely consecutive monthly payments, we have agreed to limitations on our ability to initiate an investigation of fraud or misrepresentation by our insureds or any First Party involved in the origination of an insured loan. Twelve-month rescission relief on an insured loan is subject to our successful completion of an independent validation on such loan. If we are unable to perform an independent validation on an insured loan, such loan will qualify for rescission relief after a borrower timely makes 36 consecutive monthly payments. The current processes we have in place to review insured loans may be ineffective in detecting material misrepresentations and/or underwriting defects prior to a borrower making the requisite number of payments. After a loan meets the conditions for rescission relief, we are contractually prohibited from exercising our rights of rescission for borrower misrepresentation (including fraud) and certain First Party misrepresentations; our rights to investigate potential First Party fraud or misrepresentation are significantly curtailed; and we may be obligated to pay claims on certain loans with unacceptable risk profiles or which failed to meet our underwriting guidelines at the time of origination. As a result, we could suffer unexpected losses, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are outsourcing the underwriting of our mortgage insurance on certain loans to third-party underwriting service providers. If these USPs fail to adequately perform their underwriting services or place our coverage on loans we would deem ineligible, we could experience increased losses on loans underwritten by them and our customer relationships could be negatively impacted.\nIf our USPs fail to adequately perform their underwriting services, such as mishandling of customer inquiries or an inability to underwrite a sufficient volume of applications per day, we may lose opportunities to place mortgage insurance coverage on particular loans, our reputation may suffer and customers may choose not to do business with us. In addition, if our USPs place our MI coverage on loans that are ineligible for coverage under our underwriting guidelines, our risk of loss will be increased on those loans or the premiums we charge will be inadequate given the risk presented. We do not have the right under our Master Policy to cancel coverage of an ineligible loan as a result of a USP making an incorrect decision. Further, other than being able to terminate our contracts with these USPs, we generally do not have express loan-level monetary contractual remedies against these USPs if we are obligated to pay claims on ineligible loans that they improperly agreed to insure on our behalf. If these USPs fail to adequately perform their underwriting services or consistently place coverage on ineligible loans, we could experience increased losses on loans underwritten by them and our customer relationships could be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThere can be no assurance that the GSEs will continue to treat us as an Approved Insurer in the future, and our failure to maintain compliance with the GSEs' PMIERs could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nNMIC is a GSE Approved Insurer, and the significant majority of insurance we write is on loans sold to the GSEs. (Italicized terms have the same meaning that such terms have in the PMIERs, the GSE's eligibility requirements.) As a result, our compliance with the PMIERs is necessary to maintain NMIC's status as an Approved Insurer. The PMIERs establish operational, business, remedial and financial requirements applicable to Approved Insurers. By April 15th of each year, NMIC must certify it met all PMIERs requirements as of December 31st of the prior year. NMIC also has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of its failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements. As of December 31, 2016, NMIC had sufficient assets to meet the PMIERs financial requirements, and we expect to certify to the GSEs by April 15, 2017 that NMIC fully complied with the PMIERs as of December 31, 2016.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that NMIC will continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements. For the reasons discussed in these Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Report, NMIC's future results could be negatively impacted, causing a reduction to revenues, an increase in losses, or requiring the use of assets, which could cause its available assets to fall below the amount required under the PMIERs financial requirements. In addition, as NMIC continues to grow its business and increase its net RIF, it is anticipated that NMIC's total risk-based required asset amount will increase more rapidly than its available assets and that NMIC will need to raise additional capital or reduce its net RIF, including through the use of additional reinsurance, in order to remain in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements and to continue to support new business writings. We expect to continue to seek reinsurance as the primary means of reducing our net RIF to support our future NIW growth. Any future growth capital may be in the form of debt, equity, or a combination of both. We can give no assurance that our efforts to raise capital, obtain additional reinsurance or otherwise reduce our RIF would be successful. If we are unable to raise additional capital, obtain additional reinsurance or enter into alternative arrangements to reduce our RIF, NMIC may not meet the PMIERs financial requirements.\nIn addition, there is no assurance the GSEs will not make the PMIERs financial requirements more onerous in the future. In particular, the PMIERs provide that the table of factors that determine minimum required assets will be updated every two years or more frequently to reflect macroeconomic conditions, loan performance or to address other issues the GSEs deem important. If we are required under the PMIERs to increase the amount of available assets in order to support our business writings, the amount of capital our insurance subsidiaries are required to hold will increase, which may have a negative effect on our returns. Any such effect could have a negative impact on our flexibility to meet our business plans and our future operating results. In addition, the GSEs may amend the PMIERs at any time.\nCompliance with PMIERs requires us to seek the GSEs' prior approval before taking many actions, including implementing new products or services, entering into reinsurance arrangements and inter-company agreements or paying dividends, among others. PMIERs' prior approval requirements could prohibit, materially modify or delay us in our intended course of action. Further, the GSEs may modify or change their interpretation of terms they require us to include in our mortgage insurance policies for loans purchased by them, requiring us to modify our terms of coverage or operational procedures in order to remain an Approved Insurer, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results. Although not as likely, the GSEs could, in their own discretion, require additional limitations and/or conditions on certain of our activities and practices that are not currently in the PMIERs in order for us to remain an Approved Insurer. Additional requirements or conditions imposed by the GSEs could limit our operating flexibility and the areas in which we may write new business.\nIf, in the future, NMIC fails to comply with the PMIERs, including the financial requirements, it may lose its Approved Insurer status from one or both GSEs, or may have to enter into a remediation plan (with the approval of the GSEs), curtail its business writings or cease transacting new business altogether. Any of these events would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and future business prospects.\nNMIC is subject to state insurance department capital adequacy requirements, which if breached, could result in NMIC being required to cease writing new business in such states.\nNMIC's principal regulator is the Wisconsin OCI. Under applicable Wisconsin law, as well as that of 15 other states, a mortgage insurer must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its RIF in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. While formulations of minimum capital may vary in each jurisdiction that has such a requirement, the most common measure applied allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 25:1. Wisconsin and certain other states, including California and Illinois, apply a substantially similar requirement referred to as minimum policyholders' position. If our business grows faster (i.e., our RIF grows faster than expected) or is less profitable than expected (i.e., our revenues do not generate the return we expect), our actual RTC ratios over the short to mid-term could exceed our expected RTC ratios and could begin to approach the limits to which we are subject, which could require us to enter into alternative arrangements to reduce our RIF, including through additional reinsurance, or raise additional capital. We can give no assurance that our efforts to obtain additional reinsurance or otherwise reduce\nour RIF, or to raise capital would be successful. If we are unable to obtain additional reinsurance or enter into alternative arrangements to reduce our RIF or raise additional capital, we may exceed these state-imposed capital requirements. Accordingly, if we fail to meet the capital adequacy requirements in one or more states, we could be required to suspend writing business in some or all of the states in which we do business.\nWe are exposed to certain risks associated with our 2016 QSR Transaction, including the possibility that our reinsurers will fail to perform their obligations or that we will lose the capital credit we expected to receive when we entered into the 2016 QSR Transaction as a result of future GSE or Wisconsin OCI action or if any of our reinsurers experiences a downgrade or other adverse business event.\nIn September 2016, in order to continue to grow our business and manage insurance risk and our PMIERs required assets, we entered into the 2016 QSR Transaction. There is a risk that the 2016 QSR Transaction will not continue to provide the benefits we expected when we entered into it, including as a result of our counter-parties not performing their obligations, the GSEs or the Wisconsin OCI not continuing to give us full capital credit as anticipated for the duration of the contract, or if one or more reinsurers experiences a downgrade or other adverse business event. Any of these events could have negative impacts on the credit for the risk transferred under the reinsurance agreement and, in turn, on our capital needs, PMIERs position and growth potential.\nReinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our insureds to pay claims, even when there are reinsurance recoverables available to us under the 2016 QSR Transaction. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. To mitigate this risk, there are certain contractual protections that afford sources from which we may directly secure our reinsurance recoverables. See Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6, Reinsurance,\" below. To the extent these sources are insufficient to cover loss recoveries and other amounts to which we are entitled under the 2016 QSR Transaction, we would attempt to recover such amounts directly from the reinsurers. There is a risk that one or more reinsurers would be unable or unwilling to pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf a reinsurer experiences a ratings downgrade, the 2016 QSR Transaction agreement obligates such reinsurer, consistent with PMIERs requirements, to increase collateral in the trust account. If the reinsurer breaches its collateral obligations, and fails to cure after notice, we may terminate the agreement with respect to such reinsurer. The 2016 QSR Transaction also gives us the right to terminate the agreement in other cases, including, among other reasons, if a reinsurer becomes insolvent, has its license revoked or reinsures its entire liability under the 2016 QSR Transaction with another entity. If we experience an early termination, we would be required to re-assume the risk ceded to the breaching reinsurer and lose the PMIERs and statutory capital credit we had expected to receive when we entered into the agreement with respect to such reassumed risk. Depending on the timing and severity, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, growth potential and future capital needs.\nIn addition, the GSEs and the Wisconsin OCI have the right periodically to review performance under the 2016 QSR Transaction, including the reinsurers\u2019 financial strength and other factors the GSEs and Wisconsin OCI believe are important to an evaluation of the transaction, which factors may be unknown to us. As a result of such reviews, the GSEs or the Wisconsin OCI could withdraw their approvals or continue their approvals, but grant less than full capital credit. If we do not continue to receive full capital credit in connection with the 2016 QSR Transaction, we would likely need to seek other sources of capital or reductions in RIF sooner than we would have expected with full capital credit under PMIERs. Future sources of capital will depend on the cost, availability and terms and conditions that are acceptable to us, our regulators and the GSEs. We cannot be sure that we will be able to secure other sources of capital or substitute reductions in RIF in the amounts we require and on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe face intense competition for business in our industry from existing private MI providers and potentially from new entrants. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may not be able to achieve our business goals and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe MI industry is highly competitive. With six private MI companies actively competing for business from the same residential mortgage originators, it is important that we continue to differentiate ourselves from the other MI companies, each of which sells substantially similar products as ours. We compete with other private MIs based on our financial strength, terms of coverage, underwriting guidelines, customer service (including speed of MI underwriting and decision making), ancillary products and services (including training and, on a limited basis, loan review services), information security, product features, pricing, operating efficiencies, customer relationships, name recognition, reputation, the strength of management teams and field organizations, ability to generate management and customer reports based on comprehensiveness of databases covering insured loans, effective use of technology and innovation in the delivery and servicing of insurance products and ability to execute. Certain of our competitors are subsidiaries of larger corporations that may have access to greater amounts of capital and financial resources than we do at a lower cost of capital (including, as a result of tax-advantaged, off-shore reinsurance vehicles) and some have better financial strength ratings than we have. As a result, they may be better positioned to compete in the traditional MI market, as well as outside of traditional\nmortgage insurance, including if the GSEs were to pursue alternative forms of credit enhancement other than traditional mortgage insurance.\nOur financial strength ratings may remain important for our customers to maintain confidence in our products and our competitive position. A downgrade in NMIC's ratings, or the potential for a downgrade, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including (i) increased scrutiny of our financial condition by our customers, resulting in potential reduction in our NIW or (ii) negative impacts to our ability to conduct business in the non-GSE mortgage market, where financial strength ratings may be more important for such lenders. In addition, although financial strength ratings are not a consideration of remaining an Approved Insurer under the current PMIERs framework, they may play a greater role to the extent GSEs consider utilizing forms of credit enhancement other than traditional MI, including utilization of deeper MI coverage or other forms of credit risk transfer.\nOne or more of our competitors may seek to capture increased market share from government-supported insurance programs, such as the FHA, or from other MI companies by reducing pricing, offering alternative coverage and product options, including offerings for loans not intended to be sold to the GSEs, loosening their underwriting guidelines or relaxing risk management policies, which could, in turn, improve their competitive positions in the industry and negatively impact our ability to achieve our business goals. Competition within the MI industry could result in our loss of customers, lower premiums, riskier credit guidelines and other changes that could lower our revenues or increase our expenses. If our information technology systems are inferior to our competitors', existing and potential customers may choose our competitors' products over ours. If we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors and attract and retain our target customers, our revenue may be adversely impacted , which could adversely impact our growth and profitability.\nIn addition, we and most of our competitors, either directly or indirectly, offer certain ancillary services to mortgage lenders with which they also conduct MI business, including loan review, training and other services. For various reasons, including those related to resources or compliance, we may choose not to offer these services at all or not to offer them in a form that is similar to the prevailing offerings of our competitors. If we choose not to offer these services, or if we were to offer ancillary services that are not well-received by the market and fail to perform as anticipated, we could be at a competitive disadvantage which could adversely impact our profitability.\nOur underwriting and risk management policies and practices may not anticipate all risks and/or the magnitude of potential for loss as the result of unforeseen risks.\nWe have established underwriting, credit and risk management policies and practices that seek to mitigate our exposure to borrower default risk in our insured loan portfolio by anticipating future risks and the magnitude of those risks. Our underwriting and risk management guidelines are based on what we believe to be the major factors that impact mortgage credit risk. Those factors include, among others, the borrower's credit strength, the loan product, origination practices of lenders, the percentage coverage and size of insured loans and the condition of the economy. In addition, there are certain types of loan characteristics relating to the individual loan or borrower that affect the risk potential for a loan, including its LTV, purpose and terms and the credit profile of the borrower. The presence of multiple higher-risk characteristics in a loan materially increases the likelihood of a default on such a loan unless, and to the extent, there are other characteristics to mitigate the risk.\nThe frequency and severity of claims we incur will be uncertain and will depend largely on general economic conditions, including the unemployment rate and trends in home prices. To the extent that a risk is unforeseen or is underestimated in terms of magnitude of loss, our underwriting and risk management policies and practices may not completely insulate us from the effects of those risks. If these policies and practices do not correctly anticipate risk or the potential for loss, we may underwrite business for which we have not charged premium commensurate with the risk or we may establish loss reserves at levels that do not accurately approximate our actual ultimate loss payments. Either one of these could result in materially adverse effects on our results.\nWe expect our claims to increase as our portfolio grows and matures.\nWe believe, based upon our experience and industry data, that claims incidence for mortgage insurance is generally highest in the third through sixth years after loan origination. Historically, the first two to three years after loans are originated are a period of relatively low claims, with claims increasing substantially for several years subsequent and then declining. Factors, such as persistency of the book, the condition of the economy, including unemployment and housing prices, and others, can affect this pattern. We began writing mortgage insurance coverage in 2013. Although our claims experience to date has been as expected, we anticipate incurred losses and claims to increase as our earlier book years reach their anticipated period of highest claim frequency and as we begin to layer on additional book years of coverage.\nThe actual default rate and the average loss per default that we experience as our portfolio matures is difficult to predict and is dependent on the specific characteristics of our current in-force book, as well as the profile of business we write in the future. Our default experience and claims incurred are generally affected by:\n\u2022\nthe state of the economy, including unemployment, which affects the likelihood that borrowers may default on their loans;\n\u2022\ndeclines in housing values, as such declines may negatively affect loss mitigation opportunities on loans in default, as well as increase the likelihood that borrowers will default when the value of the home is below or perceived to be below the mortgage balance;\n\u2022\nthe product mix of IIF, with loans having higher risk characteristics generally resulting in higher defaults and claims;\n\u2022\nthe size of loans insured, with higher average loan amounts tending to increase claims incurred;\n\u2022\nthe LTV ratios of our insured loans, with higher average LTV ratios tending to increase claims incurred;\n\u2022\nthe percentage of coverage on insured loans, with higher percentages of insurance coverage tending to result in higher incurred claim amounts than lower percentages of insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nhigher DTI ratios, which tend to increase incurred claims; and\n\u2022\nthe distribution of claims over the life of a book, as described above.\nIncurred losses and claims may exceed our expectations in the event of general economic weakness or decreases in housing values. An increase in the number or size of claims, compared to what we anticipate, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditions.\nOur IIF may be concentrated in specific geographic regions and could make our business highly susceptible to downturns in local economies, which could be detrimental to our financial condition.\nWe seek to diversify our insured loan portfolio geographically; however, the availability of business might lead to concentrations in specific regions in the U.S., which could make our business more susceptible to economic downturns in these regions. Our IIF and RIF is currently more heavily concentrated in California than other states, primarily as a result of the location and timing of acquisition of new customers. A deterioration in local or national economic conditions in the mortgage market and other economic conditions, including home prices, levels of unemployment and interest rates or an increase in default rates in specific geographic areas or generally could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nActual premiums and investment earnings may not be sufficient to cover claim payments and our operating costs.\nWe set premiums at the time a policy is issued based on our expectations regarding likely performance over the term of the policy. Our premium rates are developed based on expectations that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Our premiums are subject to approval by state insurance regulators, which can delay or limit our ability to increase our premiums. Generally, we will not be able to cancel the MI coverage or adjust renewal premiums during the life of an MI policy to mitigate adverse development. As a result, higher than anticipated claims generally will not be able to be offset by premium increases on policies in force or mitigated by our non-renewal or cancellation of insurance coverage. While we believe our initial capital, premiums and investment earnings will provide a pool of resources sufficient to cover expected loss payments and have made estimates regarding loss payments and potential claims, the ultimate number and magnitude of claims we experience cannot be predicted with certainty and the actual premiums and investment earnings may not be sufficient to cover losses and/or our operating costs. An increase in the number or size of claims, compared to what we anticipate, could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. We may not be able to achieve the results that we expect, and there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed our total resources.\nAdverse investment performance may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of highly-rated debt obligations. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. Changes in interest rates and other market conditions, as well as credit events for particular issuers, could materially impact the future valuation of securities in our investment portfolio, which may cause us to impair, in the future, some portion of those securities. These impairments could adversely impact our liquidity, financial condition and operating results. In times of financial stress, the markets for some securities can become illiquid, which would impair our ability to sell our securities for cash.\nIncome from our investment portfolio provides a source of revenue and cash flow to support our operations and claim payments. If we improperly structure our investments to meet those future liabilities or have unexpected losses, including losses resulting from the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity, we may be unable to meet those obligations. NMIC's investments and investment policies are subject to state insurance laws, which results in our portfolio being predominantly limited\nto highly rated fixed income securities. To date, our investment portfolio has been established at a time of historically low interest rates. If interest rates rise above the rates on our fixed income securities, the market value of our investment portfolio would decrease. Any significant decrease in the value of our investment portfolio would adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe may be required or find it advisable to change our investments or investment policies depending upon regulatory, economic and market conditions, or our existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements, including the tax position, of our business. Our investment objectives may not be achieved. Although our portfolio consists mostly of highly-rated investments and complies with applicable regulatory requirements, the success of our investment activity is affected by general economic conditions, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and, consequently, the value of fixed income securities.\nWe establish loss reserves when we are notified that a loan we insure is in default for at least 60 days, based on management's estimate of claim rates and claim sizes, which are subject to uncertainties and are based on assumptions about certain estimation parameters that may be volatile. As a result, the actual claim payments we make may materially exceed the amount of our corresponding loss reserves.\nOur practice, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) for the MI industry, is to establish loss reserves only for loans that servicers have reported to us as being at least 60 days in default. We also establish IBNR reserves for estimated losses incurred on loans that have been in default for at least 60 days that have not yet been reported to us by the servicers.\nThe establishment of loss and IBNR reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. We establish loss reserves using our best estimates of claim rates, i.e., the percent of loan defaults that ultimately result in claim payments, and claim amounts, i.e., the dollar amounts required to settle claims, to estimate the ultimate losses on loans reported to us as being at least 60 days in default as of the end of each reporting period. We estimate IBNR by analyzing historical lags in default reporting to determine a specific number of IBNR claims in each reporting period. Our estimates of claim rates and claim sizes are strongly influenced by prevailing economic conditions, for example current rates or trends in unemployment, housing price appreciation and/or interest rates, and our best judgments as to the future values or trends of these macroeconomic factors. Many of these factors are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Further, our expectations regarding future claims may change significantly over time. If prevailing economic conditions deteriorate suddenly and/or unexpectedly, our estimates of loss reserves could be materially understated, which may adversely impact our financial condition and operating results. Due to the inherent uncertainty and significant judgment involved in the numerous assumptions required in order to estimate our losses, our loss estimates may vary widely. Because loss and IBNR reserves are based on such estimates and judgments, there can be no assurance that even in a stable economic environment, actual claims paid by us will not be substantially different than our loss and IBNR reserves for such claims. Our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely impacted if, and to the extent, our actual losses are greater than our loss and IBNR reserves.\nFurther, consistent with industry practice, our reserving method does not take account of losses that could occur from insured loans that are not in default. Thus, future potential losses that may develop from loans not currently in default are not reflected in our financial statements, except in the case where we are required to establish a premium deficiency reserve. As a result, future losses on loans that are not currently in default may have a material impact on future results if, and when, such losses emerge.\nWe may be required to establish a premium deficiency reserve if the net present value of our premiums and reserves is less than the net present value of our loss payments and expenses.\nIn addition to establishing loss reserves for loans in default, under GAAP, we are required to establish a premium deficiency reserve for our mortgage insurance products if the amount by which the net present value of expected future losses for a particular product and the expenses for such product exceeds the net present value of expected future premiums and existing reserves for such product. We evaluate whether a premium deficiency exists at the end of each fiscal quarter. Our evaluation of premium deficiency is based on our best estimates of future losses, expenses and premiums. This evaluation depends upon many significant assumptions, including assumptions regarding future macroeconomic conditions, and therefore, is inherently uncertain and may prove to be inaccurate. There can be no assurance that premium deficiency reserves will not be required in future periods. In addition, even if we were required to establish a premium deficiency reserve, there can be no assurance that it will be adequate.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our efforts to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our success depends in large part on the relationships, services and skills of our management team and our ability to motivate, develop and retain these individuals and other key personnel, which includes members of our Finance, Sales,\nLaw, Risk, Insurance Operations and IT departments. We intend to pay competitive salaries, bonuses and equity-based rewards in order to attract and retain such personnel, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such endeavors. The unexpected loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit, develop and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nThe mix of business we write affects our revenue stream and the likelihood of losses occurring.\nEven when housing values are stable or rising, mortgages with certain characteristics have higher probabilities of claims. These characteristics include loans with LTVs over 95% (or in certain markets that have experienced declining housing values, over 90%), lower credit scores, with lower scores tending to have higher probabilities of claims, or higher total DTI ratios. Loans with combinations of these risk factors have a higher degree of layered risk. In general, we charge higher premiums for loans with higher risk characteristics. There is, however, no guarantee that our premiums will compensate us for the losses we incur on loans with higher risk characteristics. From time to time, in response to market conditions, we may change the types of loans that we insure and the guidelines under which we insure them, and in doing so, the concentration of insured loans with higher risk characteristics in our portfolio may increase. In addition, we may make exceptions to our underwriting guidelines on a loan-by-loan basis and for certain customer programs. Even though underwriting that falls outside of our guidelines would be on a case-by-case basis, we could incur greater than expected claims and claim payments on this business, which could negatively impact our revenues and operating results.\nWe face risks associated with offering loan review services.\nWe provide loan review services for certain of our customers, including on loans for which we are not providing mortgage insurance. Under the terms of our loan review agreements with customers and subject to contractual limitations on liability, we provide these customers with limited indemnity rights if we make a material error in providing such services and the error materially restricts or impairs the saleability of a loan, results in a material reduction in the value of a loan or results in the customer being required to repurchase a loan. The indemnification may be in the form of monetary or other remedies, subject to per loan and annual limitations. Accordingly, we have assumed some credit risk in connection with providing these services. We also face regulatory and litigation risk in providing these services. See \"The U.S. MI industry is, and as a participant we will be, subject to litigation and regulatory enforcement risk generally,\" below.\nWe face risks in connection with managing our growth, which will depend on maintaining and enhancing effective operating procedures and internal controls.\nOur future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our growth. Our growth has placed, and it may continue to place, significant demands on our operations and management. Our current plan is dependent upon our ability to:\n\u2022\ncontinue to implement and improve our operational, credit, financial, management and other disclosure and internal risk controls and processes and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage a growing number of client relationships;\n\u2022\nscale our technology platform; and\n\u2022\nattract and retain management talent.\nWe may not successfully implement improvements to, or integrate, our management information and control systems, procedures and processes in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In particular, our controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in loan volume in various markets and the infrastructure that comes with new customers. If we are unable to manage future expansion in our operations, we may experience compliance and operational problems, be required to slow the pace of growth, or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth, any one of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur management does not expect that our disclosure and internal risk controls and processes will prevent all potential errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. As a result of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any ineffectiveness in our controls or procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on our systems, employees and third party service providers, and any errors or fraud could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud or malfeasance by employees and outsiders, including third-party service providers, clerical record-keeping errors and transactional errors. Our business is dependent on our employees as well as third parties to process a large number of transactions. We could be materially and adversely affected if one of our employees or one of our systems causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. Third parties with which we do business also could be sources of operational risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of such parties' own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results.\nIf servicers fail to adhere to appropriate servicing standards or experience disruptions to their businesses, our losses could unexpectedly increase.\nWe depend on reliable, consistent third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Among other things, our Master Policy requires our insureds and their servicers to timely submit premium and monthly IIF and default reports and use commercially reasonable efforts to limit and mitigate loss when a loan is in default. If these servicers fail to adhere to such servicing standards and fail to limit and mitigate loss when appropriate, our losses may unexpectedly increase. In addition, if one or more servicers were to experience adverse effects to its business, such servicers could experience delays in their reporting and premium payment requirements, which could result in our inability to correctly record new loans as they are underwritten, receive and process premium payments on insured loans and/or properly recognize and establish loss reserves on loans when a default exists or occurs but is not reported to us. Significant failures by large servicers or disruptions in the servicing of mortgage loans we insure would adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurthermore, we have delegated to the GSEs, who have in turn delegated to their approved servicers, authority to accept modifications, short sales and deeds-in-lieu on loans we insure. Servicers are required to operate under the GSEs' required standards in accepting certain loss mitigation alternatives. We are dependent on services to appropriately make these decisions under their delegated authority to mitigate our exposure to loss. In some cases, loss mitigation decisions favorable to the GSEs may not be favorable to us and may increase the incidence of paid claims. Inappropriate delegation procedures or failure of servicers to adhere to required standards may increase the magnitude of our losses and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers, and termination of third-party contracts, systems failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and on adequate performance of our third-party service providers. We outsource many of our major information technology functions, including for the development and operation of our enterprise technology platform, data center hosting and management, email and collaboration and human resource systems. We also outsource certain of our underwriting functions to third party service providers. The failure of any of these third parties to perform and/or deliver on a timely basis, or the failure of these systems, either individually or collectively, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of our systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third parties, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our information technology systems, which process, transmit, store and protect large amounts of personal information of the borrowers whose mortgages we insure, in addition to the confidential, proprietary, financial and other information that are critical to our business. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between our employees and our customers and service providers depends on information technology and electronic information exchange. The security of our computer systems and networks, and those functions that we may outsource, are vulnerable to unauthorized access, interruptions or failures due to events that may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to, cyber\nattacks, natural disasters, theft, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, and general technology failures. Additionally, our employees and vendors may use portable computers or mobile devices which can be stolen, lost or damaged. We have adopted information security procedures and controls to safeguard our systems and the information that we process, transmit and store. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, or detect and contain a breach in a timely manner, particularly because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. Any compromise of the security of our information technology systems may result in loss of personally identifiable information, financial losses, loss of customers and the inability to transact business; could be costly and time-consuming to address and resolve; could expose us to liability for damages, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and/or expose us to civil litigation. If any of these were to occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Further, the technology errors and omissions insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims and/or costs associated with incidents that may occur in the future.\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or a pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe could be exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, military actions and pandemics. For example, a natural or man-made disaster or a pandemic could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates as policyholders and contract holders who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations, such as payment of premiums on our insurance policies, interest payments due on our invested assets and mortgage payments on loans we insure. The continued threat of terrorism may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster or a pandemic could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas, as well as an adverse effect on home prices in those areas, which could result in unexpected increased loss experience in our business. Disasters or a pandemic also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations. In addition, a disaster or a pandemic could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio if it affects companies' ability to pay us principal or interest on their securities.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Mortgage Insurance Industry and Its Regulation\nThe implementation of Basel III may adversely affect the use of MI by certain banks.\nIn July 2013, U.S. federal banking regulators adopted regulations to implement Basel III. The phase in period for U.S. banks to implement the capital rules is for a duration of five years, which started on January 2, 2014. With the ongoing implementation of Basel III and the potential continued evolution of the Basel capital framework, it is difficult to predict the impact, if any, on the MI industry and the ultimate form of any potential future modifications to the regulations by federal banking regulators. If regulators revise the Basel III rules to reduce or eliminate the capital benefit banks receive from insuring low down payment loans with private MI, or if our customers who are subject to Basel III believe that adverse changes may occur at some time in the future, our current and future business may be adversely affected.\nContinued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act could negatively impact private mortgage insurers and the amount of insurance they can write, including if the definition of QRM results in a reduction of the number of low down payment loans available to be insured.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required certain federal regulators to promulgate regulations providing for minimum credit risk-retention requirements in securitizations of residential mortgage loans that do not meet the definition of QRM. The final QRM rule went into effect on February 23, 2015. We, and the industry, continue to evaluate the QRM rule and whether it will have any impact on the MI industry. The potential impact depends on, among other things, the mortgage finance market's reaction to the rule, including whether the rule will affect the size of the high-LTV mortgage market and the extent to which the GSEs' mortgage purchase and securitization activities become a smaller portion of the overall market and securitizations subject to the risk retention requirements and the QRM exemption become a larger part of the mortgage market. If the QRM rule has the effect of materially reducing the size of the high-LTV mortgage market and therefore the population of loans eligible for MI, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business prospects and operating results could be adversely impacted if, and to the extent that, the CFPB's ATR Rules defining a QM reduce the size of the origination market.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to issue regulations requiring a loan originator to determine whether, at the time a loan is originated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan (ATR). The CFPB's final ATR rule went into effect on\nJanuary 10, 2014. A subset of mortgages within the ATR rule are known as \"qualified mortgages\" or QM. QMs under the rule benefit from a statutory presumption of compliance with the ATR rule, thus potentially mitigating the risk of the liability of the creditor and assignees of the loan under TILA. We, along with other industry participants, have observed that the significant majority of covered loans made after the effective date of the CFPB's ATR rule have been QMs. We expect that most lenders will continue to be reluctant to make loans that do not qualify as QMs (either under specific underwriting guidelines in the rule or government or GSE underwriting guidelines) because absent full compliance with the ATR rule, such loans will not be entitled to a safe-harbor presumption of compliance with the ability-to-pay requirements. As a result, we believe ATR regulations have given rise to a subset of borrowers who cannot meet the regulatory QM standards, thus reducing the size of the residential mortgage market tied to such borrowers. It is difficult to predict with any certainty whether changes resulting from the QM rule will have a negative impact on the MI industry over time. Our business prospects and operating results could be adversely impacted if, and to the extent that, the QM regulations have the impact of reducing the size of the origination market.\nIn addition, there are certain aspects of the ATR regulations that could have an adverse impact on mortgage insurers. Under the QM regulations, if the lender requires the borrower to purchase MI, then the MI premiums are included in monthly mortgage costs in determining the borrower's ability to repay the loan. The demand for MI may decrease if, and to the extent that, monthly MI premiums make it less likely that a loan will qualify for QM status, especially if MI alternatives (discussed below in \"-The amount of insurance we may be able to write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to MI.\") are relatively less expensive than MI.\nIn addition, under the QM regulations, mortgage insurance premiums that are payable at or prior to consummation of the loan are includible in points and fees unless, and to the extent that, such up-front premiums (UFP) are (i) less than or equal to the UFP charged by the FHA, and (ii) are automatically refundable on a pro rata basis upon satisfaction of the loan. (The FHA currently charges UFP of 1.75% on all residential mortgage loans, but it has the authority to change its UFP from time to time.) The QM rule includes a limitation on points and fees of 3% of the total loan amount. As inclusion of MI premiums towards the 3% cap will reduce the capacity for other points and fees in covered transactions, mortgage originators are less likely to purchase single premium BPMI products to the extent that the associated premiums are deemed to be points and fees.\nChanges in the business practices of the GSEs, including a decision to decrease or discontinue the use of MI, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses.\nThe requirements and practices of the GSEs impact the operating results and financial performance of MI companies. Changes in the charters or business practices of Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae could reduce the number of mortgages they purchase that are insured by us and consequently diminish our franchise value. The GSEs could be directed to make such changes by the FHFA, which was appointed as their conservator in September 2008 and has the authority to control and direct the operations of the GSEs.\nWith the GSEs in a prolonged conservatorship, there has been ongoing debate over the future role and purpose of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market. The U.S. Congress may legislate structural and other changes to the GSEs and the functioning of the secondary mortgage market. Since 2011, there have been numerous legislative proposals intended to incrementally scale back the GSEs (such as a statutory mandate for the GSEs to transfer mortgage credit risk to the private sector) or to completely reform the housing finance system. Congress, however, has not enacted any legislation to date. The proposals vary greatly with regard to the government's role in the housing market, and more specifically, with regard to the existence of an explicit or implicit government guarantee. If any GSE reform legislation is enacted, it could impact the current role of private mortgage insurance as credit enhancement, including its reduction or elimination, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue, operating results or financial condition. As a result of these matters, it is uncertain what role private capital, including MI, will play in the domestic residential housing finance system in the future or the impact of any such changes on our business. In addition, the timing of the impact on our business is uncertain. Any changes to the charters or statutory authorities of the GSEs would require Congressional action to implement. Passage and timing of any comprehensive GSE reform legislation or incremental change is uncertain and could change through the legislative process, which could take time, making the actual impact on us and our industry difficult to predict. With the new Trump Administration and Republican majority in Congress (including the resulting control of key committees addressing GSE reform), there is a possibility for greater consensus, although much uncertainty remains regarding the details of any reform as well as when it would be enacted or implemented. Any such changes that come to pass could have a significant impact on our business.\nIn recent years, the FHFA has set goals for the GSEs to transfer significant portions of the GSEs' mortgage credit risk to the private sector. To date, several credit risk transfer products have been created under the program. To the extent these credit risk products evolve in a manner that displaces primary MI coverage, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced. It is difficult to predict the impact of alternative credit risk transfer products, if any, that are developed in order to meet the goals established by the FHFA.\nThe U.S. MI industry is subject to regulatory risk and has been subject to increased scrutiny by insurance and other regulatory authorities.\nThe U.S. MI industry and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive federal and state regulation, which has increased in recent years as a result of the most recent financial crisis. Increased federal or state regulatory scrutiny could lead to new legal precedents, new regulations or new practices, or regulatory actions or investigations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Given the significant losses incurred by many insurers in the mortgage and financial guaranty industries during the most recent financial downturn, we and our industry may be subject to heightened scrutiny by insurance regulators. Although their scope varies, state insurance laws generally grant broad supervisory powers to state insurance regulatory authorities to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business. These state insurance regulatory authorities could take actions that could materially impact the types of products and services we and our industry are permitted to offer, including requiring us (and other MI companies) to modify current business practices. Further, failure to comply with the various federal and state regulations promulgated by federal consumer protection authorities and state insurance regulatory authorities could lead to enforcement or disciplinary action, including the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate.\nState insurance regulators also have the authority to make changes to capital requirements. The NAIC has formed a working group to develop and recommend more robust regulations governing mortgage insurance, including, among other things, strengthened capital requirements, underwriting standards, claims practices and market conduct. We, along with other MI companies, are working with the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Working Group of the Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC (Working Group). The Working Group will determine and make a recommendation to the Financial Condition (E) Committee of the NAIC as to what changes the Working Group believes are necessary to the solvency and market practices regulation of MI companies, including changes to the Mortgage Guaranty Insurers Model Act (Model #630). The Working Group has proposed a draft revised Model Act that contains risk-based capital requirements, which we and the MI industry are evaluating. We have provided feedback to the Working Group since early 2013, including comments on the risk-based capital approach. The Working Group's discussions are ongoing and the ultimate outcome of these discussions and any potential actions taken by the NAIC cannot be predicted at this time. If the Working Group's final proposal to the NAIC contains more stringent capital requirements, this could ultimately lead to NMIC being obligated to hold more capital for its insured business than we are required to hold under PMIERs, which would reduce our profitability compared to the profitability we expect under the existing capital requirements.\nA downturn in the U.S. economy, rising interest rates or home price depreciation may result in increased, unexpected borrower defaults, which could increase our losses.\nLosses result from events that reduce a borrower's ability to continue to make mortgage payments, such as unemployment, rising interest rates and whether a defaulting borrower can sell the home for an amount that will cover unpaid principal and interest and the expenses of the sale. Deterioration in economic conditions generally increases the likelihood that borrowers will not have sufficient income to pay their mortgages. An increase in interest rates typically leads to higher monthly payments for borrowers with existing ARMs. A decline in home values typically makes it more difficult for borrowers to sell or refinance their homes, generally increasing the likelihood of a default followed by a claim if borrowers experience job losses or other life events which reduce their incomes or increase their expenses. In addition, adverse declines in home values may also decrease the willingness of borrowers with sufficient resources to make mortgage payments when their mortgage balances exceed the values of their homes. Declines in home values typically increase the severity of any claims we may pay. Home values may decline even absent deterioration in economic conditions due to declines in demand for homes, which in turn may result from changes in buyers' perceptions of the potential for future appreciation, rising interest rates or restrictions on mortgage credit due to more stringent underwriting standards, among other factors.\nLosses can increase when borrowers whose loans we insure experience reductions in income or increases in expenses. Borrowers on low down payment mortgages often have more difficulty weathering financial hardships caused by unemployment or income reductions, or life events involving illness or divorce, because they may not have large amounts of personal savings or available credit. Rising unemployment may increase the number of borrowers unable to remain current on their home mortgages and may increase the number of new claims.\nIf our loss projections are inaccurate, our loss payments could materially exceed our recorded loss reserves resulting in an adverse effect on our financial position and operating results. Also, if unemployment rates materially exceed and home price trends materially differ from our forecasts, our underwriting standards and premium charges may prove inadequate to shield us from materially increased losses.\nChanges in interest rates, house prices or mortgage insurance cancellation requirements may change the length of time that our policies remain in force .\nThe premium from a single premium policy is collected up front and generally earned over the estimated life of the policy. In contrast, premiums from a monthly premium policy are received and earned each month over the life of the policy. In each year, most of our premiums will be from insurance that has been written in prior years. As a result, the length of time insurance remains in force, which is also generally referred to as persistency, is a significant determinant of our revenues. A lower level of persistency could reduce our future revenues from our monthly-paid premium products, which constituted about 60% of our IIF at year end 2016. In contrast, a higher than expected persistency rate will decrease the profitability from single premium policies because they will remain in force longer than was estimated when the policies were written. The factors affecting persistency include:\n\u2022\nthe level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on the IIF, which affects the vulnerability of the IIF to refinancings (i.e., lower current interest rates make it more attractive for borrowers to refinance and receive a lower interest rate);\n\u2022\nchanges in rates of home price appreciation or depreciation;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions that affect a borrower's decision to pay-off a mortgage earlier than required;\n\u2022\nlenders' credit policies, which may make it more difficult for borrowers to refinance their loans; and\n\u2022\nmortgage insurance cancellation policies of mortgage investors, along with the current value of the homes underlying the mortgages in the IIF.\nMortgage interest rates have remained historically low, but will likely rise as a result of expected future changes in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Future premiums on our IIF represent a material portion of our claims paying resources. We are unsure what the impact on our revenues will be as mortgages are refinanced, because the number of policies we write for replacement mortgages may be more or less than the terminated policies associated with the refinanced mortgages. Given this dynamic, our expected revenues from monthly premium policies in particular might be negatively impacted if there is a higher than expected level of refinance activity in the future. In addition, if interest rates rise, persistency is likely to increase, which may extend the average life of our insured portfolio and increase expected future claims.\nThe amount of insurance we may be able to write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to MI.\nIf lenders and investors select alternatives to MI on high LTV loans, our business could be adversely affected. These alternatives to MI include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nlenders using government mortgage insurance programs, including those of the FHA and the VA;\n\u2022\nlenders and other investors holding mortgages in portfolio and self-insuring;\n\u2022\ninvestors (including the GSEs) using credit enhancements other than MI (including alternative forms of credit risk transfer), using other credit enhancements in conjunction with reduced levels of MI coverage, or accepting credit risk without credit enhancement;\n\u2022\nlenders originating mortgages using \"piggy-back\" or other structures to avoid MI, such as a first mortgage with an 80% LTV and a second mortgage with a 10%, 15% or 20% LTV (referred to as 80-10-10, 80-15-5 or 80-20 loans, respectively) rather than a first mortgage with an LTV above 80% that has MI;\n\u2022\nstate-supported mortgage insurance funds in several states, including California and New York; and\n\u2022\nborrowers paying cash or making large down payments versus securing mortgage financing, which has occurred with greater frequency in the years following the most recent financial crisis.\nAny of these alternatives to MI could reduce or eliminate the need for our product, could cause us to lose business and/or could limit our ability to attract the business that we would prefer to underwrite.\nSince 2008, government mortgage insurance programs, principally the FHA, have captured a significant share of the insured loan market. While declining from peak market share following the most recent financial crisis, the market share of governmental agencies remains substantially above their historically low market share prior to 2008. Government mortgage insurance programs are not subject to the same capital requirements, costs of capital, risk tolerance or business objectives that we and other private MI companies are, and therefore, generally have greater financial flexibility in setting their pricing, guidelines and capacity, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. In 2015, the FHA reduced some of its single-family annual mortgage insurance premiums,\nwhich had the effect of maintaining the FHA's elevated market share and continuing the increased role of government in the mortgage insurance market. In January 2017, the FHA announced further reductions to its annual premiums; however, before such reductions could take effect, the FHA announced the cuts were suspended indefinitely. With the new Trump Administration, it remains uncertain whether the FHA will ultimately adopt the suspended reductions or otherwise reduce its mortgage insurance premiums again in the future. The FHA may continue to maintain a strong market position and could increase its market share in the future.\nFactors that could cause the FHA or other government-supported mortgage insurance programs to remain significant include:\n\u2022\nfederal housing policy, including future premium reductions or loosening of underwriting guidelines;\n\u2022\nincreases in premium rates or tightening of underwriting guidelines by private MI companies;\n\u2022\nincreases to or imposition of new GSE loan delivery fees on loans that require mortgage insurance, which may result in higher borrower costs for MI loans compared to government insured loans;\n\u2022\nloans insured under Federal government-supported mortgage insurance programs are eligible for securitization in Ginnie Mae securities, which may be viewed by investors as more desirable than GSE securities due to the explicit backing of Ginnie Mae securities by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Federal government.\n\u2022\ndifference in the spread between GSE mortgage-backed securities and Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities;\n\u2022\nincrease in FHA loan limits above GSE loan limits;\n\u2022\nperceived operational ease of using government-sponsored mortgage insurance compared to private MI.\nIf government-supported mortgage insurance programs maintain or increase their share of the mortgage insurance market, our business and industry could be negatively affected.\nFurther, at the direction of the FHFA, the GSEs have expanded their credit risk transfer programs. These programs have included the use of structured finance vehicles, obtaining insurance from non-mortgage insurers, including off-shore reinsurance, engaging in credit-linked note transactions in the capital markets, or using other forms of debt issuances or securitizations that transfer credit risk directly to other investors. The growing success of these programs and the perception that some of these risk-sharing structures have beneficial features in comparison to private MI (e.g., lower costs, reduced counter-party risk due to collateral requirements or more diversified insurance exposures) may create increased competition for private MI on loans traditionally sold to the GSEs with private MI.\nThe degree to which lenders or borrowers may select these alternatives now, or in the future, is difficult to predict. As one or more of the alternatives described above, or new alternatives that enter the market, are chosen over MI, our revenues could be adversely impacted. The loss of business in general or the specific loss of more profitable business could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results.\nIf the volume of low down payment loan originations declines, the amount of insurance that we may be able to write could decline, which would reduce our revenues.\nOur revenues, in part, depend on the volume of low down payment loan originations and may be negatively affected if the volume declines. The factors that affect the volume of low down payment loan originations include, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on mortgage credit due to more stringent underwriting standards, more restrictive regulatory and capital requirements and liquidity issues affecting lenders;\n\u2022\nthe level of loan interest rates. Higher interest rates may increase the potential housing costs of consumers hoping to purchase homes, which may have the effect of reducing the pool of potential borrowers available to purchase homes;\n\u2022\ndeductibility of mortgage interest or mortgage insurance premiums for income tax purposes;\n\u2022\nthe health of the real estate industry and the national economy as well as conditions in regional and local economies;\n\u2022\nhousing affordability;\n\u2022\npopulation trends, including the rate of household formation;\n\u2022\nthe rate of home price appreciation, which in times of heavy refinancing can affect whether refinance loans have LTVs that require MI;\n\u2022\nU.S. government housing policy encouraging loans to first-time homebuyers; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which the GSEs' guaranty and other fees, credit underwriting guidelines and other business terms affect\nlenders' willingness to extend credit for low down payment mortgages.\nA decline in the volume of low down payment loan originations could decrease demand for MI, decrease our NIW and therefore reduce our revenues and have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe U.S. MI industry is, and as a participant we will be, subject to litigation and regulatory enforcement risk generally.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries that inherently pose a heightened risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings. As a result, the members of the MI industry, including NMIC, face litigation risk, including the risk of class action lawsuits, and administrative enforcement by federal agencies in the ordinary course of operations. Litigation and enforcement actions relating to capital markets transactions and securities-related matters in general has increased as a result of the most recent financial crisis. Consumers continue to bring lawsuits against home mortgage lenders and settlement service providers.\nMortgage insurers have been involved in litigation alleging violations of Section 8 of RESPA. Among other things, Section 8 of RESPA generally precludes mortgage insurers from paying referral fees to mortgage lenders for the referral of MI business. This limitation also can prohibit providing services or products to mortgage lenders free of charge, charging fees for services that are lower than their reasonable or fair market value, and paying fees for services that mortgage lenders provide that are higher than their reasonable or fair market value, in exchange for the referral of MI business. Various regulators, including the CFPB, state insurance commissioners and state attorneys general may bring actions seeking various forms of relief in connection with alleged violations of the referral fee limitations of RESPA, as well as by private litigants in class actions. The insurance law provisions of many states also prohibit paying for the referral of insurance business and provide various mechanisms to enforce this prohibition.\nIn the past, a number of lawsuits have challenged the actions of other MI companies under RESPA, alleging that the insurers have violated RESPA Section 8's referral fee prohibition by entering into captive reinsurance arrangements or providing products or services to mortgage lenders at improperly reduced prices in return for the referral of MI. In addition to these private lawsuits, other MI companies received Civil Investigative Demands from the CFPB and state insurance regulators as part of their respective investigations to determine whether mortgage lenders and mortgage insurance providers engaged in acts or practices in connection with their captive mortgage insurance arrangements in violation of RESPA and state insurance laws. In 2013, the CFPB entered into consent orders with five other MI companies settling the CFPB's allegations related to those MI companies' respective captive arrangements. One CFPB enforcement action against a mortgage originator for alleged kickbacks received from mortgage insurers, in which the CFPB ordered the mortgage originator to pay approximately $109 million in disgorgement, is currently pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit initially overturned the CFPB's order on multiple grounds, including finding fault with the CFPB's interpretation of Section 8 of RESPA.That court's ruling (which also addresses the constitutionality of the CFPB's single director structure) was then stayed pending the CFPB's request that the entire appeals court review the ruling. The D.C. Circuit subsequently granted the CFPB's request and vacated the initial judgment, and the case is currently set for hearing by the entire appeals court in May, 2017. The ultimate ruling in this case may have an impact on future CFPB enforcement activity. The CFPB's enforcement of Section 8 of RESPA presents regulatory risk for many providers of \"settlement services,\" including mortgage insurers.\nWe currently are not a party to any federal or state regulatory enforcement actions; however, such proceedings could arise in the future. The cost to defend, and the ultimate resolution of, any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Should we become a party to an action by any of these various regulators, the ultimate outcome is difficult to predict, and it is possible that any outcome could be negative to us specifically or the industry in general and such a negative outcome could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nWe are involved in certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Based upon information available to us and our review of lawsuits and claims filed or pending against us to date, we have not recognized a material liability for these matters, nor do we currently expect it is reasonably possible that these matters will result in a material liability to us. However, the outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that one or more of such matters currently pending or threatened could have an unanticipated material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur Credit Agreement contains various restrictive covenants and required financial ratios and tests that limit our operating flexibility. The violation of one or more of these covenants, ratios and tests could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2015, NMIH entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement) providing for a term loan credit facility in the original principal amount of $150 million (the Term Loan), which matures on November 10, 2019. The Credit Agreement\ncontains various restrictive covenants and required financial ratios and tests that we are required to meet or maintain and that limit our operating flexibility.\nAmong other requirements, NMIH may not permit (i) our debt to total capitalization ratio to exceed 35% as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, (ii) the aggregate amount of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of any date to be less than the sum of all remaining scheduled interest payments and amortization payments in respect of the Term Loan as of such date (excluding principal and interest scheduled to be paid on the maturity date) or (iii) our total shareholders' equity to be less than $307,788,750 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. In addition, NMIC must remain at all times in compliance with all applicable \"financial requirements\" imposed pursuant to the PMIERs.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement prohibits or restricts, among other things, NMIH's and its subsidiaries' ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens on their property;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nsell their assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans or investments;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates,\nin each case subject to certain exceptions and qualifications as set forth in the Credit Agreement.\nThese covenants place significant restrictions on the manner in which we may operate our business, and our ability to meet these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we fail to meet any of these covenants, the lenders could declare the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts owing and payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to assess our ability to continue as a going concern as part of our preparation of financial statements at each quarter-end. This assessment includes, among other things, our ability to comply with the covenants and requirements under the Credit Agreement. If in future periods we are not able to demonstrate that we will be in compliance with the financial covenant requirements in the Credit Agreement for at least 12 months following the date of the financial statements, management could conclude there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and the audit opinion that we would receive from our independent registered public accounting firm would include an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Such an opinion would cause us to be in breach of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.\nNMIH\u2019s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed (Guarantee) by one of its subsidiaries, NMIS (the Guarantor). NMIH\u2019s and the Guarantor\u2019s obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Guarantee, respectively, are secured by first-priority liens on substantially all the assets of NMIH and the Guarantor, respectively, subject to certain exceptions. If we fail to make the required payments, do not meet the financial covenants or otherwise default on the terms of the Credit Agreement, the lenders under the Credit Agreement could declare all of the obligations under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. We cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay such amounts in full, and the lenders could foreclose on the collateral securing the Credit Agreement and the Guarantee, including, subject to regulatory approval, the stock of NMIC and Re One. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is a risk NMIH will have insufficient liquidity to repay the Credit Agreement when it matures in 2019.\nDuring the remaining term of the Credit Agreement, we are required to pay interest on the Term Loan of a Eurodollar based rate (1% floor) plus an annual margin rate of 6.75% and repay principal of 1% of the original loan amount, which we pay in quarterly installments at the end of each calendar quarter. NMIH's current holdings in cash and highly liquid investments are sufficient to meet these principal and interest obligations during the term, but not to repay the outstanding principal of the Term Loan at maturity. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of NMIH, including the capital stock of NMIC and Re One. Due to restrictions on dividend payments (and other intercompany transfers) under the PMIERs, as well as various state laws, it is unlikely that NMIC will be able to make shareholder dividends to NMIH during the term, and thus we do not expect NMIC's capital will be available to NMIH for loan repayment purposes. See \u201cOur holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations and potentially require us to raise more capital,\u201d below. If NMIH is unable to\nextend or refinance the Term Loan and/or raise capital, it will not be able to repay the Term Loan at maturity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations and potentially require us to raise more capital.\nNMIH serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. NMIH's principal source of operating cash is investment income, and could include future dividends from NMIC, if available and permitted under law or by state insurance regulators or the GSEs. In addition, NMIH currently receives cash from our insurance subsidiaries, consisting of payments made under our tax and expense-sharing arrangements. NMIH depends on these sources of liquidity to make principal and interest payments under the Credit Agreement and to pay certain corporate expenses and income taxes, among other things. If payments to NMIH were curtailed or limited, there is a risk that NMIH would be unable to satisfy its financial obligations.\nNMIC is a monoline insurance company restricted to writing residential MI business only, and Re One solely provides reinsurance to NMIC for purposes of compliance with statutory coverage limits. The expense-sharing arrangements between us and our subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Wisconsin OCI, but such approval may be revoked at any time.\nOur dividend income is limited to upstream dividend payments from our subsidiaries, which dividends are restricted by Wisconsin law. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed \"extraordinary\" and require approval of the Wisconsin OCI. Further, it is possible that Wisconsin will adopt revised statutory provisions or interpretations of existing statutory provisions that could be more restrictive than those currently in effect or will otherwise take actions that may further restrict the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or returns of capital. As a result of these dividend limitations, we do not expect to receive dividend income from our subsidiaries for several years, if at all.\nIn addition, to support NMIC's future growth, we could be required to provide additional capital support for NMIC and Re One if additional capital is required pursuant to insurance laws and regulations or by the GSEs. If we were unable to meet our obligations, our insurance subsidiaries could lose GSE approval and/or be required to cease writing business in one or more states, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent that the funds generated from investment income or by our ongoing operations and capitalization are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through future financing activities, reduce our RIF, including through additional reinsurance, or curtail our growth and reduce our expenses. NMIH's future capital requirements depend on many factors, including NMIC's ability to successfully write new business, establish premium rates at levels sufficient to cover claims and operating costs and meet minimum required asset thresholds under the PMIERs. We expect to continue to seek reinsurance as the primary means of reducing our net RIF to support our future NIW growth. We may choose to generate additional liquidity through the issuance of additional debt, equity or a combination of both. We can give no assurance that our efforts to raise capital, obtain additional reinsurance or otherwise reduce our RIF would be successful. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur existing, and any future, variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur indebtedness under the Credit Agreement is, and our future indebtedness may be, subject to variable rates of interest, exposing us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on such variable rate indebtedness would increase, resulting in a reduction of our net income that could be significant, even though the principal amount borrowed would remain the same.\nOur current credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access capital and the cost of such capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current issuer credit and debt ratings are below investment grade. Our current credit ratings, or any future negative actions the credit agencies may take, could affect our ability to access the reinsurance, credit and capital markets in the future and could lead to worsened trade terms and adversely affect the cost, increasing our liquidity needs. An inability to access reinsurance, capital and credit markets when needed in order to continue to grow our business, refinance our existing debt or raise new debt or equity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nDespite our substantial level of debt, we may incur more debt, which could exacerbate any or all of the risks described above.\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although our Credit Agreement limits our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Credit Agreement does not prevent us from incurring certain obligations that do not constitute \u201cindebtedness\u201d as defined therein. To the extent that we incur additional debt or such other obligations, the risks associated with our Credit Agreement described above, including our possible inability to service our debt or other obligations, would increase.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the near future, and payment of any declared dividends may be delayed.\nWe are required to obtain prior approval from the GSEs for the payment of any dividend by NMIC, and we will have to obtain permission from our state of domicile regulator, the Wisconsin OCI or any successor domestic regulator, for the payment of any extraordinary dividend. Without the payment of dividends from NMIC to us, it may be difficult for us to pay dividends to stockholders.\nWe have not declared or paid dividends in the past, and we do not expect to pay dividends in the near future. We currently intend to retain all of our earnings, if any, to fund our growth. As a result, only appreciation in the price of our common stock, which may not continue to occur, will provide a return to investors. Any future declaration and payment of dividends by our Board will depend on many factors, including general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans, our financial results and condition, legal requirements and other factors that our Board deems relevant. In addition, we may enter into additional credit agreements or other debt arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 59,145,161 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the shares held by a person (or persons whose shares are aggregated) who is not deemed to be an affiliate of ours at any time during the three months preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act may be eligible for resale in the public market under Rule 144 under the Securities Act subject to applicable restrictions under Rule 144. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market in the future, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future, at a time and place that we deem appropriate.\nIn addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register an aggregate of 5.5 million shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2012 Stock Incentive Plan and an aggregate of 4 million shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Any shares issued in connection with acquisitions, the exercise of stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by investors who purchase our shares.\nFuture issuances of shares of our common stock may depress our share price and might dilute the book value of our common stock and reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.\nWe have the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares that may be issued to satisfy our obligations under our incentive plans, and securities and instruments that are convertible into our common stock. Although we are currently in compliance with state regulatory capital and PMIERs financial requirements, there can be no assurance we would not seek to raise additional equity capital to manage our capital position under PMIERs, state insurance law, to grow our book of business and for other purposes, including to pay off our Term Loan. Such stock issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium from the then-current trading price of our common stock and might dilute the book value of our common stock or result in a decrease in the per share price of our common stock.\nFuture issuance of debt or preferred stock, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our liquidation, may adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by issuing additional debt, including bank debt, commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes or classes of shares of preferred stock. Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that would limit amounts available for distribution to holders of shares of our common stock. Accordingly, in the event of our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred\nstock and lenders with respect to our Credit Agreement or other future borrowings, if any, would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of shares of our common stock. Any decision to issue debt or preferred stock in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors, some of which will be beyond our control. We cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of such future issuances. Holders of our common stock bear the risk of such future issuances of debt or preferred stock reducing the market value of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for stockholders to sell their shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times desired. There are many factors that impact the market price of our common stock, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions, including price levels and volume and changes in interest rates;\n\u2022\nnational, regional and local economic or business conditions;\n\u2022\nthe effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. housing and housing finance policy, including changes to the GSEs;\n\u2022\nour actual or projected financial condition, liquidity, operating results, cash flows and capital levels;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or failure to meet, our publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial and operating performance;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us, our competitors or the financial services industry generally, or changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts' estimates of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;\n\u2022\nmarket valuations, as well as the financial and operating performance and prospects, of similar companies;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances or sales, or anticipated issuances or sales, of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock;\n\u2022\nadditional indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in connection with changes in our stock price, such as changes in the value of the liability reflected on our financial statements associated with outstanding warrants;\n\u2022\nthe potential failure to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nour failure to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ;\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and\n\u2022\nour treatment as an EGC under the federal securities laws.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, stockholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources and harm our business or operating results.\nThe benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 382).\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $121.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) that we can use in certain circumstances to offset future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability. Our ability to fully utilize our existing NOLs could be limited or eliminated in various ways, including (i) if we experience an \"ownership change\" within the meaning of Section 382; (ii) due to changes in federal laws and regulations that could negatively impact our ability to recognize benefits from our NOLs; or (iii) should we not attain sufficient profitability prior to the expiration of the NOLs. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income to be able to fully utilize our NOLs prior to their expiration.\nAn \"ownership change,\" under Section 382, is generally defined as greater than a 50% change in equity ownership by value over a rolling three-year period. These rules generally operate by focusing on changes in the ownership among shareholders owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a company's common stock (including changes involving a shareholder becoming a 5% shareholder) or any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock or share repurchases by the company. We could experience an \"ownership change\" in the future as a result of changes in our common stock ownership that may or may not be within our control. If an ownership change were to occur, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of NOLs we could use to reduce our taxable income. A number of complex rules apply in calculating this annual limit, which could be material and could significantly impair the value of our net deferred tax assets and, as a result, have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are an EGC and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to EGCs may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an EGC, we are relieved from certain significant requirements, including, among other things, the requirement to comply with certain provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and the Dodd-Frank Act and certain provisions and reporting requirements of or under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, which has the effect of reducing the amount of information that we are required to provide for the foreseeable future. For example, as an EGC, we are exempt from complying with Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley, which otherwise would have required our auditors to attest to and report on our internal control over financial reporting. These reduced disclosure requirements may make our common stock less attractive to investors. To the extent that other companies do not, or cannot, take advantage of the benefits under the JOBS Act, this distinction may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nProvisions contained in our organizational documents, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could delay or prevent a change of control of us, which could adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board. Our corporate governance documents include provisions that:\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders generally can only be called by the chairman of the Board or the president or by resolution of the Board;\n\u2022\nprovide our Board the ability to issue undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may grant preferred holders voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holder of common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide our Board the ability to issue common stock and warrants within the amount of authorized capital;\n\u2022\nprovide that, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock with respect to such series of preferred stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of our stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders; and\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders, generally must provide timely advance notice of their intent in writing and certain other information not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the meeting.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes of control of the Company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law. The Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL) provides that stockholders are not entitled the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless a corporation's certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination (as defined in such section) with an \"interested stockholder\" (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation or any person affiliated with such person) for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless (i) prior to such time, the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced (excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in\nwhich the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan); or (iii) on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder.\nIn addition, Wisconsin's insurance regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control of us unless the transaction in which control is acquired has been approved by the Wisconsin OCI. The regulations provide for a rebuttable presumption of control when a person owns or has the right to vote more than 10% of the voting securities. In addition, the insurance regulations of other states in which NMIC and/or Re One are licensed insurers require notification to the state's insurance department a specified period before a person acquires control of us. If regulators in these states disapprove the change of control, our licenses to conduct business in the disapproving states could be terminated.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law or under the Wisconsin insurance regulation that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14318, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "NMIH"}
