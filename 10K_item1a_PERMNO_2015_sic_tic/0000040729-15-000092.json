{"cik": "40729", "company": "Ally Financial Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur businesses face many risks and uncertainties, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We believe that the most significant of the risks and uncertainties that we face are described below. This Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations that require significant expense and devotion of resources, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Ally currently operates as a FHC, which permits us to engage in certain business activities, including securities, insurance, and merchant banking activities. To maintain status as a FHC, Ally and its bank subsidiary, Ally Bank, must remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell-managed,\u201d as defined under applicable law. If we fail to maintain our status as a FHC, our ability to engage in the broader range of activities permitted to FHCs may be restricted and we may be required to discontinue these activities, or divest our bank subsidiary, Ally Bank.\nAlly is subject to ongoing supervision, examination and regulation by the FRB, and Ally Bank by the FDIC and the Utah DFI, in each case, through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management\u2019s ability to identify, assess, and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe-and-sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. In the course of their supervision and examinations, our regulators may require improvements in various functions or areas of our business. Any requirement imposed is generally judicially enforceable, and if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal supervisory actions that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to develop any new business. Such forms of supervisory action could include, without limitation, written agreements, cease and desist orders, and consent orders and may, among other things, result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, requirements to increase capital, restrictions on our activities, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and enforcement of such action through injunctions or restraining orders. We could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our operations in that market with regard to the affected product and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, or that we will not be prohibited by local laws or regulators from taking desired actions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, or results of operations.\nChanges to any applicable statutes, regulations, rules, or policies including the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, rules, or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties to offer competing financial services and products. Further, noncompliance with applicable laws could result in the suspension or revocation of any license or registration at issue as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.\nFor additional information related to our regulatory requirements, see Business - Certain Regulatory Matters.\nAlly and its subsidiaries are or may become involved in investigations, examinations, and proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies, which may lead to material adverse consequences.\nAlly and its subsidiaries, including Ally Bank, are or may become involved from time to time in formal and informal reviews, investigations, examinations, proceedings, and information-gathering requests by federal and state government and self-regulatory agencies, including, among others, the DOJ, SEC, CFPB, FRB, FDIC, Utah DFI, and the Federal Trade Commission regarding their respective operations.\nMortgage Matters\nWe have received subpoenas from the DOJ that include a broad request for documentation and other information relating to residential mortgage-backed securities issued by our former mortgage subsidiary, Residential Capital, LLC and its subsidiaries (ResCap RMBS). In connection with these requests, the DOJ is investigating potential fraud and other potential legal claims related to ResCap RMBS, including its investigation of potential claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. The DOJ is also\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\ninvestigating potential claims under the False Claims Act (FCA) related to representations made by us in connection with investments in Ally made by the United States Department of the Treasury pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008 and 2009 regarding certain claims against Residential Capital, LLC or its subsidiaries at that time. We are engaged in ongoing discussions with the DOJ with respect to legal and factual aspects of their investigations. Further, at the request of the DOJ, we have entered into an agreement to voluntarily extend the statutes of limitations related to potential FCA claims.\nWe have separately received subpoenas and document requests from the SEC that include information covering a wide range of mortgage-related matters.\nAutomotive Subprime Matters\nIn October 2014 we received a document request from the SEC in connection with its investigation related to subprime automotive finance and related securitization activities. Separately, in December 2014, we received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting similar information. We are currently cooperating with both the SEC and DOJ with respect to these matters.\nCFPB\nFurther, in December 2013, Ally Financial Inc. and Ally Bank entered into Consent Orders issued by the CFPB and the DOJ pertaining to the allegation of disparate impact in the automotive finance business, which resulted in a $98 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Consent Orders require Ally to create a compliance plan addressing, at a minimum, the communication of Ally\u2019s expectations of Equal Credit Opportunity Act compliance to dealers, maintenance of Ally\u2019s existing limits on dealer finance income for contracts acquired by Ally, and monitoring for potential discrimination both at the dealer level and within our portfolio of contracts acquired across all dealers. Ally formed a compliance committee consisting of certain Ally and Ally Bank directors to oversee Ally\u2019s execution of the Consent Orders\u2019 terms. Ally is required to meet certain stipulations under the Consent Orders, including a requirement to make future payments should certain remediation targets not be attained.\nEach of the matters set forth above may result in material adverse consequences including without limitation, adverse judgments, significant settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other actions.\nOur ability to execute our business strategy may be affected by regulatory considerations.\nOur business strategy for Ally Bank, which is primarily focused on automotive lending and growth of our direct-channel deposit business, is subject to regulatory oversight from a safety and soundness perspective. If our banking supervisors raise concerns regarding any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank, we may be obliged to alter our strategy, which could include moving certain activities, such as certain types of lending, outside of Ally Bank to one of our nonbanking affiliates. Alternative funding sources outside of Ally Bank, such as unsecured funding in the capital markets, could be more expensive than funding through Ally Bank and could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to capital planning and systemic risk regimes, which impose significant restrictions and requirements.\nAs a BHC with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets, Ally is required to conduct periodic stress tests and submit a proposed capital action plan to the FRB annually. The proposed capital action plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on Ally\u2019s consolidated capital. The proposed capital action plan must also include a discussion of how Ally will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and above a Tier 1 common equity-to-total-risk-weighted assets ratio of 5 percent, and serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to a proposed capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide notice of non-objection to Ally. The failure to receive a notice of non-objection from the FRB would prohibit us from paying dividends and making other capital distributions. Refer to Business - Certain Regulatory Matters for further details.\nIn addition, in February 2014, the FRB issued a final rule to implement certain of the enhanced prudential standards mandated by Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act for large bank holding companies such as Ally. The final rule generally became effective on January 1, 2015. Among other things, the final rule requires Ally to maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event and implement various liquidity-related corporate governance measures and imposes certain requirements, duties and qualifications for Ally\u2019s risk committee and chief risk officer. These enhanced prudential standards could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the FRB has stated that it will issue, at a later date, final rules to implement certain other enhanced prudential standards mandated by Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, including single counterparty credit limits and an early remediation framework. Once implemented and adopted, these rules could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOur ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.\nAlly Bank continues to be a key part of our funding strategy, and we have continued to place greater reliance on deposits as a source of funding through Ally Bank. Ally Bank does not have a retail branch network. It obtains its deposits through direct banking as well as brokered deposits. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher interest rates. Brokered deposits totaled $9.9 billion at December 31, 2014, which represented 17% of Ally Bank total deposits. Our ability to maintain our current level of deposits or grow our deposit base could be affected by regulatory restrictions including the possible imposition of prior approval requirements, restrictions on deposit growth, or restrictions on our rates offered. In addition, perceptions of our financial strength, rates offered by third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size of our deposit base. In addition, our regulators may impose restrictions on our ability to fund certain types of assets at Ally Bank, potentially raising the cost of funding those activities without the use of Ally Bank deposits. Qualitative and quantitative liquidity requirements imposed by the U.S. banking regulators may also impact our funding strategy.\nFinancial services legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has and will continue to substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate. Certain portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective immediately, and others have become effective since enactment, while others are subject to further rulemaking, transition periods, and the discretion of various regulatory bodies. The Dodd-Frank Act, when fully implemented, will have material implications for Ally and the entire financial services industry. Among other things, it will:\n\u2022\nresult in Ally being subject to enhanced oversight and scrutiny as a result of being a BHC with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets (large BHC);\n\u2022\nincrease the levels of capital and liquidity with which Ally must operate and affect how it plans capital and liquidity levels;\n\u2022\nsubject Ally to new and/or higher fees paid to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance fees and any other similar assessments paid by Ally Bank to the FDIC;\n\u2022\npotentially impact a number of Ally\u2019s business and risk management strategies;\n\u2022\npotentially restrict the revenue that Ally generates from certain businesses;\n\u2022\nrequire Ally to provide to the FRB and FDIC an annual plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress;\n\u2022\nsubject Ally to regulation by the CFPB, which has very broad rule-making, examination, and enforcement authorities; and\n\u2022\nsubject derivatives that Ally enters into for hedging, risk management and other purposes to a comprehensive new regulatory regime which, over time, will require central clearing and execution on designated markets or execution facilities for certain standardized derivatives and impose margin, documentation, trade reporting and other new requirements.\nWhile U.S. regulators have finalized many regulations to implement various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, they plan to propose or finalize additional regulations for implementation in the future. In light of the further rulemaking required to fully implement the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the discretion afforded to federal regulators, the full impact of this legislation on Ally, its business strategies, and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for a number of years. In addition, regulations may impact us differently in comparison to other more established financial institutions. However, these impacts are expected to be substantial and some of them are likely to adversely affect Ally and its financial performance. The extent to which Ally can adjust its strategies to offset such adverse impacts also is not knowable at this time.\nFuture consumer legislation or actions could harm our competitive position.\nIn addition to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, various legislative bodies have also recently been considering altering the existing framework governing creditors\u2019 rights, including legislation that would result in or allow loan modifications of various sorts. Such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase the cost of doing business; limit or expand permissible activities; or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any regulations would have on our activities, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOur business may be adversely affected upon our implementation of the revised capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III final rules.\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee reached an agreement on the Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators finalized rules implementing the U.S. Basel III capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Act provisions. The U.S. Basel III final rules represent substantial revisions to the previously effective regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations. Ally became subject to the U.S. Basel III final rules beginning on January 1, 2015. Certain aspects of the U.S. Basel III final rules, including new capital buffers and regulatory capital deductions, will be phased in over several years. The U.S. Basel III final rules subject Ally to higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer above these minimum ratios. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer would result in restrictions on Ally\u2019s ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.\nThe U.S. Basel III final rules will, over time, require more stringent deductions for, among other assets, certain DTAs from Ally\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 capital and limit Ally\u2019s ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements through the use of trust preferred securities, or other \u201chybrid\u201d securities (although certain debt or equity issued to the U.S. government under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act are grandfathered as Tier 1 capital).\nIf we or Ally Bank fail to satisfy regulatory capital requirements, we or Ally Bank may be subject to serious regulatory sanctions ranging in severity from being precluded from making acquisitions or engaging in new activities to becoming subject to informal or formal supervisory actions by the FRB and/or FDIC and, potentially, FDIC receivership of Ally Bank. If any of these were to occur, such actions could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position. To maintain its status as a FHC, Ally and its bank subsidiary, Ally Bank, must remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell-managed,\u201d as defined under applicable law.\nFor the current capital planning and stress testing cycle that began in October 2014, the Dodd-Frank company-run stress tests and FRB supervisory stress tests to which Ally is subject, the annual capital plan that Ally must submit and the FRB\u2019s annual post-stress capital analysis under the CCAR must incorporate the more stringent capital requirements in the U.S. Basel III final rules as they are phased in over the nine-quarter forward-looking planning horizon. Under the FRB\u2019s capital plan rule, an objection to a large BHC's capital plan would prohibit it from paying dividends or making certain other capital distributions.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by governmental fiscal and monetary policies.\nOur business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. The FRB\u2019s policies influence the new and used vehicle financing market, which significantly affects the earnings of our businesses. The FRB\u2019s policies also influence the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\nOur business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the impact of affiliate transaction restrictions imposed in connection with certain financing transactions.\nCertain transactions between Ally Bank and any of its nonbank \u201caffiliates,\u201d including but not limited to Ally Financial Inc. are subject to federal statutory and regulatory restrictions. Pursuant to these restrictions, unless otherwise exempted, \u201ccovered transactions,\u201d including Ally Bank\u2019s extensions of credit to and asset purchases from its nonbank affiliates, generally (1) are limited to 10% of Ally Bank\u2019s capital stock and surplus with respect to transactions with any individual affiliate, with an aggregate limit of 20% of Ally Bank\u2019s capital stock and surplus for all affiliates and all such transactions; (2) in the case of certain credit transactions, are subject to stringent collateralization requirements; (3) in the case of asset purchases by Ally Bank, may not involve the purchase of any asset deemed to be a \u201clow quality asset\u201d under federal banking guidelines; and (4) must be conducted in accordance with safe-and-sound banking practices (collectively, the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions). Furthermore, there is an \u201cattribution rule\u201d that provides that a transaction between Ally Bank and a third party must be treated as a transaction between Ally Bank and a nonbank affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of, or transferred to, a nonbank affiliate of Ally Bank.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, among other changes to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, credit exposures resulting from derivatives transactions, securities lending and borrowing transactions, and acceptance of affiliate-issued debt obligations (other than securities) as collateral for a loan or extension of credit will be treated as \u201ccovered transactions.\u201d The Dodd-Frank Act also expands the scope of covered transactions required to be collateralized and places limits on acceptable collateral.\nThe ability to grow Ally Bank\u2019s business in the future could be affected by the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAlly Financial Inc. may be limited in its ability to receive distributions from its subsidiaries.\nRegulatory and other legal restrictions may limit the ability of Ally Financial Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries to transfer funds freely to Ally Financial Inc. In particular, many of Ally Financial Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to laws, regulations, and rules that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to it or that prohibit such transfers entirely in certain circumstances. These laws, regulations, and rules may hinder Ally Financial Inc.\u2019s ability to access funds that it may need to make payments on its obligations in the future. Furthermore, as a BHC, Ally Financial Inc. may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on its ability to pay dividends. The bank regulators have the authority and, under certain circumstances, the duty to prohibit or to limit payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including Ally Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business and results of operations are highly dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.\nOur business and results of operation are highly sensitive to sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, credit availability, fuel costs, and overall economic conditions. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2008, and did not rebound significantly until 2012-13. Any future declines in new and used vehicle sales could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nThe profitability and financial condition of our operations are heavily dependent upon GM and Chrysler.\nGM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers compose a significant portion of our customer base, and our Dealer Financial Services operations are highly dependent on GM and Chrysler production and sales volume. In 2014, 61% of our U.S. new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 70% of our U.S. new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for GM franchised dealers and customers, and 28% of our U.S. new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 17% of our U.S. new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for Chrysler dealers and customers.\nWe were previously party to separate agreements with both GM and Chrysler that provided for certain exclusivity privileges related to subvention programs that they offered. Our agreement with Chrysler expired in April 2013. In addition, our agreement with GM expired effective February 28, 2014. These agreements, which provided us with certain preferred provider benefits, including limiting the use of other financing providers by GM and Chrysler for their incentive programs, have expired.\nGM informed its dealers in early January 2015 that it intends to provide lease subvention programs for Buick, GMC, and Cadillac products exclusively through its wholly-owned subsidiary, General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GMF). Further, GM informed us on February 27, 2015 that they also intend to provide lease subvention programs for Chevrolet exclusively through GMF. Ally's total originations during 2014 of $41.0 billion included approximately $9.3 billion of GM lease originations and approximately $4.0 billion of GM subvented loan originations. Buick, GMC, Cadillac, and Chevrolet leases combined accounted for approximately 23% of Ally\u2019s total originations during 2014. If we are unable to successfully offset these declines in our business, these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations over time.\nOther automotive manufacturers could utilize other existing companies, including their own captives, to support their financing needs including offering products or terms that we would not or could not offer, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. Furthermore, other automotive manufacturers could expand or establish or acquire captive finance companies to support their financing needs thus reducing their need for our services.\nA significant adverse change in GM\u2019s or Chrysler\u2019s business, including the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the use of GM or Chrysler marketing incentives; GM\u2019s or Chrysler\u2019s relationships with its key suppliers; vehicle recalls; or GM\u2019s or Chrysler\u2019s relationship with the United Auto Workers and other labor unions and other factors impacting GM or Chrysler or their respective employees, or significant adverse changes in their respective liquidity position and access to the capital markets; could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.\nThere is no assurance that the automotive market or GM\u2019s and Chrysler\u2019s respective share of that market will not suffer downturns in the future, and any negative impact could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nOur inability to maintain relationships with dealers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business depends on the continuation of our relationships with our customers, particularly the automotive dealers with whom we do business. While the number of dealers that we have retail relationships with increased during 2014, the number of dealers that we have wholesale relationships with decreased approximately 2% as compared to December 31, 2013. Further, our share of GM commercial wholesale financing decreased from 71% in 2012 to 64% in 2014, and our share of Chrysler commercial wholesale financing decreased from 58% in 2012 to 45% in 2014. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with key automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason, including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis or offer products that meet the needs of the dealers, this trend related to wholesale funding may continue, and the number dealers with which we have retail funding relationships could also decline in the future. As a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected in the future.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOur profitability and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if the residual value of off-lease vehicles decreases in the future.\nVehicle operating leases currently comprise a substantial portion of our consumer financing originations. In particular, our GM lease originations were 23% of our consumer financing originations in 2014. Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent the actual residual value of the vehicle, as reflected in the sales proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination, is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we incur additional depreciation expense and/or a loss on the lease transaction. General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, new vehicle market prices, perceived vehicle quality, overall price, the vehicle disposition channel, and volatility of gasoline or diesel fuel, among other factors, heavily influence used vehicle prices and thus the actual residual value of off-lease vehicles. Further, it is unclear how GM's decision to provide lease subvention programs for Buick, GMC, Cadillac, and Chevrolet exclusively through GMF could impact residual values for GM vehicles. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during 2008, sharp declines in demand and used vehicle sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.\nVehicle brand images, consumer preference, and vehicle manufacturer marketing programs that influence new and used vehicle markets also influence lease residual values. In addition, our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and proceeds realized from the vehicle sales. Differences between the actual residual values realized on leased vehicles and our expectations of such values at contract inception could have a material negative impact on our profitability and financial condition.\nA failure of or interruption in, as well as, security risks of the communications and information systems on which we rely to conduct our business could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe rely heavily upon communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of our information systems or the third-party information systems on which we rely as a result of inadequate or failed processes or systems, human errors, employee misconduct, catastrophic events, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, misplaced or lost data, or other external events could cause underwriting or other delays and could result in fewer applications being received, slower processing of applications, and reduced efficiency in servicing.\nIn addition, our communication and information systems may present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or identity theft. The access by unauthorized persons to personal, confidential or proprietary information in our possession or our proprietary information, software, methodologies, and business secrets could result in a significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products, and services. For example, similar to other large financial institutions, in the past we have been subject to cyber-attacks that briefly resulted in slow performance and unavailability of our website for some customers. Information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and disruption in our funding sources and access to the capital markets would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.\nOur liquidity and the long-term viability of Ally depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully raise capital and secure appropriate bank financing.\nWe have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding in recent years, it continues to remain an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2014, approximately $4.9 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2015, and approximately $1.9 billion and $4.4 billion in principal amount of consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2016 and 2017, respectively. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2014, a total of $3.3 billion in principal amount of Demand Notes were outstanding. We also rely substantially on secured funding. At December 31, 2014, approximately $12.6 billion of outstanding consolidated secured debt is scheduled to mature in 2015, approximately $11.6 billion is scheduled to mature in 2016, and approximately $11.2 billion is scheduled to mature in 2017. Furthermore, at December 31, 2014, approximately $17.1 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2015, which is not included in the 2015 unsecured maturities provided above. Additional financing will be required to fund a material portion of the debt maturities over these periods. The capital markets can be volatile, and Ally\u2019s access to the debt markets may be significantly reduced during periods of market stress.\nAs a result of volatility in the markets, our current unsecured debt ratings, and various other factors, we have increased our reliance on various secured debt markets. Although market conditions have improved, there can be no assurances that this will continue. In addition, we continue to rely on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions and a tightening of credit availability could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nthese facilities and increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While markets have continued to stabilize following the 2008 liquidity crisis, there can be no assurances these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.\nOur indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $74.6 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $47.9 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 25% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, during the twelve months ending December 31, 2014, we declared and paid preferred stock dividends of $268 million in the aggregate.\nWe have the ability to create additional unsecured indebtedness. If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nThe market for automotive financing industry is extremely competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully, if current competitive conditions tighten, or if there is increased competition in the automotive financing and/or insurance markets or generally in the markets for securitizations or asset sales, our business could be negatively affected.\nThe markets for automotive financing, insurance, and banking are highly competitive. We directly compete in the automotive financing market with banks, credit unions, captive automotive finance, and independent finance companies. Our insurance business also faces significant competition from automotive manufacturers, captive automotive finance companies, insurance carriers, third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies. Some of these competitors have certain exclusivity privileges with automotive manufacturing companies whose customers and dealers compose a significant portion of our customer base. In addition, Ally Bank faces significant competition from commercial banks, savings institutions, and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, substantially lower costs of capital, and are much less reliant on securitization activities, unsecured debt, and other public markets. Our competitors may be subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes than we are, thus putting us at a competitive disadvantage to these competitors. We face significant competition in most areas including product offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate, our profitability and financial condition would be negatively affected.\nThe markets for asset securitizations and whole-loan sales are competitive, and other issuers and originators could increase the amount of their issuances and sales. In addition, lenders and other investors within those markets often establish limits on their credit exposure to particular issuers, originators, and asset classes, or they may require higher returns to increase the amount of their exposure. Increased issuance by other participants in the market or decisions by investors to limit their credit exposure to (or to require a higher yield for) us or to automotive securitizations or whole-loans could negatively affect our ability and that of our subsidiaries to price our securitizations and whole-loan sales at attractive rates. The result would be lower proceeds from these activities and lower profits for our subsidiaries and us.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses, which represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans, all as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, accounting rules and related guidance, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, portfolio size, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, our continued expansion of our originations across a broad risk spectrum could increase our allowance for loan losses in the future.\nBank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. An increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nWe are exposed to consumer credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment or performance by customers for our contracts and loans, as well as contracts and loans that are securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. Furthermore, a weak economic environment and high unemployment rates could exert pressure on our consumer automotive finance customers resulting in higher delinquencies, repossessions, and losses. There can be no assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it affects the value of these assets and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through our risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting policies, and loss-mitigation strategies are, or will be, sufficient to prevent a further adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. We have continued to provide nonprime automotive financing. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. In addition, we have increased our used vehicle financing. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. At December 31, 2014, the carrying value of our Automotive Finance operations nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $6.7 billion, or approximately 11.9% of our total consumer automotive loans. Of these loans, $118 million were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with internal loan policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If we continue to grow our nonprime automotive financing loans over time, our credit risk may increase. As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, the credit risk associated with the transaction may be increased.\nGeneral business and economic conditions may significantly and adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\nOur business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in increased short- and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in the debt capital markets, unemployment rates, housing prices, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, or a decline in the strength of national and local economies and other factors that negatively affect household incomes could decrease demand for our financing products and increase financing delinquency and losses on our customer and dealer financing operations. Further, a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices could lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases and negatively affect our automotive finance business. Finally, concerns about the pace of economic growth in the U.S. and elsewhere and uncertainty regarding U.S. fiscal and monetary policies and the federal deficit, have resulted in significant volatility in the financial markets, and could impact our ability to obtain, and the pricing with respect to, funding that is collateralized by affected instruments and obtained through the secured and unsecured markets. As these conditions persist, our business, results of operation, and financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nIf the rate of inflation were to increase, or if the debt capital markets or the economy of the United States were to weaken, or if home prices or new and used vehicle purchases experience declines, we could be significantly and adversely affected, and it could become more expensive for us to conduct our business. For example, business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes, housing prices, and consumer behavior related to our businesses could decrease (1) the demand for our new and used vehicle financing and (2) the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of held-for-investment assets and new and used vehicle loans and retained interests that continue to be held by us, thus further increasing the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans. In addition, the rate of delinquencies, foreclosures, and losses on our loans could be higher during more severe economic slowdowns.\nAny sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures, or losses could further harm our ability to sell our new and used vehicle loans, the prices we receive for our new and used vehicle loans, or the value of our portfolio of mortgage and new and used vehicle loans held-for-investment or retained interests from our securitizations, which could harm our revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Continued adverse business and economic conditions could affect demand for new and used vehicles, housing, the cost of construction, and other related factors that could harm the revenues and profitability of our business.\nActs or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.\nGeopolitical conditions may affect our earnings. Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.\nOur borrowing costs and access to the unsecured debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings.\nThe cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services; Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc.; Fitch, Inc.; and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates our debt. Our current ratings as assigned by each of the respective rating agencies are below investment grade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the unsecured market. Ratings reflect the rating agencies\u2019 opinions of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Future downgrades of our credit ratings would increase borrowing costs and further constrain our access to the unsecured debt markets and, as a result, would negatively affect our business. In addition, downgrades of our credit ratings could increase the possibility of additional terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements as well as impact elements of certain existing secured borrowing arrangements.\nAgency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency\u2019s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency\u2019s rating.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nSignificant indemnification payments or contract, lease, or loan repurchase activity of retail contracts or leases could harm our profitability and financial condition.\nWe have repurchase obligations in our capacity as servicer in securitizations and whole-loan sales. If a servicer breaches a representation, warranty, or servicing covenant with respect to an automotive receivable, the servicer may be required by the servicing provisions to repurchase that asset from the purchaser or otherwise compensate one or more classes of investors for losses caused by the breach. If the frequency at which repurchases of assets or other payments occurs increases substantially from its present rate, the result could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nOur earnings may decrease because of decreases or increases in interest rates.\nWe are subject to risks from decreasing interest rates. A low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of our businesses by compressing net interest margins or reducing the amounts we earn on our investment securities portfolio, thereby reducing our net interest income and other revenues.\nRising interest rates could also have an adverse impact on our business as well. For example, rising interest rates:\n\u2022\nwill increase our cost of funds;\n\u2022\nmay reduce our consumer automotive financing volume by influencing customers to pay cash for, as opposed to financing, vehicle purchases or not to buy new vehicles;\n\u2022\nmay lead to increased consumer delinquencies;\n\u2022\nmay negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease vehicles; and\n\u2022\nwill generally reduce the value of automotive financing loans and contracts and retained interests and fixed income securities held in our investment portfolio.\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with changes in interest rates and could affect our profitability and financial condition as could our failure to comply with hedge accounting principles and interpretations.\nWe employ various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets, liabilities, and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.\nIn addition, hedge accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the application of significant subjective judgments to a body of accounting concepts that is complex.\nWe use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of certain of our assets. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including, among others, retained interests from securitizations of loans and contracts, loans held-for-sale, and other investments, which do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of leased vehicles. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements. For further discussion related to estimates and assumptions, see MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons, including that they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (for example, macro-economic conditions and their impact on our dealers), and that they often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. As a result, our actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. A material difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects.\nFluctuations in valuation of investment securities or significant fluctuations in investment market prices could negatively affect revenues.\nInvestment market prices in general are subject to fluctuation. Consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value and could negatively affect our revenues. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments, national and international events, and general market conditions.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB and the SEC, banking regulators, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.\nRecently, the FASB has proposed new financial accounting standards, and has many active projects underway, that could materially affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition. These proposed standards or projects include the potential for significant changes in the accounting for financial instruments (including loans, and allowance for loan losses) and the accounting for leases, among others. It is possible that any changes, if enacted, could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty.\nAdverse economic conditions or changes in laws in states in which we have customer concentrations may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to consumer loan portfolio concentration in certain states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these and other states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock, and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited.\nWe have no current plans to commence payment of a dividend on our common stock. Our payment of dividends on our common stock in the future will be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend on business conditions, our financial condition, earnings and liquidity, and other factors. Our Series G preferred stock allows dividend payments on our common stock only if 1) our senior guaranteed notes issued on December 31, 2008 are rated investment grade and 2) the payment, together with other dividend payments we made since December 31, 2008, is less than 25% of our cumulative consolidated net income from January 1, 2014 to the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financial statements are available at the time of such dividend payment. In addition, so long as any share of our Series A preferred stock remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution may be declared or paid on our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends have been paid on the Series A preferred stock.\nAny indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing agreements in the future restrict our ability to pay dividends in cash on our common stock, we may be unable to pay dividends in cash on our common stock unless we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those agreements.\nIn addition, under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory \u201csurplus\u201d (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital), or if there is no such surplus, out of our net profits for the then current and/or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.\nAny plans to commence payment of dividends on our common stock in the future would be subject to the FRB\u2019s review and non-objection. Refer to Business - Certain Regulatory Matters - Bank Holding Company and Financial Holding Company Status for additional information. There is no assurance that, upon the FRB\u2019s review of our future capital plans, we would be permitted to make any planned payments of dividends on our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our organizational documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. Our organizational documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nLimiting the liability of our directors, and providing indemnification to our directors and officers; and\n\u2022\nLimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings.\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the company or changes in management.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (generally defined as a stockholder who owns 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under certain circumstances including receipt of prior board approval.\nAny provision of our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a hostile takeover or change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nAn \u201cownership change\u201d could limit our ability to utilize tax losses and credits carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had deferred tax assets of approximately $1.0 billion related to a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward, $157 million related to capital loss carryforwards, $1.7 billion related to foreign tax credits, and $170 million related to other tax credits (collectively, the tax assets). Our ability to use such tax assets to offset future taxable income and reduce future tax liabilities may be significantly limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of Ally\u2019s ownership (by value) of one or more \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). A corporation that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on the utilization of its pre-ownership change tax assets equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax assets arising from an ownership change under Section 382 would depend, in large part, on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change.\nIf we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d, it is possible that our ability to fully utilize our tax assets may be delayed or deferred, and that a significant portion of our tax assets could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income or reduce future tax liabilities.\nOn January 9, 2014, our Board adopted our Tax Asset Protection Plan (the Plan) to help protect these tax assets. The Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.99 percent shareholder; and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.99 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of Ally common stock, subject to certain exceptions. Unless extended, the Plan expires on January 8, 2017.\nIn addition, on January 9, 2014, our Board approved a protective amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Protective Amendment), which is designed to prevent certain transfers of Ally common stock that could result in an \u201cownership change.\u201d The Protective Amendment generally restricts any transfer of Ally common stock that would (i) increase the ownership by any person to 4.99 percent or more of Ally stock then outstanding; or (ii) increase the percentage of Ally stock owned by a Five Percent Stockholder (as defined in the Plan). Unless extended, the Protective Amendment expires on January 8, 2017.\nDespite the intentions of the Plan and the Protective Amendment to deter and prevent an \u201cownership change\u201d, such an event may still occur. In addition, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us, and may discourage open market purchases of Ally common stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for Ally common stock. Accordingly, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to realize a premium over the market price of Ally common stock in connection with any stock transaction.", "PERMNO": 14558, "SIC": 6172, "TIC": "ALLY"}
