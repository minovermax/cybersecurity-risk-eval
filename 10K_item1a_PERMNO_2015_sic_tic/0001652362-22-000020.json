{"cik": "1652362", "company": "Infrastructure & Energy Alternatives, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to IEA\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and constrain liquidity, falling below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, due to multiple factors including seasonality, spending patterns of our customers, adverse weather conditions, supply chain and labor market constraints, inflation and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, and may result in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results are generally reduced in the first quarter of each year due to adverse seasonal weather changes and customer reductions in their expenditures and work order requests towards the end of the calendar year. Additionally, our quarterly operating results may generally fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter because of several factors, including:\n\u2022weather events, including seasonal adverse conditions and natural catastrophes;\n\u2022labor availability and costs;\n\u2022supply chain constraints due to labor shortages, COVID-19 impacts, customs and border control orders, other laws and international sanctions, or other worldwide manufacturing and shipping constraints;\n\u2022constraints on our subcontractors to deliver equipment and services\n\u2022profitability of our products and services, especially in new markets and due to seasonal fluctuations;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets;\n\u2022macroeconomic conditions, both nationally and locally, such as inflation;\n\u2022changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n\u2022expansion to new markets; and\n\u2022fluctuations in commodity prices.\nThe cumulative impact of these factors have impacted our liquidity and financial position in the past. Though we secured access to a significant line of credit in executing our Credit Agreement, there can be no assurances that our liquidity will not be negatively impacted from these factors.\nIn the future, we may require additional funds for operating purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through debt or equity financing. There is no assurance that this additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on reasonable terms. If our liquidity and capital resources were insufficient to meet our working capital requirements or fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems, may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. In the event we are not able to fund our working capital, we will not be able to implement or may be required to delay all or part of our business plan, and our ability to improve our operations, generate positive cash flows from operating activities and expand the business would be materially adversely affected.\nThe future effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing labor market and supply chain pressures are unknown and evolving, and could result in negative effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a constantly evolving situation that has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide. In particular, efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 have led to shutdowns, worker availability constraints, shortages or delays in the global supply chain and related increases in the costs of labor and goods.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect us in a number of other ways, including:\n\u2022Delays in receiving permits resulting in unanticipated changes to construction schedules;\n\u2022Inability to obtain bonding from our sureties due to tightening of credit markets;\n\u2022Inability to properly staff our construction projects due to labor market shortages, quarantines and local ordinances;\n\u2022Inability of customers to timely fund project obligations due to liquidity issues, financial uncertainties, or supply chain disruptions (including supply chain disruptions impacting a significant amount of equipment used in our projects that are sourced from China);\n\u2022Inability of, or delays by, our subcontractors to deliver equipment and services; and\nEach of the foregoing could cause project delays or terminations, force majeure events and prevent the financing of new projects by our customers, which could negatively impact our ability to recognize revenues, bill our customers for current costs or secure future business. There can be no assurances that our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations will not be negatively impacted by the future effects of COVID-19.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs or bans on imports of certain foreign sourced goods, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nA significant amount of equipment used in our projects is sourced, most often by our customers, from China. Current bans on imports of certain goods from China, particularly of polysilicon covered by the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which is a significant input in the production of solar panels, could result in project delays and increased costs to us or our customers. The ban on some imports relating to the production of solar panels, along with tariffs and border controls for materials entering the U.S. from other countries, could make it harder or more costly for our customers to secure products used\nin the construction of our projects until alternative supply chain sources are identified and developed, which may in turn impact our results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of tariffs and import bans.\nOur business may be affected by delays, only some of which may be recovered through claims against project owners, subcontractors, or suppliers, which could increase our costs, reduce profitability and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur projects involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may involve many parties. Delays on a particular project can arise from a number of events involving the customer, third parties and us, including delays in design and engineering; delays or difficulties in obtaining equipment and materials; schedule changes; failures to timely obtain permits or rights-of-way or to meet other regulatory requirements; delays due to epidemics and pandemics (including COVID-19); weather-related delays; and other governmental, market and political events, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe perform work under a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, challenging and hard to reach terrain and difficult site conditions. Some of our contracts require that we assume the risk should actual site conditions vary from those expected, and these projects may be at increased risk for delays.\nDelays may result in the cancellation or deferral of project work (including through a customer and or third party\u2019s assertion of force majeure, or our assertion of force majeure), which could lead to a decline in revenue from lost project work, or, for project deferrals, could cause us to incur costs which are not reimbursable by the customer, and may lead to personnel shortages on other projects scheduled to commence at a later date. In some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay. We may not be able to recover any of such costs. Any such delays or cancellations or errors or other failures to meet customer expectations could result in damage claims substantially in excess of the revenue associated with a project. Delays or cancellations could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts and our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nWe occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs that exceed the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Similarly, we present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers. If we fail to properly document the nature of change orders or claims, or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating a reasonable settlement, we could incur reduced profits, cost overruns or a loss on the project. These types of claims can often occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays, changes from the initial project scope and adverse conditions, which result in additional cost, both direct and indirect, or from project or contract terminations. From time to time, these claims can be the subject of lengthy and costly proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to timely recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial results.\nOur business is subject to physical hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken our financial condition.\nConstruction projects undertaken by us expose our employees to heavy equipment, mechanical failures, transportation accidents, adverse weather conditions and the risk of damage to equipment and property. These hazards can cause personal injuries and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to suspension of operations and large damage claims which could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount we charge for the associated services. In addition, if serious accidents or fatalities occur, or if our safety records were to deteriorate, we may be restricted from bidding on certain work and obtaining new contracts and certain existing contracts could be terminated. Our safety processes and procedures are monitored by various agencies and ratings bureaus and our historical performance has been better than industry averages. There is, however, no guarantee that we can maintain this performance in the future. The occurrence of accidents in our business could result in significant liabilities, employee turnover, increase the costs of our projects, or harm our ability to perform under our contracts or enter into new customer contracts, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nWe are self-insured against certain potential liabilities.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies with respect to employer\u2019s liability, general liability, auto and workers compensation claims, those policies are subject to deductibles or self-insured retention amounts of up to $500,000 per\noccurrence. We are primarily self-insured for all claims that are less than the amount of the applicable deductible/self-insured retention. In addition, for our employees not part of a collective bargaining agreement, we provide employee health care benefit plans. Our health insurance plans have a self-insurance component up to specified deductibles per individual per year.\nOur insurance policies include various coverage requirements, including the requirement to give appropriate notice. If we fail to comply with these requirements, our coverage could be denied.\nProjected losses under our insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends.\nAcquisition activity presents certain risks to our business, operations and financial position, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals contemplated at the time of a transaction.\nWe expect that the acquisitions will be an important part of our long-term growth strategy. Acquisitions are inherently risky and may not be successful. Successful execution following the closing of an acquisition is essential to achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction, but is challenging and may result in expected or unexpected operating or compliance challenges, which may require significant expenditures and a significant amount of our management\u2019s attention. The potential difficulties or risks of integrating an acquired company\u2019s business include:\n\u2022the effect of the acquisition on our financials, strategy, and our reputation;\n\u2022we fail to successfully implement our business plan for the combined business, are unable to obtain the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including synergies or economies of scale or are unable to complete development and/or integration of acquired technologies;\n\u2022the market does not accept the integrated product portfolio, reducing shareholder value;\n\u2022challenges in reconciling business practices, in integrating product development activities, logistics or information technology and other systems or in reconciling accounting issues;\n\u2022retention risk with respect to key customers, suppliers and employees and challenges in retaining, assimilating and training new employees;\n\u2022potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, which could result in unexpected litigation, regulatory exposure, financial contingencies and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022challenges in complying with newly applicable laws and regulations, including obtaining or retaining required approvals, licenses and permits.\nOur acquisitions may also result in the expenditure of available cash and expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. All of the foregoing risks may be magnified as the cost, size or complexity of an acquisition or acquired company increases, or where the acquired company\u2019s products, market or business are materially different from or more immature than ours, or where more than one integration is occurring simultaneously or within a short period of time.\nIn addition, we may require significant financing to complete an acquisition or investment, whether through bank loans, raising of debt, equity offerings, or otherwise. We cannot assure you that such financing options will be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to obtain such necessary financing, it could have an impact on our ability to consummate a substantial acquisition or investment and execute our growth strategy. Alternatively, we may issue a significant number of shares as consideration for an acquisition, which would have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees, we will be unable to operate efficiently, which could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.\nOur business is labor intensive, and some of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover. In addition, given the nature of the highly specialized work we perform, many of our employees are trained in, and possess, specialized technical skills that are necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. At times of low unemployment rates in the areas we serve, including due to general labor market constraints, it can be difficult for us to find qualified and affordable personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain a sufficiently skilled labor force necessary to support\nour operating requirements and growth strategy. Our labor and training expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. We may not be able to pass these expenses on to our customers, which could adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, our business is managed by a number of key executive and operational officers and is dependent upon retaining and recruiting qualified management. Labor shortages, increased labor or training costs, or the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of labor shortage trends.\nThe U.S. wind and solar industries benefit from tax and other economic incentives and political and governmental policies. A significant change in these incentives and policies could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe PTC and Solar ITC programs, discussed in Item 1. Business, provide material incentives to develop wind energy generation facilities and thereby impact the demand for our products and services. While the increased demand for our products and services resulting from the current credits and incentives may continue, the failure of Congress to extend or renew these incentives could significantly delay the development of wind energy generation facilities and the demand for wind turbines, towers and related components. In addition, we cannot assure you that any subsequent extension or renewal of the PTC or Solar ITC programs would be enacted prior to their expiration. Any delay or failure to extend or renew the PTC or Solar ITC programs in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial performance and future development efforts.\nState renewable energy portfolio standards generally require state-regulated electric utilities to supply a certain proportion of electricity from renewable energy sources or devote a certain portion of their plant capacity to renewable energy generation. Typically, utilities comply with such standards by qualifying for renewable energy credits evidencing the share of electricity that was produced from renewable sources. Under many state standards, these renewable energy credits can be unbundled from their associated energy and traded in a market system allowing generators with insufficient credits to meet their applicable state mandate. These standards have spurred significant growth in the wind energy industry and a corresponding increase in the demand for our products. Currently, the majority of states and the District of Columbia have renewable energy portfolio standards in place and certain states have voluntary utility commitments to supply a specific percentage of their electricity from renewable sources. The enactment of renewable energy portfolio standards in additional states or any changes to existing renewable energy portfolio standards, or the enactment of a federal renewable energy portfolio standard or imposition of other greenhouse gas regulations may impact the demand for our products. We cannot assure you that government support for renewable energy will continue. The elimination of, or reduction in, state or federal government policies that support renewable energy could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nMany of our customers are regulated by federal and state government agencies, and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact demand for our services and the profitability of those services.\nMany of our energy customers are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\"), and our utility customers are regulated by state public utility commissions. These agencies could change the way in which they interpret the application of current regulations and/or may impose additional regulations. Interpretative changes or new regulations having an adverse effect on our customers and the profitability of the services they provide could reduce demand for our services, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAny future restrictions or regulations that might be adopted could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs for our customers in the renewable industry, reduced capital spending and/or delays or cancellations of future renewable infrastructure projects, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur fixed priced contracts and federal, state and local government contracts pose inherent risks, including inaccurate estimations of costs associated with the contracts, lack of funding from government sources, onerous terms and competitive bidding processes, all of which could impair our financial performance.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from fixed-price contracts. Under these contracts, we typically set the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that certain costs associated with our performance may be greater than what we estimated. In addition, we enter into contracts for specific projects or jobs that may require the installation or construction of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure system, which are priced on a per unit basis. Profitability will be reduced if actual costs to complete each unit exceed our original estimates.\nRevenues derived from fixed-price contracts that are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over time (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method), measured by the relationship of total cost incurred compared to total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost input method). Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis as the work progresses. If estimated costs to complete the remaining work for the project exceed the expected revenue to be earned, the full amount of any expected loss on the project is recognized in the period the loss is determined. Our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services and our ability to execute in accordance with our plans. A variety of factors affect these costs, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at work sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts, may cause actual project revenue and profits to differ materially from original estimates. If actual costs exceed our estimates, we could have lower margins than anticipated, or losses, which could reduce our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nAdditionally, we derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with federal, state and local governments and their agencies and departments. These contracts are directly affected by changes in governmental spending and availability of adequate funding. Factors that could affect current and future governmental spending include: policy or spending changes implemented by current administrations, departments or other government agencies; governmental shutdowns, failure to pass budget appropriations, continuing funding resolutions or other budgetary decisions; changes, delays or cancellations of government programs or requirements; adoption of new laws or regulations that affect companies providing services; curtailment of the governments\u2019 outsourcing of services to private contractors; or the level of political instability due to war, conflict, epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters.\nContracts with federal, state and local governments and their agencies and departments are often subject to various uncertainties, rules, restrictions, regulations, oversight audits and profit and cost controls. If we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other restriction or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages, withholding or delay of payments to us and criminal and civil penalties. In \u201cqui tam\u201d actions brought by individuals or the government under the U.S. Federal False Claims Act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded. Government contracts may also contain unlimited indemnification obligations. In addition, most of our government clients may modify, delay, curtail, renegotiate or terminate contracts at their convenience any time prior to their completion.\nGovernment contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. Governments and their agencies have increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract. This process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. Moreover, we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. Any of the foregoing events could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAmounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits. Our backlog is subject to cancellation and unexpected adjustments and therefore is an uncertain indicator of future operating results.\nOur backlog consists of the estimated amount of services to be completed from future work on uncompleted contracts or work that has been awarded with final contracts still being negotiated. Most of our contracts are cancelable on short or no advance notice. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation by a customer, or for other reasons, could significantly reduce the future revenue from contracts in backlog. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but we typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog.\nBacklog amounts are determined based on target price estimates that incorporate historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and from communications with our customers. These estimates may prove inaccurate, which could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. In the past, we have occasionally experienced postponements, cancellations and reductions in expected future work due to changes in our customers\u2019 spending plans, as well as on construction projects, due to market volatility, regulatory and other factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers\u2019 requirements or the accuracy of our estimates. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings. In addition, contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable. If our backlog fails to result in the recognition of revenue, our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations and to address violations of or liabilities created under these requirements.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, soil and groundwater contamination, and employee health and safety. We cannot guarantee that we will at all times be in compliance with such laws and regulations and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or with permitting and other requirements, we may be required to pay fines or be subject to other sanctions. Also, certain environmental laws can impose costs of investigating and cleaning up a contaminated site, regardless of fault, upon any one or more of a number of parties, including the current or previous owner or operator of the site. These environmental laws also impose liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at a contaminated site. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of sites and users of disposal sites for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous substances from those sites.\nChanges in existing environmental laws and regulations, or their application, could cause us to incur additional or unexpected costs to achieve or maintain compliance. The assertion of claims relating to on- or off-site contamination, the discovery of previously unknown environmental liabilities, or the imposition of unanticipated investigation or cleanup obligations, could result in potentially significant expenditures to address contamination or resolve claims or liabilities. Such costs and expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a concentrated base of customers and rely on a limited number of\nsuppliers for certain equipment used in our projects. The loss of our significant customers, or reduced demand for our services, or the loss of our significant suppliers could impair our financial performance.\nOur business is concentrated among relatively few customers, and a significant proportion of our services are provided on a project-by-project basis. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer, our revenue could significantly decline if we were to lose a small number of our significant customers, or if a few of our customers elected to perform the work that we provide with in-house teams. In addition, our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be negatively affected if our customers reduce the amount of business they provide to us, or if we complete the required work on non-recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects. Many of the contracts with our largest customers may be canceled on short or no advance notice. Any of these factors could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAdditionally, there are a limited number of available and suitable suppliers for certain equipment used in our projects, including erection cranes. Our ability to secure equipment and the results of our operations, cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted if these suppliers cease operations or our relationships with these suppliers are otherwise cancelled or terminated without notice.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to lawsuits, indemnity or other claims, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of our business. These actions and proceedings may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, environmental liabilities, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, punitive damages and civil penalties or other losses, liquidated damages, consequential damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief. We may also be subject to litigation involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers or other third parties.\nWhen appropriate, we establish reserves for these items that we believe to be adequate in light of current information, legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage, and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to developments. From time to time claims may involve material amounts and novel legal theories, and any insurance we carry may not provide adequate coverage to insulate us from material liabilities for these claims. Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources from the operation of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nCertain of our businesses have employees who are represented by unions and collective bargaining agreements. The use of a unionized workforce and any related obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nCertain of our employees are represented by labor unions and collective bargaining agreements. Although all such collective bargaining agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur despite the terms of these agreements. Strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and cause us to lose business. Additionally, as current agreements expire, the labor unions may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements on terms favorable to their members, or at all, or avoid strikes, lockouts or other labor actions from time to time that may affect their members. Therefore, it cannot be assured that new agreements will be reached with employee labor unions as existing contracts expire, or on desirable terms. Any action against us relating to the union workforce we employ could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022tax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022costs related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and\n\u2022lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on information, communications and data systems in our operations. Systems and information technology interruptions and/or breaches in our data security could adversely affect our ability to operate and our operating results or could result in harm to our reputation.\nWe are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems. From time to time, we may experience system interruptions and delays. Our operations could be interrupted or delayed, or our data security could be breached, if we are unable to add software and hardware, effectively maintain and upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and/or take other steps to improve the efficiency of and protect our systems. In addition, our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, acts of war or terrorism, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions, including breaches by computer hackers and cyber-terrorists. Any of these or other events could cause system interruptions, delays and/or loss of critical data including private data, could delay or prevent operations, including the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results, processing inefficiency, downtime, or could result in the unintentional disclosure of customer or our information, which could adversely affect our operating results, harm our reputation and result in significant costs, fines or litigation. Similar risks could affect our customers and vendors, indirectly affecting us. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nWe have a significant amount of debt. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and debt service requirements. This level of debt, and the covenants and restrictions associated with that debt, could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations;\n\u2022our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which could trigger events of default that could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic investments and other general corporate requirements, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022subjecting us to increased interest expense related to borrowings under our revolving senior secured credit facility;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged;\n\u2022discouraging potential future acquisitions of us by a third party; and\n\u2022preventing us from paying dividends.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations. Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate positive cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Credit Agreement in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, and some of these activities may be on terms that are unfavorable or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations.\nOur Senior Unsecured Notes and Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us that may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might benefit us.\nOur Senior Secured Notes contain restrictions that, among other things prevent or restrict us in certain circumstances from: incurring additional indebtedness; paying dividends or making other restricted payments; making loans and investments; incurring liens; selling assets; entering into affiliate transactions; entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions; entering into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends; and merging, consolidating or amalgamating or selling all or substantially all of our property.\nOur Credit Agreement also contains certain standard financial covenants which, if not complied with, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity. If our results of operations were negatively impacted by unforeseen factors, or impacted to a greater degree than anticipated, we might not be able to maintain compliance with the covenants and restrictions in our Credit Agreement. If we are unable to comply with the financial covenants in the future, and are unable to obtain a waiver or forbearance, it would result in an uncured default under the Credit Agreement, limiting our ability to borrow under it. A default under our Credit Agreement may also be considered a default under certain other of our instruments and contracts, including our Senior Unsecured Notes. If we were unable to borrow under the Credit Agreement, we would need to meet our capital requirements using other sources, if other sources would be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur variable rate indebtedness related to borrowings under our credit facility subjects us to interest rate risk and the transition away from LIBOR could have an adverse impact on us.\nBorrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Additionally, financial markets are in the process of transitioning away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative benchmark rate(s), and such transition is scheduled to be complete by mid-2023. Our Credit Agreement contains LIBOR benchmark replacement provisions. However, at this time, there can be no assurance as to whether any alternative benchmark or resulting interest rates may be more or less favorable than LIBOR or any other unforeseen impacts of the discontinuation of LIBOR. As a result, the proposals or consequences related to this transition could have a material adverse effect on our debt service obligations, financing costs, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and could impair our access to the capital markets.\nThere may be future sales of our common stock or other dilution of our equity, including as a result of the exercise of our warrants, that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We additionally have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of cash for future acquisitions.\nWe may agree to issue additional shares in connection with future acquisition or financing transactions, which could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders\u2019 individual ownership percentages and could lead to volatility in our common stock price. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock. Additionally, we have warrants may result in additional issuances of common stock. See Note 9. Earnings Per Share for further description on each type of warrant and possible dilution. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions, convertible securities or other issuances of our common stock, including restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and/or options, or otherwise, will dilute the ownership interest of our holders of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.\nOur warrant repurchase program may not enhance long-term value and repurchases could increase the price and volatility of our common stock, and diminish our cash reserves.\nOn November 4, 2021, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for the Company\u2019s publicly traded warrants to purchase common stock, which trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol IEAWW. This repurchase program allows the Company to purchase up to $25.0 million of warrants, at prevailing prices, in open market or negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions and other considerations, beginning November 11, 2021, and it will end no later than the expiration of the warrants on March 26, 2023. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases and it may be suspended at any time.\nThe timing and actual number of warrants repurchased depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, available cash, and other market conditions. Warrant repurchases may not enhance shareholder value, as any warrants repurchased could affect the price of our common stock, increase their price volatility and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Additionally, repurchases under this repurchase program will diminish our cash reserves, which impacts our ability to support our operations and pursue possible future opportunities and acquisitions.\nM III and Mohsin Meghji has significant ability to influence corporate decisions.\nMr. Meghji directly and indirectly through M III Sponsor I LLC (\u201cM III Sponsor\u201d) and other entities, has consent rights, pursuant to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of January 23, 2020 (the \"Third A&R Investor Rights Agreement\").

The interests of the Ares Parties, may not align with the interests of our other stockholders. The Ares Parties are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us or may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and certain provision of Delaware law contain anti-takeover provisions that could impair a takeover attempt.\nAs a Delaware corporation, anti-takeover provisions may impose an impediment to the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be of benefit to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, also may impose an impediment or discourage others from a takeover.\nThese provisions include:\n\u2022a staggered board of directors providing for three classes of directors, which limits the ability of a stockholder or group to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by (i) the chairman of our Board, (ii) our Chief Executive Officer, (iii) a majority of our Board, or (iv) directors designated by M III Sponsor subject to certain conditions set forth in the Third A&R Investor Rights Agreement; and\n\u2022the requirement that changes or amendments to certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws must be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of the Common Stock and, in some cases under our Bylaws, 80% of the Common Stock.

During economic downturns, our customers may not have the ability to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure, or may have difficulty obtaining financing for planned projects. In addition, uncertain or adverse economic conditions that create volatility in the credit and equity markets may reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers, causing them to reduce capital spending. This could result in cancellations of projects or deferral of projects to a later date. Such cancellations or deferrals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nIn addition, our customers are negatively affected by economic downturns that decrease the need for their services or the profitability of their services. During an economic downturn, our customers also may not have the ability or desire to continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure or may outsource less work. A decrease in related project work could negatively impact demand for the services we provide and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may reduce our market share and impact our financial performance.\nWe compete with other companies, ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional and national markets. We also face competition from existing and prospective customers that employ in-house personnel to perform some of the services we provide. Most of our customers\u2019 work is awarded through a bid process. Consequently, price is often a principal factor that determines which service provider is selected, especially on smaller, less complex projects. Smaller competitors sometimes win bids for projects due to their lower costs and financial return requirements. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in bidding for projects or renewing our contracts, or if our ability to win such projects or agreements requires that we accept lower margins.", "PERMNO": 16261, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "IEA"}
