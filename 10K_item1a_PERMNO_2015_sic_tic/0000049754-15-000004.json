{"cik": "49754", "company": "DineEquity, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nGeneral\nThis Item 1A includes forward-looking statements. You should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements included in Item 7.\nThe occurrence of any of the events discussed in the following risk factors may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which may materially adversely affect the value of our shares of common stock.\nOur business is affected by general economic conditions that are largely out of our control. Our business is dependent to a significant extent on national, regional and local economic conditions, and, to a lesser extent, on global economic conditions, particularly those conditions affecting the demographics of the guests that frequently patronize Applebee's or IHOP restaurants. If our customers' disposable income available for discretionary spending is reduced (because of circumstances such as job losses, credit constraints, higher housing costs, increased tax rates, energy costs, interest rates or other costs) or if the perceived wealth of customers decreases (because of circumstances such as lower residential real estate values, increased foreclosure rates, increased tax rates or other economic disruptions), our business could experience a decline in sales and/or customer traffic as potential customers choose lower-cost alternatives (such as quick-service restaurants) or choose alternatives to dining out. Any decreases in customer traffic or average value per transaction due to these or other reasons could:\n\u2022\nreduce gross sales at franchise restaurants, resulting in lower royalty and other payments from franchisees,\n\u2022\nreduce the profitability of franchise restaurants, potentially impacting the ability of franchisees to make royalty payments when they are due and to develop new restaurants as may be required in their respective development agreements, and\n\u2022\nnegatively impact the financial performance of our company-operated restaurants.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt. As of December 31, 2014, certain of our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries had approximately $1.3 billion of long-term debt. In addition, we had approximately $0.2 billion in financing and capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2014. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial health. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt or refinance any of our debt on attractive terms, commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders, repurchase shares of our common stock, fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nresult in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our debt or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt documents, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on our assets securing such debt.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nThe terms of the securitized debt issued by certain of our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and the failure to comply with such restrictive terms could put us in default, which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects. Unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt, we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of the securitized debt issued by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. For example, the indenture entered into by such subsidiaries in connection with the securitized debt contains covenants that limit the ability of certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries to, among other things: sell assets; alter the business conducted by such subsidiaries; engage in mergers or acquisitions; declare dividends or redeem or purchase certain equity interests; incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees; make loans and investments; incur liens; and enter into transactions with affiliates other than on an arms-length basis. These covenants are applicable only to the securitization subsidiaries and do not apply to any of DineEquity, Inc., International House of Pancakes, LLC or Applebee\u2019s International, Inc. as these entities are not a party to the indenture. A breach of a covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt.\nFurther, the securitized debt also includes limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and contains a number of financial performance measures that must be met to avoid a possible rapid amortization event or event of default. The most significant of these measures include a minimum debt service coverage ratio and minimum domestic franchise system sales. The ability to meet these financial performance measures can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will satisfy these financial measures.\nIf amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default and we are unable to pay such amounts, the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets, which consist of substantially all of our domestic revenue-generating assets and domestic intellectual property.\nDuring the seven-year term following issuance, the outstanding fixed-rate senior notes will accrue interest at a rate of 4.277% per year. Additionally, the fixed-rate senior notes have scheduled quarterly principal amortization payments of $3.25 million. If we maintain a leverage ratio of less than or equal to 5.25x total debt to EBITDA, we may elect to not make the scheduled principal payments.\nIf we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the seven-year term, our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and, other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling, general and administrative expenses, would not be available for operating our business.\nIn the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the seven-year term), the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.\nNo assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing.\nDeclines in our financial performance could result in impairment charges in future periods. United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) require annual (or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant) impairment tests of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Generally speaking, if the carrying value of the asset is in excess of the estimated fair value of the asset, the carrying value will be adjusted to fair value through an impairment charge. Fair values of goodwill and intangible assets are primarily estimated using discounted cash flows based on five-year forecasts of financial results that incorporate assumptions as to same-restaurant sales trends, future development plans and brand-enhancing initiatives, among other things. Fair values of long-lived tangible assets are primarily estimated using discounted cash flows over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Significant underachievement of forecasted results could reduce the estimated fair value of these assets below the carrying value, requiring non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of the asset. As of December 31, 2014, our total stockholders' equity was $279.1 million. A significant impairment write-down of goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets in the future could result in a deficit balance in stockholders' equity. While such a deficit balance would not create an event of default in any of our contractual agreements, the negative perception of such a deficit could have an adverse effect on our stock price and could impair our ability to obtain new financing, or refinance existing indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nMany factors, including those over which we have no control, affect the trading volatility and price of our stock. Many factors, in addition to our operating results, may have an impact on the trading volatility and price of our common stock. These factors include general economic and market conditions, publicity regarding us, our competitors, or the restaurant industry generally, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, changes in financial or tax reporting and accounting principles or practices, trading activity in our common stock, and the impact of our capital allocation initiatives, including any future stock repurchase programs or dividend declarations. A number of these factors are outside of our control, and any failure to meet market expectations whether for sales growth rates, earnings per share or other metrics could cause our share price to decline.\nOur actual operating and financial results in any given period may differ from guidance we provide to the public, including our most recent public guidance. From time to time, in press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls and other contexts, we have provided guidance to the public regarding current business conditions and our expectations for our future financial results. We expect that we will provide guidance periodically in the future. Our guidance is based upon a number of assumptions, expectations and estimates that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In providing our guidance, we also make various assumptions with respect to our future business decisions, some of which will change. Our actual financial results, therefore, may vary from our guidance due to our inability to meet the assumptions upon which our guidance is based and the impact on our business of the various risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors and in our public filings with the SEC. Variances between our actual results and our guidance may be material. To the extent that our actual financial results do not meet or exceed our guidance, the trading prices of our securities may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business strategy may not achieve anticipated results. We expect to continue to apply a business strategy that includes, among other things, (i) operation of a 99% franchised restaurant system; (ii) the maintenance of a purchasing cooperative that procures products and services for our Applebee's and IHOP restaurants; (iii) the possible introduction of new restaurant concepts; and (iv) the continued implementation of a shared service model across the brands for various functions, including legal, human resources, communications, quality assurance, information technology, finance and centers of excellence in development and operations support. There can be no assurance that the business strategy we apply to one franchise system will be suitable or will achieve results similar to the application of such business strategy to the other franchise system. In addition, our operational improvement, purchasing and other strategic initiatives may not be successful or achieve the desired results. In particular, there can be no assurance that the existing franchisees or prospective new franchisees will respond favorably to such initiatives.\nOur performance is subject to risks associated with the restaurant industry, including the highly competitive nature of the industry. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues in the form of royalties based on a percentage of the gross sales of our franchised restaurants. Sales and profitability of these restaurants and, in turn, payments we receive from our franchisees may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control. The most significant are:\n\u2022\ndeclines in comparable-restaurant sales growth rates due to: (i) failing to meet or adequately adapt to changing customers' expectations for food quality and taste or to innovate new menu items to retain the existing customer base and attract new customers; (ii) competitive intrusions in our markets; (iii) opening new restaurants that cannibalize the sales of existing restaurants; (iv) failure of national or local marketing to be effective; (v) weakening national, regional and local economic conditions; and (vi) natural or man-made disasters or adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nnegative trends in operating expenses such as: (i) increases in food costs including rising commodity costs; (ii) increases in labor costs including increases mandated by minimum wage and other employment laws, immigration reform, the potential impact of union organizing efforts, increases due to tight labor market conditions and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; and (iii) increases in other operating costs including advertising, utilities, lease-related expenses and credit card processing fees;\n\u2022\nthe highly competitive nature of the restaurant industry with respect to, among other things: (i) price, service, location, personnel and the type and quality of food; (ii) the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, as well as the continued expansion of restaurants in the breakfast daypart; and (iii) the entry of major market players in non-competing industries into the food services market which could decrease the market share of Applebee\u2019s and IHOP in their respective categories;\n\u2022\nthe inability to open new restaurants that achieve and sustain acceptable sales volumes;\n\u2022\nthe inability to increase menu pricing to offset increased operating expenses;\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively manage further penetration into mature markets;\n\u2022\nnegative trends in the availability of credit and in expenses such as interest rates and the cost of construction materials that will affect our ability or our franchisees' ability to maintain and refurbish existing restaurants;\n\u2022\nthe inability to manage our company-owned restaurants due to unanticipated changes in, or availability of, qualified restaurant management, staff and other personnel; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to operate effectively in new and/or highly competitive geographic regions or local markets in which we or our franchisees have limited operating experience.\nA lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations. The success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations. As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable. Potential declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations. In addition, desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation. Additionally, restaurant revitalization initiatives may not be completed as and when projected and may not produce the results we expect.\nWe may experience shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of food and other products from third parties or in the availability of utilities. Our franchised and company-operated restaurants are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh produce, food, beverage and other products. This subjects us to the risk of shortages or interruptions in food and beverage supplies which may result from a variety of causes including, but not limited to, shortages due to adverse weather, labor unrest, political unrest, terrorism, outbreaks of food-borne illness, disruption of operation of production facilities, the financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, of our suppliers or other unforeseen circumstances. Such shortages could adversely affect our revenue and profits. The inability to secure adequate and reliable supplies or distribution of food and beverage products could limit our ability to make changes to our core menus or offer promotional \"limited time only\" menu items, which may limit our ability to implement our business strategies. Our restaurants bear risks associated with the timeliness of deliveries by suppliers and distributors as well as the solvency, reputation, labor relationships, freight rates, prices of raw materials and health and safety standards of each supplier and distributor. Other significant risks associated with our suppliers and distributors include improper handling of food and beverage products and/or the adulteration or contamination of such food and beverage products. Disruptions in our relationships with suppliers and distributors may reduce the payments we receive from our franchisees or our pancake and waffle dry mix distributors or the profits generated by our company-operated restaurants. In addition, interruptions to the availability of gas, electric, water or other utilities may adversely affect our operations.\nA failure to develop and implement innovative marketing and guest relationship initiatives, ineffective or improper use of social media or other marketing initiatives, and increased advertising and marketing costs, could adversely affect our business results. If our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results. A failure to sufficiently innovate, develop guest relationship initiatives, or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales.\nAs part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests. These efforts may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues or increased employee engagement. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our brands, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our franchisees, guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation. These efforts may not be successful, and pose a variety of other risks, as discussed below under the heading: \u201cWe are heavily dependent on information technology and any material failure of that technology could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.\u201d\nChanging health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid Applebee's and IHOP's products in favor of alternative foods. The food service industry as a whole rests on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, national and international levels, and the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet, nutrition and health. Our franchise development and system-wide sales depend on the sustained demand for our products, which may be affected by factors we do not control. Various factors such as: (i) the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s menu labeling rules of nutritional content, (ii) nutritional guidelines issued by the United States Department of Agriculture and issuance of similar guidelines or statistical information by state or local municipalities, or (iii) academic studies, may impact consumer choice and cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by Applebee's or IHOP restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt Applebee's or IHOP restaurants' menu offerings to keep pace with developments in consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the franchise payments we receive from franchisees and the revenues generated by our company-operated restaurants.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and vendors in foreign markets. Our expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation. We believe that we have selected high-caliber international franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations. However, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee. If the franchisee does not successfully operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, or customers have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution, our brand values could suffer, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThere is no assurance that our international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue. Our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations, as well as a number of additional risks. These include, among other things, international economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, and differing cultures and consumer preferences.\nWe also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors. These include antitrust and tax requirements, import/export/customs regulations, anti-boycott regulations, and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFactors outside our control may harm our brands' reputations. The success of our restaurant business is largely dependent upon brand recognition and the strength of our franchise systems. The continued success of our franchisees and our company-operated restaurants will be directly dependent upon the maintenance of a favorable public view of the Applebee's and IHOP brands. Negative publicity (e.g., crime, scandal, litigation, on-site accidents and injuries or other harm to customers) at a single Applebee's or IHOP location can have a substantial negative impact on the operations of all restaurants within the Applebee's or IHOP system. Multi-unit food service businesses such as ours can be materially and adversely affected by widespread negative publicity of any type, but particularly regarding food quality, food-borne illness, food tampering, obesity, injury or other health concerns with respect to certain foods, whether or not accurate or valid. The risk of food-borne illness or food tampering cannot be completely eliminated. Any outbreak of food-borne illness or other food-related incidents attributed to Applebee's or IHOP restaurants or within the food service industry or any widespread negative publicity regarding the Applebee's or IHOP brands or the restaurant industry in general could harm our reputation. Although the Company maintains\nliability insurance, and each franchisee is required to maintain liability insurance pursuant to its franchise agreements, a liability claim could injure the reputation of all Applebee's or IHOP restaurants, whether or not it is ultimately successful.\nWe may be subject to litigation and other legal proceedings that could be time consuming, require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. We are involved in lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. There have been a growing number of lawsuits in recent years. There has also been a rise in employment-related lawsuits. From time to time, we have been subject to these types of lawsuits. The cost of defending claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims may harm our business and operating results. In addition, the increasingly regulated business environment may result in a greater number of enforcement actions and private litigation. This could subject us to increased exposure to stockholder lawsuits.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to complaints or litigation from guests alleging illness, injury or other food quality, food safety, health or operational concerns. We and our franchisees are also subject to \"dram shop\" laws in some states pursuant to which we and our franchisees may be subject to liability in connection with personal injuries or property damages incurred in connection with wrongfully serving alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. Although our franchise agreements require our franchisees to defend and indemnify us, we may be named as a defendant and sustain liability in legal proceedings against franchisees under the doctrines of vicarious liability, agency, negligence or otherwise. We may also initiate legal proceedings against franchisees for breach of the terms of their franchise agreements, including underreporting of sales, failure to operate restaurants according to standard operating procedures and payment defaults. Such claims may reduce the ability of our franchisees to make payments to us and the profits generated by our company-operated restaurants. These claims may also reduce the ability of franchisees to enter into new franchise agreements with us.\nThird-party claims with respect to intellectual property assets, if decided against us, may result in competing uses or require adoption of new, non-infringing intellectual property, which may in turn adversely affect sales and revenues. We regard our service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. To protect our restaurants and services from infringement, we rely on contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions; however, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us, or assert claims that our rights in our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property assets are invalid or unenforceable. Any such claims could have a material adverse effect on us or our franchisees if such claims were to be decided against us. If our rights in any intellectual property were invalidated or deemed unenforceable, it could permit competing uses of intellectual property which, in turn, could lead to a decline in restaurant revenues and sales of other branded products and services (if any). If the intellectual property became subject to third-party infringement, misappropriation or other claims, and such claims were decided against us, we may be forced to pay damages, be required to develop or adopt non-infringing intellectual property or be obligated to acquire a license to the intellectual property that is the subject of the asserted claim. There could be significant expenses associated with the defense of any infringement, misappropriation, or other third-party claims.\nOwnership of real property exposes us to potential environmental liabilities. The ownership of real property exposes us to potential environmental liabilities from United States federal, state and local governmental authorities and private lawsuits by individuals or businesses. The potential environmental liabilities in connection with the ownership of real estate are highly uncertain. We currently do not have actual knowledge of any environmental liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on the Company. From time to time, we have experienced some non-material environmental liabilities resulting from environmental issues at our properties. While we are unaware of any material environmental liabilities, it is possible that material environmental liabilities relating to our properties may arise in the future.\nMatters involving employees at company-operated restaurants expose us to potential liability. We are subject to United States federal, state and local employment laws that expose us to potential liability if we are determined to have violated such employment laws. Failure to comply with federal and state labor laws pertaining to minimum wage, overtime pay, meal and rest breaks, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation regulations, citizenship or residency requirements, child labor requirements, sales taxes and other employment-related matters may have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. In addition, employee claims based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination\nmay divert financial and management resources and adversely affect operations. The losses that may be incurred as a result of any violation of such employment laws are difficult to quantify.\nOur failure or the failure of our franchisees to comply with federal, state and local governmental regulations may subject us to losses and harm our brands. We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), along with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters, including tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status. In 2014, the general counsel\u2019s office of the National Labor Relations Board issued complaints naming the McDonald\u2019s Corporation as a joint employer of workers at its franchisees for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. There can be no assurance that other franchisors will not receive similar complaints in the future which may result in legal proceedings based on the actions of its franchisees. We expect increases in payroll expenses as a result of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage, and although such increases are not expected to be material, we cannot assure you that there will not be material increases in the future. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for our restaurants in a particular area or across the United States. Other labor shortages or increased team member turnover could also increase labor costs. In addition, our vendors may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and regulations issued thereto on our business, and to accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations, including those relating to the food safety and inspection and the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages. Disruptions within any government agencies could impact the U.S. food industry which may have an adverse effect on our business. We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to building and zoning requirements. Each of our and our franchisees' restaurants is also subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state, county and/or municipality where the restaurant is located. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses and approvals that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Although we do not, at this time, anticipate any occurring in the future, we cannot assure you that we or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay the opening of restaurants in the future.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, relating to nutritional content and menu labeling. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. In connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain restaurants, we or our franchisees may be required to expend funds to meet federal, state and local and foreign regulations. The inability to obtain or maintain such licenses or publicity resulting from actual or alleged violations of such laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFinally, we are subject to federal regulation and certain state laws which govern the offer and sale of franchises. Many state franchise laws contain provisions that supersede the terms of franchise agreements, including provisions concerning the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Some state franchise laws require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in that state. The failure to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could adversely affect us and the franchisees. Changes in, and the cost of compliance with, government regulations could have a material effect on operations.\nRestaurant development plans under development agreements may not be implemented effectively. We rely on franchisees to develop Applebee's and IHOP restaurants. Restaurant development and the success of restaurants opened by our franchisees involve substantial risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe demand for Applebee\u2019s and IHOP restaurants and the selection of appropriate franchisee candidates;\n\u2022\ncosts of construction, permit issuance and regulatory compliance;\n\u2022\nthe availability of suitable locations and terms for potential development sites, including lease or purchase terms for new locations;\n\u2022\nthe ability of franchisees to fulfill their commitments to build new restaurants in the numbers and the time frames specified in their development agreements;\n\u2022\nthe availability of financing, at acceptable rates and terms, to both franchisees and third-party landlords, for restaurant development and/or implementation of our business strategy through new remodel programs and other operational changes;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining construction permits and in completion of construction;\n\u2022\ndeveloped properties not achieving desired revenue or cash flow levels once opened;\n\u2022\ncompetition for suitable development sites;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental rules, regulations, and interpretations (including interpretations of the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act); and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and business conditions.\nApproximately 99% of our restaurants are owned and operated by our franchisees and, as a result, we are highly dependent upon our franchisees. Nearly all Applebee\u2019s and IHOP restaurants are owned and operated by our franchisees. As a result, we expect to receive less revenue from company restaurant sales and any increase in general and administrative expenses may have a greater proportional impact on our financial condition and business results. While our franchise agreements are designed to maintain brand consistency, the significant percentage of franchised-operated restaurants may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control of the restaurants. These risks include franchisee defaults on their obligations to us arising from financial or other difficulties encountered by them including personal financial risks unrelated to their franchisee activities, such as:\n\u2022\npayments to us or maintenance and improvement obligations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings;\n\u2022\nunwillingness of franchisees to support our marketing programs and strategic initiatives;\n\u2022\ninability to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints;\n\u2022\ninability to meet rent obligations on leases on which we retain contingent liability;\n\u2022\nfailure to operate restaurants in accordance with required standards;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet the criteria for renewing franchise agreements which could have a negative impact on our revenues;\n\u2022\nfailure to report sales information accurately;\n\u2022\nefforts by one or more large franchisees or an organized franchise association to cause poor franchise relations; and\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements subjecting us to potential losses even when we are not legally liable for a franchisee's actions or failure to act.\nAlthough we believe that our current relationships with our franchisees are generally good, there can be no assurance that we will maintain strong franchisee relationships. Our dependence on franchisees could adversely affect us, our reputation and our brands, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConcentration of Applebee's franchised restaurants in a limited number of franchisees subjects us to greater credit risk. As of December 31, 2014, Applebee's franchisees operated 1,847 Applebee's restaurants in the United States, comprising 99% of the total Applebee's restaurants in the United States. Of those restaurants, the ten largest Applebee's franchisees owned 1,286 restaurants, representing 70% of all franchised Applebee's restaurants in the United States. The largest Applebee's franchisee owned 470 restaurants, representing 25% of all franchised Applebee's restaurants in the United States. The concentration of franchised restaurants in a limited number of franchisees subjects us to a potentially higher level of credit risk with respect to such franchisees because their financial obligations to us are greater as compared to those franchisees with fewer restaurants. The risk associated with these franchisees is also greater where franchisees are the sole or dominant franchisee for a particular region of the United States, as is the case for most domestic Applebee's franchised territories. In particular, if any of these franchisees experiences financial or other difficulties, the franchisee may default on its obligations under multiple franchise agreements including payments to us and the maintenance and improvement of its restaurants. If any of these franchisees are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, a bankruptcy court may prevent the termination of the related franchise agreements and development agreements. Any franchisee that is experiencing financial difficulties may also be unable to participate in implementing changes to our business strategy. Any franchisee that owns and operates a significant number of Applebee's restaurants and fails to comply with its other obligations under the franchise agreement, such as those relating to the quality and preparation of food and maintenance of restaurants, could cause significant harm to the Applebee's brand and subject us to claims by consumers even if we are not legally liable for the franchisee's actions or failure to act. Development rights for Applebee's restaurants are also concentrated among a limited number of existing franchisees. If any of these existing franchisees experience financial difficulties, future development of Applebee's restaurants may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to credit risk from our IHOP franchisees operating under our Previous Business Model, and a default by these franchisees may negatively affect our cash flows. Of the 1,472 IHOP restaurants subject to franchise agreements as of December 31, 2014, approximately half operate under the Previous Business Model. The Company was involved in all aspects of the development and financing of the IHOP restaurants established prior to 2003. Under the Previous Business Model, the Company typically identified and leased or purchased the restaurant sites, built and equipped the restaurants and then franchised them to franchisees. In addition, IHOP typically financed as much as 80% of the franchise fee for periods ranging from five to eight years and leased the restaurant and equipment to the franchisee over a 25-year period. Therefore, in addition to franchise fees and royalties, the revenues received from an IHOP franchisee operating under the Previous Business Model include, among other things, lease or sublease rents for the restaurant property building, rent under an equipment lease and interest income from the financing arrangements for the unpaid portion of the franchise fee under the franchise notes. If any of these IHOP franchisees were to default on their payment obligations to us, we may be unable to collect the amounts owed under the building property lease/sublease agreement and our notes and equipment contract receivables, as well as outstanding franchise royalties. The additional amounts owed to us by each of these IHOP franchisees subject us to greater credit risk and defaults by IHOP franchisees operating under our Previous Business Model and may negatively affect our cash flows.\nFranchisees may breach the terms of their franchise agreements in a manner that adversely affects our brands. Franchisees are required to conform to specified product quality standards and other requirements pursuant to their franchise agreements in order to protect our brands and to optimize restaurant performance. However, franchisees may receive through the supply chain or produce sub-standard food or beverage products, which may adversely impact the reputation of our brands. Franchisees may also breach the standards set forth in their respective franchise agreements.\nFranchisees are subject to potential losses that are not covered by insurance that may negatively impact their ability to make payments to us and perform other obligations under franchise agreements. Franchisees may have insufficient insurance coverage to cover all of the potential risks associated with the ownership and operation of their restaurants. A franchisee may have insufficient funds to cover future unanticipated increases in insurance premiums or losses that are not covered by insurance. Certain extraordinary hazards may not be insurable and insurance may not be available (or may be available only at prohibitively expensive rates) with respect to many other risks. Moreover, there is no assurance that any loss incurred will not exceed the limits on the policies obtained, or that claim payments on such policies will be received on a timely basis, or even if obtained on a timely basis, that such payments will prevent losses to such franchisee or enable timely franchise payments. Accordingly, in cases in which a franchisee experiences increased insurance premiums or must pay claims out-of-pocket, the franchisee may not have the funds necessary to make franchise payments to us.\nAn insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding involving a franchisee could prevent the collection of payments or the exercise of rights under the related franchise agreement. An insolvency proceeding involving a franchisee could prevent us from collecting payments or exercising any of our other rights under the related franchise agreement. In particular, the protection of the statutory automatic stay that arises under Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code upon the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding by or against a franchisee would prohibit us from terminating a franchise agreement previously entered into with a franchisee. Furthermore, a franchisee that is subject to bankruptcy proceedings may reject the franchise agreement in which case we would be limited to a general unsecured claim against the franchisee's bankruptcy estate on account of breach-of-contract damages arising from the rejection. Payments previously made to us by a franchisee that is subject to a bankruptcy proceeding also may be recoverable from us on behalf of the franchisee as a preferential transfer under the United States Bankruptcy Code.\nThe number and quality of franchisees is subject to change over time, which may negatively affect our business. Our Applebee's business is highly concentrated in a limited number of franchisees. We cannot guarantee the retention of any, including the top performing, franchisees in the future, or that we will maintain the ability to attract, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of franchisees of the same caliber. The quality of existing franchisee operations may be diminished by factors beyond our control, including franchisees' failure or inability to hire or retain qualified managers and other personnel. Training of managers and other personnel may be inadequate. These and other such negative factors could reduce the franchisee's restaurant revenues, impact payments to us under the franchise agreements and could have a material adverse effect on us. In the case of Applebee's, these negative factors would be magnified by the limited number of existing franchisees.\nIf franchisees and other licensees do not observe the required quality and trademark usage standards, our brands may suffer reputational damage, which could in turn adversely affect our business. We license our intellectual property to our franchisees, product suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, advertisers and other third parties. The franchise agreements and other license agreements require that each franchisee or other licensee use our intellectual property in accordance with established or approved quality control guidelines. However, there can be no assurance that the franchisees or other licensees will use the intellectual property assets in accordance with such guidelines. Franchisee and licensee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the governing franchise agreement or other license agreement may reduce the overall goodwill\nassociated with our brands. Franchisees and other licensees may refer to our intellectual property improperly in communications, resulting in the weakening of the distinctiveness of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the franchisees or other licensees will not take actions that could have a material adverse effect on the Applebee's or IHOP intellectual property.\nIn addition, even if the licensee product suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, or advertisers observe and maintain the quality and integrity of our intellectual property assets in accordance with the relevant license agreement, any product manufactured by such suppliers may be subject to regulatory sanctions and other actions by third parties which can, in turn, negatively impact the perceived quality of our restaurants and the overall goodwill of our brands, regardless of the nature and type of product involved. Any such sanctions or actions could reduce restaurant revenues and corresponding franchise payments to us.\nWe are heavily dependent on information technology and any material failure of that technology could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business. We rely heavily on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, fraudulent manipulation of sales reporting from our restaurants resulting in loss of sales and royalty payments, or a breach in security of these systems could be harmful and cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.\nAs part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests. These efforts may not be successful, and pose a variety of other risks, as discussed above under the heading: \u201cA failure to develop and implement innovative marketing and guest relationship initiatives, ineffective or improper use of social media or other marketing initiatives, and increased advertising and marketing costs, could adversely affect our business results.\u201d\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our employee and business relationships, all of which could subject us to loss and harm our brands. A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information about our customers, franchisees, vendors and employees. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. Three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include (i) exposure of confidential data about our customers, franchisees, vendors and employees, (ii) damage to the reputation of our brands and (iii) damage to our relationship with our franchisees.\nOur use of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements. If our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws and regulations, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation and could disrupt our operations and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of federal and state laws and payment card industry regulations. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations.\nOur inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as an earthquake, tornado or man-made disaster, including terrorism, at our corporate facilities could materially adversely impact our business. Our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our two restaurant support centers. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural or man-made disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled employees and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important\nto our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nRetail brand development initiatives could negatively impact our IHOP brand. Our business expansion into retail product licensing could create new risks to our IHOP brand and reputation. During 2011, IHOP launched a line of premium frozen breakfast entr\u00e9es and pancake syrups in retail outlets. If customers have negative perceptions or experiences with our retail products, our brand value could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFailure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results, affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.\nA change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results. Additionally, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.", "PERMNO": 76732, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "DIN"}
