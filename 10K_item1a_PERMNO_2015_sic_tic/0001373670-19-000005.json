{"cik": "1373670", "company": "Green Brick Partners, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. Any of these risks could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information contained under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to future fluctuations in response to a number of factors beyond our control. In recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company or its performance, and those fluctuations could materially reduce our common stock price. If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and our stock price.\nCertain large stockholders own a significant percentage of our shares and exert significant influence over us. Their interests may not coincide with ours and they may make decisions with which we may disagree.\nGreenlight Capital, Inc. and its affiliates (\u201cGreenlight\u201d) and James R. Brickman own approximately 48% and 4%, respectively, of the voting power of the Company. These large stockholders, acting together, could determine substantially all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a sale or other change of control transaction. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of our company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, these stockholders could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that you would not approve or make decisions with which you may disagree.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid any dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors (\u201cBOD\u201d) and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends or contained in our financing instruments and other considerations that the BOD deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nCertain large stockholders\u2019 shares may be sold into the market in the future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly.\nWe believe that all or a significant portion of our common stock beneficially owned by Greenlight and Mr. Brickman are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws because they were acquired from us on a private, non-registered basis. We have entered into registration rights agreements with each of these parties, however, that give these parties the right to require us to register the resale of their shares under certain circumstances. If these holders sell substantial amounts of these shares, the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nRisks Related to Our Tax Asset and Organizational Structure\nProvisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third-party or may reduce the value of a shareholder\u2019s investment.\nSome provisions in our Charter and bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder may deem to be in his or her best interest. For example, our BOD may determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders. In addition, stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate directors or to propose business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders and may not take action by written consent. The existence of these provisions could also limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nThe homebuilding industry is cyclical. A severe downturn in the industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nThe residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions such as levels of employment, consumer confidence and income, availability of financing for acquisitions, construction and permanent mortgages, interest rate levels, inflation and demand for housing. The U.S. housing market has been negatively impacted by declining consumer confidence, restrictive mortgage standards and large supplies of foreclosures, resales and new homes, among other factors. When combined with a prolonged economic downturn, high unemployment levels, increases in the rate of inflation and uncertainty in the U.S. economy, these conditions have contributed to decreased demand for housing, declining sales prices and increasing pricing pressure. While national data indicates a slowdown in the overall demand for new homes during the year as interest rates have risen, in the event that demand stalls or declines further, we could experience declines in the market value of our inventory and demand for our lots, homes and construction loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.\nReal estate investments are subject to various risks and fluctuations and cycles in value and demand, many of which are beyond our control. Certain events may decrease cash available for operations, as well as the value of our real estate assets. These events include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in international, national or local economic and demographic conditions;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in financial conditions of buyers and sellers of properties, particularly residential homes and land suitable for development of residential homes;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other real estate investors with significant capital, including other real estate operating companies and developers and institutional investment funds;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates, which could adversely affect the ability of homebuyers to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nunanticipated increases in expenses, including, without limitation, insurance costs, development costs, real estate assessments and other taxes and costs of compliance with laws, regulations and governmental policies; and\n\u2022\nchanges in enforcement of laws, regulations and governmental policies, including, without limitation, health, safety, environmental, zoning and tax laws.\nIn addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in a general decline in the purchase of homes or an increased incidence of home order cancellations. If we cannot successfully implement our business strategy, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nFurther, acts of war, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States and any foreign power or acts of terrorism may cause disruption to the U.S. economy, or the local economies of the markets in which we operate, cause shortages of building materials, increase costs associated with obtaining building materials, result in building code changes that could increase costs of construction, affect job growth and consumer confidence or cause economic changes that we cannot anticipate, all of which could reduce demand for our lots, homes and construction loans and adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation or deflation.\nInflation can adversely affect our homebuilding operations by increasing costs of land, financing, materials, labor and construction. While we attempt to pass on cost increases to homebuyers through increased prices, in a weak housing market, we may not be able to offset cost increases with higher selling prices. In addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on housing demand. In a highly inflationary environment, depending on industry and other economic conditions, we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. Moreover, with inflation, the costs of capital increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources could decline. Current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nAlternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation could also cause the value of our inventory to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance, which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes and have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the continued availability and satisfactory performance of subcontractors which, if unavailable, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe conduct our land development and homebuilding operations primarily as a general contractor. Virtually all land development and construction work is performed by unaffiliated third-party subcontractors. As a consequence, the timing and quality of the development of our land and the construction of our homes depends on the availability and skill of our subcontractors. There may not be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third-party subcontractors in the markets in which we operate. In addition, inadequate subcontractor resources could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn recent years, we have experienced labor shortages and increased labor costs. These labor shortages have resulted in higher wages for subcontractors, construction workers frequently moving between jobs for higher pay, increased prices and delays in projects.\nLabor and raw material shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of land development and home construction, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe residential construction industry experiences labor and raw material shortages from time to time, including shortages in qualified tradespeople and supplies such as insulation, drywall, cement, steel and lumber. These labor and raw material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing if any of the regions in which we operate experiences a natural disaster that has a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures. The cost of labor and raw materials may also be adversely affected during periods of shortage or high inflation. Shortages and price increases could cause delays in, and increase our costs of, land development and home construction, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to recruit, retain and develop highly skilled, competent employees may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nKey employees, including management team members at both the corporate and homebuilder subsidiary levels, are fundamental to our ability to obtain, generate and manage opportunities. If any of the management team members were to cease employment with us, our results of operations could suffer. Our ability to retain our management team or to attract suitable replacements should any members of its management team leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key management team members or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. In addition, we do not maintain key person insurance in respect of any member of our named executive officers.\nIn addition, key employees working in the land development, homebuilding and construction industries are highly sought after. Experienced employees in the homebuilding, land acquisition and construction industries are fundamental to our ability to generate, obtain and manage opportunities. In particular, local knowledge and relationships are critical to our ability to source attractive land acquisition opportunities. Failure to attract and retain such personnel or to ensure that their experience and knowledge is not lost when they leave the business through retirement, redundancy or otherwise may adversely affect the standards of our service and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to acquire undeveloped land, partially-finished developed lots and finished lots suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices, in accordance with our land investment criteria.\nThe homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land and the risk inherent in purchasing and developing land is directly impacted by changes in consumer demand for housing. The availability of finished and partially-finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our investment criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers, inflation in land prices, zoning, allowable housing density, the ability to obtain building permits and other regulatory requirements. Should suitable land or lots become more difficult to locate or obtain, the number of lots we may be able to develop and sell could decrease, the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could increase, perhaps substantially, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs competition for suitable land increases, the cost of acquiring both finished and undeveloped lots and the cost of developing owned land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline, which could adversely impact our financial results. The availability of suitable land assets could also affect the success of our land acquisition strategy, which may impact our ability to increase the number of active selling communities, to grow our revenues and margins and to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf we are unable to develop communities successfully or within expected timeframes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBefore a community generates any revenue, time and material expenditures are required to acquire and prepare land, entitle and finish lots, obtain development approvals, pay taxes and construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model homes and sales facilities. It can take several years from the time that we acquire control of a property to the time that we make our first home sale on the site. Delays in the development of communities expose us to the risk of changes in market conditions for homes. A decline in our ability to develop and market our communities successfully and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and on our ability to service our debt and to meet our working capital requirements.\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties for reasonable prices in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited and we may be forced to hold non-income producing properties for extended periods of time.\nReal estate investments are relatively difficult to sell quickly. As a result, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited and we may be forced to hold non-income producing assets for an extended period of time. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms that we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.\nWe depend on the success of our controlled builders.\nWe participate in the homebuilding business through subsidiaries, which we refer to as our \u201ccontrolled builders.\u201d We are able to exercise control over the operations of each controlled builder. We have entered into arrangements with these controlled builders in order to take advantage of their local knowledge and relationships, acquire attractive land positions and brand images, manage our risk profile and leverage our capital base. Even though the co-investors in our controlled builders are subject to certain non-competition provisions, the viability of our participation in the homebuilding business depends on our ability to maintain good relationships with our controlled builders. Our controlled builders are focused on maximizing the value of their operations and working with a partner that can help them be successful. The effectiveness of our management, the value of our expertise and the rapport we maintain with our controlled builders are important factors for new builders considering doing business with us and may affect our ability to attract homebuyers, subcontractors, employees or others upon whom our business, financial condition and results of operations ultimately depend. Further, our relationships with our controlled builders generate additional business opportunities that support our growth. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our controlled builders, we may be unable to fully take advantage of existing agreements or expand our relationships with these controlled builders. Additionally, our opportunities for pursuing acquisitions of additional builders may be adversely impacted.\nIn Dallas and Atlanta, we sell lots to our controlled builders for their homebuilding operations and provide them loans to finance home construction. If our controlled builders fail to successfully execute their business strategies for any reason, they may be unable to purchase lots from us, repay outstanding construction finance loans made by us or borrow from us in the future, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur controlled builders\u2019 interests may not be wholly aligned with ours or those of our investors.\nOur controlled builders are separate and distinct entities from us. Even though we are able to exercise control over the operations of these entities, the officers of our controlled builders are primarily focused on maximizing the value of the controlled builders\u2019 operations rather than our operations, which could influence their business decisions, including but not limited to decision-making which they believe to be in their best interests. As a result of the foregoing, their business interests may not be fully aligned with ours and those of our investors, which could lead to actions and results that are not in our, or in our investors\u2019, best interests.\nIf we are required to either repurchase or sell a substantial portion of the equity interest in our controlled homebuilding subsidiaries, our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe operating agreements governing our controlled builders contain buy-sell provisions that may be triggered in certain circumstances. In the event that a buy-sell event occurs, our builder will have the right to initiate a buy-sell process, which may happen at an inconvenient time for us. In the event the buy-sell provisions are exercised at a time when we lack sufficient capital to purchase the remaining equity interest, we may elect to sell our equity interest in the entity. If we are forced to sell our equity interest, we will no longer benefit from the future operations of the applicable entity. If a buy-sell provision is exercised and we elect to purchase the interest in an entity that we do not already own, we may be obligated to expend significant capital in order to complete such acquisition, which may result in our being unable to pursue other investments or opportunities. If either of these events occurs, our revenue and net income could decline or we may not have sufficient capital necessary to implement our growth strategy.\nOur geographic concentration could materially and adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in our current markets should decline.\nIn Dallas, we principally operate in the counties of Dallas, Collin and Denton. In Atlanta, we principally operate in the counties of Fulton, Gwinnett, Cobb, Forsyth, Cherokee and Dekalb. In Florida, we principally operate in the counties of Indian River and St. Lucie. To the extent housing demand and population growth slow in our core markets, our favorable growth outlook may not be realized. Furthermore, we may be unable to compete effectively with the resale home market in our core markets. Because our operations are concentrated in these areas, a prolonged economic downturn in one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and a disproportionately greater impact on us than other homebuilders with more diversified operations. Further, slower rates of population growth or population declines in the Dallas, Atlanta or Vero Beach markets, especially as compared to the high population growth rates in prior years, could affect the demand for housing, causing home prices in these markets to decline and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur developments are subject to government regulation, which could cause us to incur significant liabilities or restrict our business activities.\nOur developments are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number and type of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not yet entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or \u201cslow-growth\u201d or \u201cno-growth\u201d initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development and service fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development. As a result, lot and home sales could decline and costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the market value of our land or homes declines, our profits would decrease.\nThe market value of land, building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions, and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values. We acquire land for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets, and may in the future acquire land for expansion into new markets. If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory, we may not be able to generate profits consistent with those we have generated in the past and we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell lots and homes. When market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating, option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable, at which time we may elect to forgo deposits and pre-acquisition costs and terminate such arrangements. In the face of adverse market conditions, we may have substantially higher inventory carrying costs, may have to write down our inventory as a result of impairment and/or may have to sell land or homes at a loss. Any material write-downs of assets, or sales at a loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe terms and availability of mortgage financing can affect consumer demand for homes and the ability of homebuyers to complete the purchase of a home. Because most of our homebuyers, and the homebuyers of those third-party entities to whom we sell lots, finance the purchase of their homes, unfavorable terms in, or the unavailability of, mortgage financing could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur business depends on the ability of our homebuyers, as well as the ability of those who buy homes from the third-party homebuilding entities to which we sell lots (our \u201chomebuilding customers\u201d), to obtain financing for the purchase of their homes. Many of these homebuyers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us or our homebuilding customers. Periodically, lenders, investors, regulators and other third parties may question the adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for various loan programs available to borrowers. This may lead to tightened credit requirements and an increase in indemnity claims for mortgages, as has occurred in the past. Fewer loan products and tighter loan qualifications, in turn, may make it more difficult for a borrower to finance the purchase of a home. If potential buyers of our or our homebuilding customers\u2019 homes, or the buyers of those potential buyers\u2019 existing homes, cannot obtain suitable financing, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nInterest rate increases or changes in federal lending programs or other regulations could lower demand for our lots, homes and construction finance loans, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRising interest rates, decreased availability of mortgage financing or of certain mortgage programs, higher down payment requirements or increased monthly mortgage costs may lead to reduced demand for our homes, lots and construction loans. Increased interest rates can also hinder our ability to realize our backlog because certain of our home purchase contracts provide homebuyers with a financing contingency. Financing contingencies allow homebuyers to cancel their home purchase contracts in the event that they cannot arrange for adequate financing. As a result, rising interest rates can decrease our home sales and mortgage originations. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the federal government has a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its conservatorship of Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d), both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, and its insurance of mortgages originated by lenders through the Federal Housing Administration (the \u201cFHA\u201d) and the Veterans Administration (\u201cVA\u201d). The availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including consumer interest rates for such loans, could be adversely affected by a curtailment or cessation of the federal government\u2019s mortgage-related programs or policies. The FHA may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards, raise minimum down payment requirements, impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs and/or limit the number of mortgages it insures. Due to growing federal budget deficits, the U.S. Treasury may not be able to continue supporting the mortgage-related activities of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA and the VA at present levels, or it may revise significantly the federal government\u2019s participation in and support of the residential mortgage market. Because the availability of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA- and VA-backed mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing and selling many of our homes, any limitations, restrictions or changes in the availability of such government-backed financing could reduce our home sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which LIBOR rates are determined and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.\nThe United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) has recently announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 (the \u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Following the implementation of any reforms to LIBOR or the methods pursuant to which LIBOR rates are determined, or other benchmark rates that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, the manner of administration of such benchmarks may change, with the result that such benchmarks may perform differently than in the past, such benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. Under our Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, LIBOR may be used to set the fluctuating interest rate (the \u201cBase Rate\u201d) and the interest rate for any Eurodollar Rate Advance. If LIBOR is phased out, we may be required to renegotiate with our lender to establish a new interest rate (the \u201cLIBOR Successor Rate\u201d). We can give no assurance that we and our lender will be able to agree on a LIBOR Successor Rate. If we and our lender cannot agree on a LIBOR Successor Rate, our ability to draw upon the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility may be materially impacted.\nAny increase in unemployment or underemployment may lead to an increase in the number of loan delinquencies and property repossessions, which would have an adverse impact on our business.\nPeople who are not employed, are underemployed, who have left the labor force or are concerned about the loss of their jobs are less likely to purchase new homes, may be forced to try to sell the homes they own and may face difficulties in making required mortgage payments. Therefore, any increase in unemployment or underemployment may lead to an increase in the number of loan delinquencies and property repossessions and have an adverse impact on our business both by reducing demand for our homes, lots and construction loans and by increasing the supply of homes for sale.\nAny limitation on, or reduction or elimination of, tax benefits associated with owning a home would have an adverse effect on the demand for our homes, lots and construction loans, which could be material to our business.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act made major changes to the Internal Revenue Code that, in part, may affect demand for new homes. Among the possible changes that could make purchasing homes less attractive are (i) limitations on the ability of homebuyers to deduct property taxes, (ii) limitations on the ability of homebuyers to deduct mortgage interest, and (iii) limitations on the ability of homebuyers to deduct state and local income taxes. Due to such changes, the after-tax cost of owning a new home has increased for many of our potential homebuyers and the potential homebuyers of our homebuilding customers.\nThe occurrence of severe weather or natural disasters could increase our operating expenses and reduce our revenues and cash flows.\nThe climates and geology of the states in which we operate present increased risks of severe weather and natural disasters. The occurrence of severe weather conditions or natural disasters can delay new home deliveries and lot development, reduce the availability of materials and/or negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas.\nFurther, to the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, wildfires or other natural disasters or similar events occur, our homes under construction or our lots under development could be damaged or destroyed, which may result in losses exceeding our insurance coverage. Any of these events could increase our operating expenses, impair our cash flows and reduce our revenues.\nHigh cancellation rates may negatively impact our business.\nOur backlog reflects the number and value of homes for which we have entered into non-contingent sales contracts with homebuyers but not yet delivered. Although these sales contracts require a cash deposit, a homebuyer may in certain circumstances cancel the contract and receive a complete or partial refund of the deposit as a result of contract provisions. If home prices decline, the national or local homebuilding environment or general economy weakens, our neighboring competitors reduce their sales prices (or increase their sales incentives), interest rates increase or the availability of mortgage financing tightens, homebuyers may have an incentive to cancel their contracts with us, even where they might be entitled to no refund or only a partial refund. Significant cancellations could have a material adverse effect on our business as a result of lost sales revenue and the accumulation of unsold housing inventory.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against competitors in the homebuilding, land development and financial services industries.\nCompetition in the land development and homebuilding industries is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry. Land developers and homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels for development and resale or homebuilding (or make such acquisitions more expensive), hinder our market share expansion and lead to pricing pressures that adversely impact our margins and revenues. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products. Furthermore, a number of our primary competitors are significantly larger, have a longer operating history and may have greater resources or lower cost of capital than us. Accordingly, competitors may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate. Our homebuilding business also competes for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.\nOur construction financing business competes with other lenders, including national, regional and local banks and other financial institutions, some of which have greater access to capital or different lending criteria and may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential homebuyers.\nAny strategic investments, joint ventures, and/or partnerships that we enter into in which we do not have a controlling interest could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority or conflicts of interest or disputes between us and our partners or co-venturers.\nWe co-invest and in the future may continue to co-invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, acquiring interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of such entities, including homebuilding, land acquisition and/or community development. If we do not have a controlling interest in these entities, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding their activities, and our investment may be illiquid due to our lack of control. Partners or co-venturers may have different economic, financial and industry positions from us which could influence their business decisions, including but not limited to strategic decision-making which they believe to be in their best interests. As a result of the foregoing, their business interests and strategies may conflict with or not be fully aligned with ours and those of our investors, which could lead to actions and results that are not in our, or in our investors\u2019, best interests. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our partners or co-venturers.\nOur future growth may include additional strategic investments, joint ventures, partnerships and/or acquisitions of companies that may not be as successful as we anticipate and could disrupt our ongoing businesses and adversely affect our operations.\nOur investments in our homebuilding subsidiaries have contributed to our historical growth and similar investments may be a component of our growth strategy in the future. We may make additional strategic investments, enter into new joint venture or partnership arrangements or acquire businesses, some of which may be significant. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, significant start-up costs, insufficient revenues to offset expenses associated with these new investments and inadequate return of capital on these investments, any of which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to successfully identify and manage future investments, joint ventures, partnerships or acquisitions could harm our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain suitable bonding for the development of our housing projects.\nWe are periodically required to provide bonds to governmental authorities and others to ensure the completion of our projects. Depending on market conditions, surety providers may be reluctant to issue new bonds and may request credit enhancements (such as cash deposits or letters of credit) in order to maintain existing bonds or to issue new bonds. If we are unable to obtain required bonds for our future projects, or if we are required to provide credit enhancements with respect to our current or future bonds, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDifficulty in obtaining sufficient capital could result in an inability to acquire land for our developments or increased costs and delays in the completion of development projects.\nThe homebuilding industry is capital-intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land parcels and begin development. Land acquisition, development and construction activities may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of financing or the unwillingness of third parties to engage in partnerships, joint ventures or other alternative arrangements.\nWe currently have access to a senior secured revolving credit facility and a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We cannot ensure that we will be able to extend the maturity of these credit facilities or arrange another facility on acceptable terms or at all.\nFurthermore, in the future, we may seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources, including additional bank financings and/or securities offerings. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for land acquisition and construction financing, may be greatly reduced nationally, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. The credit and capital markets are subject to volatility. If we are required to seek additional financing to fund our operations, volatility in these markets may restrict our flexibility to access such financing. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures, we may be unable to acquire land for our housing developments and/or to develop the housing. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital for planned\ndevelopment expenditures could also cause project delays and any such delay could result in cost increases. Any one or more of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may increase our costs, limit the areas in which we can build homes and develop land and delay completion of our projects.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding or development site vary according to multiple factors, including the site\u2019s location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding and land development activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders\u2019 compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to comply strictly with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to our business may increase our costs. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders and land developers in the future.\nUnder various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including for bodily injury, and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nBuilding sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the land development and homebuilding industries poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements, health and safety performance is critical to the success of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities and our ability to attract employees, subcontractors and homebuyers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPoor relations with the residents of our communities, or with local real estate agents, could negatively impact our home sales, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.\nResidents of communities we develop rely on us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities. Efforts made by us to resolve these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation. In addition, we could be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes or to modify community development plans, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nMost of our potential homebuyers engage local real estate agents who are unaffiliated with us in connection with their search for a new home. If we do not maintain good relations with, and a good reputation among, these real estate agents, the agents may not encourage potential homebuyers to consider, or may actively discourage homebuyers from considering, our communities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe use information technology and other computer resources to carry out operational and marketing activities, as well as to maintain our business records, including information provided by our homebuyers. Many of these resources are provided to us and/or maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify certain security and service level standards. Our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if these resources are compromised, degraded, damaged or fail, whether due to a virus or other harmful circumstance, intentional penetration or disruption of our information technology resources by a third-party, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption or failure or error (including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions (including the failure to follow our security protocols) or\nlost connectivity to networked resources. A significant and extended disruption in the functioning of these resources could damage our reputation and cause us to lose homebuyers, sales and revenue.\nProduct liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high. This coverage may be restricted and become more costly in the future. If the limits or coverages of our current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or we are not able to obtain adequate, or reasonably priced, insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, we may experience losses that could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, so our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate.\nThe homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly results of operations and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes five to nine months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders convert to home deliveries. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occurs during the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although we may also be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.\nAdditionally, weather-related problems may occur, delaying starts or closings or increasing costs and reducing profitability. In addition, delays in opening new communities or new sections of existing communities could have an adverse impact on home sales and revenues. Expenses are not incurred and recognized evenly throughout the year. Because of these factors, our quarterly results of operations may be uneven and may be marked by lower revenues and earnings in some quarters compared with others.\nUtility and resource shortages or interest rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe markets in which we operate may in the future be subject to utility or other resource shortages, including significant changes to the availability of electricity and water. Shortages of natural resources in our markets, particularly of water, may make it more difficult for us to obtain regulatory approval of new developments. We may experience material fluctuations in utility and resource costs across our markets, and we may incur additional costs and may not be able to complete construction on a timely basis if such fluctuations arise. Our lumber inventory is particularly sensitive to these shortages. Furthermore, these shortages and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate, which may reduce demand for our homes, lots and construction loans and negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by the failure of persons who act on our behalf to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines.\nAlthough we expect all of our employees, officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, there may be instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business engage in practices that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines. Should we learn of practices relating to homes we build, lots we develop or financing we provide that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we would move actively to stop the non-complying practices as soon as possible and would take disciplinary action with regard to employees who were aware of the practices and did not take steps to address them, including in some instances terminating their employment. However, regardless of the steps we take after we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we can in some instances be subject to fines or other governmental penalties, and our reputation can be injured, due to the practices having taken place.\nWe may become subject to litigation, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn the future, we may become subject to litigation, including claims relating to our operations and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. We generally intend to vigorously defend ourselves. However, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Resolution of these types of matters may result in us having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby materially and adversely\naffecting our business. Certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of our insurance coverage, which could materially and adversely impact our business, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and materially and adversely impact our ability to attract directors or officers.\nWe may suffer uninsured losses or suffer material losses in excess of insurance limits.\nWe could suffer physical damage to property or incur liabilities resulting in losses that may not be fully recoverable by insurance. In addition, certain types of risks, such as personal injury claims, may be, or may become in the future, either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may not be currently or in the future covered by our insurance policies or otherwise be subject to significant deductibles or limits. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur or be subject to deductibles, we could sustain financial loss or lose capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future income from that property. In addition, we could be liable to repair damage or meet liabilities caused by risks that are uninsured or subject to deductibles. We may be liable for any debt or other financial obligations related to affected property. Material losses or liabilities in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future.\nLaws and regulations governing the residential mortgage industry could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn 2018, we established a joint venture, Green Brick Mortgage, to provide mortgage related services to homebuyers. The residential mortgage lending industry remains under intense scrutiny and is heavily regulated at the federal, state and local levels. Although we do not originate mortgages, we are directly or indirectly subject to certain of these regulations. Changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations could require our joint venture to incur significant compliance costs. A material failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in the loss or suspension of required licenses or other approvals, the imposition of monetary penalties, and restitution awards or other relief. Any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe ongoing requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (as amended, the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements has been and will continue to be time-consuming and may result in increased costs and could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we may need to commit significant resources and hire additional staff and provide additional management oversight. Sustaining our growth may require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join us and to maintain appropriate operations and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 92089, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "GRBK"}
