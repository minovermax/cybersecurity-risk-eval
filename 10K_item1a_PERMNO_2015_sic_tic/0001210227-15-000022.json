{"cik": "1210227", "company": "BNC BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related To Our Company, Our Business, and Our Industry\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nThe Bank's results from operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve include open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, particularly in light of the continuing threat of terrorist attacks and the current military operations and other instances of unrest in the Middle East, we cannot predict with certainty possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or our business and earnings. Furthermore, the actions of the U.S. government and other governments in responding to such terrorist attacks or events in the Middle East may result in currency fluctuations, exchange controls, market disruption and other adverse effects.\nOur revenues are highly correlated to market interest rates.\nOur assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature, and as a result, we are subject to significant risks tied to changes in interest rates. Our ability to operate profitably is largely dependent upon net interest income. In 2014, net interest income made up 85% of our recurring revenue. Unexpected movement in interest rates, that may or may not change the slope of the current yield curve, could cause our net interest margins to decrease, subsequently decreasing net interest income. In addition, such changes could materially adversely affect the valuation of our assets and liabilities.\nAs with most financial institutions, our results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates and our ability to manage this risk. The difference between interest rates charged on interest-earning assets and interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities may be affected by changes in market interest rates, changes in relationships between interest rate indices, and changes in the relationships between long-term and short-term market interest rates. In addition, the mix of assets and liabilities could change as varying levels of market interest rates might present our customer base with more attractive options.\nCertain changes in interest rates, inflation, deflation or the financial markets could affect demand for our products and our ability to deliver products efficiently.\nLoan originations, and potentially loan revenues, could be materially adversely impacted by sharply rising interest rates. Conversely, sharply falling rates could increase prepayments within our securities portfolio lowering interest earnings from those investments. An unanticipated increase in inflation could cause our operating costs related to salaries and benefits, technology and supplies to increase at a faster pace than revenues.\nThe fair market value of our securities portfolio and the investment income from these securities also fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.\nOur concentration of real estate loans subjects the Bank to risks that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe deterioration in residential and commercial construction and development and acquisition portfolios may lead to increased nonperforming assets in our loan portfolio and increased provision for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile recent economic data suggests that overall economic conditions are improving, such improvement may be slower in our market areas and if market conditions in the residential construction and development and land acquisition real estate markets remain poor or further deteriorate, they may lead to additional valuation adjustments on our loans and real estate owned in these markets. Furthermore, a sustained weakened economy could result in a continuation of the decreased demand for residential housing, which, in turn, could adversely affect the development and construction efforts of residential real estate developers, adversely affect the ability of those developers to repay their loans and decrease the value of the property used as collateral, resulting in higher levels of non-performing loans. Any further increase in our non-performing assets and related increases in our provision for loan losses could negatively affect our business and have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank, as a lender, is exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our credit risk with respect to our real estate and construction loan portfolio will relate principally to the creditworthiness of business entities and the value of the real estate serving as security for the repayment of loans. Our credit risk with respect to our commercial and consumer loan portfolio will relate principally to the general creditworthiness of businesses and individuals within our local markets.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for estimated loan losses based on a number of factors. If our assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses. We may have to increase our allowance in the future in response to the request of one of our primary banking regulators, to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions, or as a result of any deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot be determined at this time and may vary from the amounts of past provisions.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings and other sources, could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could negatively impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of an economic downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, adverse regulatory action against us, or our inability to attract and retain deposits. Our ability to borrow could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us or our region, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the unstable credit markets.\nOur business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a geographically concentrated part of the United States.\nUnlike larger organizations that are more geographically diversified, our banking offices are primarily concentrated in select markets in North and South Carolina. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. Deterioration in economic conditions in the markets we serve could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nan increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022\nan increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for our products and services; and\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage.\nWe rely on dividends from BNC for most of our revenue.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from BNC. We receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from BNC. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on common stock and interest and principal on our debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that BNC may pay to us. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event BNC is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal and state entities.\nWe are subject to the regulations of the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the NCCOB. New regulations issued by these agencies may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business activities. We are subject to various federal and state laws and certain changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations. Noncompliance with certain of these regulations may impact our business plans, including our ability to branch, offer certain products or execute existing or planned business strategies.\nWe are also subject to the accounting rules and regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Changes in accounting rules could materially adversely affect the reported financial statements or our results of operations and may also require extraordinary efforts or additional costs to implement. Any of these laws or regulations may be modified or changed from time to time, and we cannot be assured that such modifications or changes will not adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to industry competition which may have an impact upon our success.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive financial services environment. Certain competitors are larger and may have more resources than we do. We face competition in our regional market areas from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, internet banks, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services. Some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us or our bank subsidiary and may have greater flexibility in competing for business.\nAnother competitive factor is that the financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to use technology competitively to provide products and services that offer convenience to customers and create additional efficiencies in our operations.\nConsumers may decide not to use local banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete, through alternative methods, financial transactions that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as local bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds with an internet-only bank, or with virtually any bank in the country through on-line banking. Consumers can also complete transactions such as purchasing goods and services, paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower-cost deposits as a source of funds could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur recent results may not be indicative of our future results.\nWe may not be able to grow our business at the same rate of growth achieved in recent years or even grow our business at all. Additionally, we may not have the benefit of several factors that have been favorable to our business in past years, such as an interest rate environment where changes in rates occur at a relatively orderly and modest pace, the ability to find suitable expansion opportunities, or otherwise to capitalize on opportunities presented, or other factors and conditions. Numerous factors, such as weakening or deteriorating economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations, and competition may impede or restrict our ability to expand our market presence and could adversely impact our future operating results.\nWe depend on key personnel for our success.\nOur operating results and ability to adequately manage our growth and minimize loan losses is highly dependent on the services, managerial abilities and performance of our current executive officers and other key personnel. We have an experienced management team that the board of directors believes is capable of managing and growing the Company. Losses of or changes in our current executive officers or other key personnel and their responsibilities may disrupt our business and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, our ability to retain our current executive officers and other key personnel may be further impacted by existing and proposed legislation and regulations affecting the financial services industry. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current executive officers or other key personnel.\nWe may need to rely on the financial markets to provide needed capital.\nOur common stock is listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Although we anticipate that our capital resources will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our capital requirements, at times we may depend on the liquidity of the NASDAQ market to raise equity capital. If the market should fail to operate, or if conditions in the capital markets are adverse, we may be constrained in raising capital. Downgrades in the opinions of the analysts that follow us may cause our stock price to fall and significantly limit our ability to access the markets for additional capital requirements. Should these risks materialize, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth or acquisition may be limited.\nWe face risks related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure.\nThe Bank's ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure while we expand. Similar to other large corporations, in our case, operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or outside persons and exposure to external events. We are dependent on our operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use both to interface with our customers and to manage our internal financial and other systems. Our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new customers depends in part on the functionality of our technology systems. Additionally, our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on these infrastructures.\nWe continuously monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements when we believe it will be cost effective to do so. In some instances, we may build and maintain these capabilities ourselves. We also outsource some of these functions to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. We also face risk from the integration of new infrastructure platforms and/or new third party providers of such platforms into our existing businesses.\nFinancial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that\ninformation. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions with which we do business could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including counterparties in the financial industry, such as commercial banks and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions will expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, this credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon liquidation or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results.\nOur ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon customer and other external perceptions of our business practices and our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our business practices or our financial health could damage our reputation in both the customer and funding markets, leading to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Adverse developments with respect to the consumer or other external perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may also adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse reputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships may also adversely impact our reputation. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws, regulations or regulatory actions that may change or constrain the manner in which we engage with our customers and the products we offer. Adverse reputational impacts or events may also increase our litigation risk. We carefully monitor internal and external developments for areas of potential reputational risk and have established governance structures to assist in evaluating such risks in our business practices and decisions.\nThe financial services industry is experiencing continual technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new, technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. We may not be able to effectively implement new, technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and avoid interruptions, errors and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer and commercial credit industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies and business processes may be better than those we currently use. Because the pace of technological change is high and our industry is intensely competitive, we may not be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete or as better ones become available. A failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less competitive, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may experience interruptions or breaches in our information system security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. In addition to our own systems we also rely on external vendors to provide certain services and are therefore exposed to their information security risks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of these information systems, there can be no assurance that any failure or interruption of our systems, or our external vendors systems, will not occur, or, if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed. The volume of business conducted through electronic devices continues to grow and our computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as the systems of external vendors and customers, present security risks and could be susceptible to hacking and identify theft. A breach in security of our systems, including a breach resulting from our newer online capabilities such as mobile banking, increases the potential for fraud losses. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems could result in damage to our reputation, result in loss of customer business,\nsubject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of external vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our customers, which may result in financial losses to us or our customers, privacy breaches against our customers or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take various forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, and other dishonest activities. In recent years, there has been a rise in electronic fraudulent activity within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector, due to cyber-criminals targeting commercial bank accounts.\nIn addition, our operations rely on secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take numerous protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our customers\u2019 information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve and become increasingly sophisticated. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks and those of our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious codes, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact and result in significant losses by us and/or our customers. These threats may originate externally from third parties, such as cyber-criminal and other hackers, third party vendors providing processing or infrastructure-support services, or internally from within our organization. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. These parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, we may be at risk of an operation failure with respect to our customers' systems. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of the threats, the outsourcing of some of our business operations and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information system vulnerabilities.\nOur deposit insurance premiums could increase in the future, which may adversely affect our future financial performance.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions, including BNC. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) at a certain level. Economic conditions since 2008 have increased the rate of bank failures and expectations for further bank failures, requiring the FDIC to make payments for insured deposits from the DIF and prepare for future payments from the DIF.\nDuring 2009, the FDIC imposed a special deposit insurance assessment on all institutions which it regulates, including BNC. This special assessment was imposed due to the need to replenish the DIF, as a result of increased bank failures and expected future bank failures. Any similar, additional measures taken by the FDIC to maintain or replenish the DIF may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2011, final rules to implement changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to the FDIC assessment rules became effective. The rules provide that a depository institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment will be calculated based on the institution\u2019s total assets less tangible equity, rather than the previous base of total deposits. These changes have not materially increased the Company\u2019s FDIC insurance assessments for comparable asset and deposit levels. However, if BNC\u2019s asset size increases or the FDIC takes other actions to replenish the DIF, BNC\u2019s FDIC insurance premiums could increase.\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategy\nWe may not be able to implement aspects of our growth strategy.\nOur growth strategy contemplates the future expansion of our business and operations both organically and by acquisitions, such as through the establishment or acquisition of banks and banking offices in our market area and other markets in Virginia and the Carolinas. Implementing these aspects of our growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to successfully identify acquisition opportunities and strategic partners that will complement our operating philosophy and to successfully integrate their operations with ours, as well as to generate loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances. To successfully acquire or establish banks or banking offices,\nwe must be able to correctly identify profitable or growing markets, as well as attract the necessary relationships and high caliber banking personnel to make these new banking offices profitable. In addition, we may not be able to identify suitable opportunities for further growth and expansion or, if we do, we may not be able to successfully integrate these new operations into our business.\nAs consolidation of the financial services industry continues, the competition for suitable acquisition candidates may increase. We will compete with other financial services companies for acquisition opportunities, and many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more for an acquisition than we are able or willing to pay.\nWe can offer no assurance that we will have opportunities to acquire other financial institutions or acquire or establish any new branches or loan production offices, or that we will be able to negotiate, finance and complete any opportunities available to us.\nIf we are unable to effectively implement our growth strategies, our business, results of operations and stock price may be materially and adversely affected.\nFuture expansion involves risks.\nOur acquisition of other financial institutions or parts of those institutions involves a number of risks, including the risk that:\n\u2022\nwe may incur substantial costs in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners, or in evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local managers, and opening new offices;\n\u2022\nthe institutions we acquire may have distressed assets and there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the value we predict from those assets or that we will make sufficient provisions or have sufficient capital for future losses;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructurings and impairment, or other charges related to the institutions we acquire that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nthere may be substantial lag-time between completing an acquisition and generating sufficient assets and deposits to support costs of the expansion;\n\u2022\nour management\u2019s attention in negotiating a transaction and integrating the operations and personnel of the combining businesses may be diverted from our existing business and we may not be able to successfully integrate such operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nour announcement of additional transactions prior to the completion of the merger could result in a delay in obtaining regulatory or shareholder approval for the merger, which could have the effect of limiting our ability to fully realize the expected financial benefits from the transaction;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition;\n\u2022\nwe may enter new markets where we lack local experience or that introduce new risks to our operations, or that otherwise result in adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nwe may introduce new products and services we are not equipped to manage or that introduce new risks to its operation, or that otherwise result in adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nwe may incur intangible assets in connection with an acquisition, or the intangible assets we incur may become impaired, which could result in adverse short-term effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nwe may assume liabilities in connection with an acquisition, including unrecorded liabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction, and the repayment of those liabilities may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and stock price; or\n\u2022\nwe may lose key employees and customers.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any banking offices that we acquire into our operations or retain customers of those offices. If any of these risks occur in connection with our expansion efforts, it may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to maintain and manage our organic growth, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have grown rapidly in recent years and our business strategy contemplates continued levels of growth, both organically and through acquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to be successful in increasing the volume of loans and deposits or in introducing new products and services at acceptable risk levels and upon acceptable terms while managing the costs and implementation risks associated with our historical or modified organic growth strategy. We may be unable to continue to increase our volume of loans and deposits or to introduce new products and services at acceptable risk levels for a variety of reasons, including an inability to maintain capital and liquidity sufficient to support continued growth. If we are successful in continuing our growth, we cannot assure you that further growth would offer the same levels of potential profitability or that we would be successful in controlling costs and maintaining asset quality. Accordingly, an inability to maintain growth, or an inability to effectively manage growth, could adversely affect out results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nNew bank office facilities and other facilities may not be profitable.\nWe may not be able to organically expand into new markets that are profitable for our franchise. The costs to start up new bank branches and loan production offices in new markets, other than through acquisitions, and the additional costs to operate these facilities would increase our non-interest expense and may decrease our earnings. It may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage our growth through the establishment of bank branches and loan production offices in new markets. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our expansion into any such new markets will successfully attract enough new business to offset the expenses of their operation. If we are not able to do so, our earnings and stock price may be negatively impacted.\nAcquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities may expose us to intangible asset risk, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with any acquisitions, as required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we will record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value and, as such, acquisitions may result in our recording of intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles and goodwill. We will perform a goodwill impairment assessment at least annually. Impairment testing is a two-step process that first compares the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount, and the second step, if necessary, measures impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Adverse conditions in the business climate, including a significant decline in future operating cash flows, a significant change in our stock price or market capitalization, or a deviation from our expected growth rate and performance may trigger impairment losses, which could be materially adverse to our results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe success of our growth strategy depends on our ability to identify and retain individuals with experience and relationships in the markets in which we intend to expand.\nOur growth strategy contemplates that we will expand our business and operations to other markets, particularly in Virginia and the Carolinas. We intend to primarily target market areas that we believe possess attractive demographic, economic or competitive characteristics. To expand into new markets successfully, we must identify and retain experienced key management members with local expertise and relationships in these markets. Competition for qualified personnel in the markets in which we may expand may be intense, and there may be a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the commercial banking industry in these markets. Even if we identify individuals that we believe could assist us in establishing a presence in a new market, we may be unable to recruit these individuals away from other banks or may be unable to do so at a reasonable cost. In addition, the process of identifying and recruiting individuals with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy is often lengthy. Our inability to identify, recruit and retain talented personnel to manage new offices effectively would limit our growth and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe may need additional access to capital, which we may be unable to obtain on attractive terms or at all.\nWe may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments for future growth or to fund losses or additional provision for loan losses in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our stock price negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock is volatile and may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other financial institutions;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional shareholders;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us; or\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.\nA significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.\nSecurities issued by us, including our common stock, are not FDIC insured.\nSecurities issued by us, including our common stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of any bank and are not insured by the FDIC, the DIF or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nThe holders of our subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had $60.0 million of subordinated notes issued by the Parent Company and $23.7 million in junior subordinated debentures outstanding that were issued by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, BNC Bancorp Capital Trust I, BNC Bancorp Capital Trust II, BNC Bancorp Capital Trust III and BNC Bancorp Capital Trust IV, respectively. The subordinated notes and the junior subordinated debentures are senior to the Company's shares of common stock. As a result, the Company must make payments on the subordinated notes and the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on its common stock and, in the event of the Company's bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation, the holders of the subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of the common stock. The Company's ability to pay future distributions depends upon the earnings of BNC and the issuance of dividends from BNC to the Company, which may be inadequate to service the obligations.\nWe may issue additional debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by all or up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate with certainty the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception of such sales, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets and the availability of those shares for sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, future issuances of equity securities, including pursuant to outstanding options, could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We may issue such additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital. Depending on the amount offered and the levels at which we offer the stock, issuances of common or preferred stock could be substantially dilutive to shareholders of our common stock. Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock, phantom shares, stock appreciation rights, options or warrants to purchase our common stock in the future and those stock appreciation rights, options or warrants are exercised or as shares of the restricted stock vest, our shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro-rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders. We cannot predict with certainty the effect that future sales of our common stock would have on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may reduce or eliminate dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we have historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of our common stock, holders of our common stock are not entitled to receive dividends. Downturns in the domestic and global economies could cause our Board of Directors to consider, among other things, reducing or eliminating dividends paid on our common stock. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends before declaring or paying any dividends. Dividends also may be limited as a result of safety and soundness considerations.\nOur articles of incorporation, as amended, amended and restated bylaws, and certain banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions may prohibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89821, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BNCN"}
