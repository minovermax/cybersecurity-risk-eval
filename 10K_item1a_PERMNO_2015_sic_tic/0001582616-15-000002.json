Risk Factors\nOur business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. Some of these risks are described below, and you should take these risks into account in evaluating us or any investment decision involving us. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of the material risk factors.\nRisks Related to the Merger Agreement\nThe conditions under the Merger Agreement to Fortune Brands\u2019 consummation of the tender offer and our subsequent merger with a subsidiary of Fortune Brands may not be satisfied at all or in the anticipated timeframe.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, the consummation of Fortune Brands\u2019 tender offer and subsequent merger is subject to customary conditions. Satisfaction of certain of the conditions is not within our control, and difficulties in otherwise satisfying the conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the consummation of the tender offer and subsequent merger. These conditions include, among other things, there being validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, subject to certain conditions, a number of shares of our common stock that represents at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock immediately prior to the expiration of the tender offer. It also is possible that an event, occurrence, revelation or development of a state of circumstances or facts since the date of the Merger Agreement may have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on the Company, the non-occurrence of which is a condition to the consummation of the tender offer. We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required conditions will be satisfied.\nIn addition, the completion of the Fortune Brands tender offer and the merger are conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. We intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the Merger Agreement. However, no assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained and, even if all such approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nIf the acquisition does not receive, or timely receive, the required regulatory approvals and clearances, or if another event occurs delaying or preventing the acquisition, such delay or failure to complete the acquisition may create uncertainty or otherwise have negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the price per share for our common stock.\nWhile Fortune Brands\u2019 tender offer and the proposed merger are pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could disrupt our business.\nWhether or not Fortune Brands\u2019 tender offer and subsequent proposed merger are consummated, the proposed acquisition may disrupt our current plans and operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The pendency of the acquisition may also divert management's attention and our resources from ongoing business and operations and our employees and other key personnel may have uncertainties about the effect of the pending acquisition, and the uncertainties may impact our ability to retain, recruit and hire key personnel while the acquisition is pending or if it fails to close. We may incur unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the acquisition. Furthermore, we cannot predict how our suppliers, customers and other business partners will view or react to the acquisition upon consummation. If we are unable to reassure our customers, suppliers and other business partners to continue transacting business with us on terms consistent with recent experience, our sales, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe preparations for integration between Fortune Brands and the Company will place a significant burden on many of our employees and on our internal resources. If key personnel depart because of these uncertainties and burdens, or because they do not wish to remain with the combined company, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, whether or not the merger is consummated, while it is pending we will continue to incur costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the proposed merger, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement generally requires the Company to operate its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice pending consummation of the merger and also restricts us from taking certain actions with respect to our business and financial affairs without Fortune Brands\u2019 consent. Such restrictions will be in place until either the merger is consummated or the Merger Agreement is terminated. For these and other reasons, the pendency of the tender offer and merger could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn the event that our proposed merger with a subsidiary of Fortune Brands is not consummated, the trading price of our common stock and our future business and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nThe conditions to the consummation of the proposed acquisition may not be satisfied as noted above. If the acquisition is not consummated, we would remain liable for significant transaction costs, and the focus of our management would have been diverted from seeking other potential strategic opportunities, in each case without realizing any benefits of the proposed acquisition. For these and other reasons, not consummating the acquisition could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, if we do not consummate the acquisition, the price of our common stock may decline significantly from the current market price. Certain costs associated with the acquisition have already been incurred or may be payable even if the acquisition is not consummated. Further, a failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Finally, any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the tender offer and merger, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, vendors and employees or recruiting and retention efforts, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed acquisition.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage or make it difficult for a third party to acquire us prior to the completion of the Fortune Brands tender offer and the merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it difficult for us to entertain a third-party proposal for an acquisition of our Company. These provisions include our agreement, following the expiration of the thirty-five day go-shop period, not to solicit or initiate any additional discussions with third parties regarding other proposals for our acquisition, as well as restrictions on our ability to respond to such proposals subject to fulfillment of certain fiduciary requirements of our board of directors. The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights, including, under certain circumstances, a requirement for us to pay to Fortune Brands a termination fee of approximately $20.0 million, or approximately 3.3% of the purchase price. Subject to the provisions and restrictions in the Merger Agreement, in the event that the Company terminates the Merger Agreement prior to May 29, 2015 to pursue a competing proposal with a party that submitted such proposal during the thirty-five day go-shop period, the termination fee will be $10.0 million, or approximately 1.7% of the purchase price.\nHistorically, following the announcement of a proposed merger, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company and its board of directors. Litigation may be filed against us and the members of our board of directors challenging the Fortune Brands tender offer and merger and an adverse judgment in any such lawsuit may prevent the Fortune Brands tender offer and merger from being completed within the expected timeframe or at all.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nThe home improvement and home building industries recently experienced a prolonged and substantial downturn, and the timing and extent of any recovery in the home improvement and home building industries are uncertain. Further downturns in, or a delay in or only a modest recovery of these industries or the economy could negatively affect the demand for and pricing of our products and our operating results.\nA significant part of our business is affected by levels of home improvement (including repair and remodeling). While the North American housing market stabilized during 2010 through 2013, the prolonged decline in the housing market and downward pressure on prices had an adverse impact on our business. As did many other companies in our industry, we experienced decreased sales and were forced to increase our discounts and promotions, which have continued. The home improvement industry is affected by changes in economic and other conditions such as gross domestic product levels, employment levels, demographic trends, availability of financing, interest rates and consumer confidence. A decrease in employment levels, consumer confidence or the availability of financing for any reason, including as a result of the recent government shutdown, could negatively affect the demand for and pricing of our products which would adversely affect our results of operations. Although the market has generally been improving, it still has not reached pre-2007 levels. Due to the severity of the previous economic downturn, the market may be even more volatile at future indications of market disruptions. As a result, consumer confidence, high levels of unemployment and downward pressure on home prices in the future may make consumers reluctant to make additional investments in existing homes, such as kitchen and bath remodeling projects. In addition, more conservative lending practices, including for home equity loans which are often used to finance repairs and remodeling during the previous economic downturn, limited the ability of consumers to finance home improvements. Any future downturn with respect to these trends facing the home improvement industry, or a delay in the recovery of such trends, may lead to decreases in demand for our products, as well as impair our ability to discontinue sales discounting and sales promotions that we continue to offer.\nA significant part of our business is also affected by levels of new home construction, as our products are often purchased in connection with the construction of a new home. Fewer new home buyers or the failure for the number of new home buyers to increase at expected levels may lead to a decrease in demand for our products or adversely impact our prospects and future performance.\nWe cannot predict the timing and extent of any recovery to the home improvement and homebuilding industries. Any renewed economic turmoil may cause unanticipated shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and in the business models and strategies of our customers. Such shifts may alter the nature and prices of products demanded by the end consumer and our customers and could adversely affect our operating performance.\nIncreases in interest rates and the reduced availability of financing for home improvements may cause our sales and profitability to decrease.\nIn general, demand for home improvement products may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and the reduced availability of financing. Also, trends in the financial industry which influence the requirements used by lenders to evaluate potential buyers can result in reduced availability of financing. If interest rates or lending requirements increase and consequently, the ability of prospective buyers to finance purchases of home improvement products is adversely affected, our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be adversely impacted and the impact may be material.\nWe are dependent on senior management and key personnel, the loss of whom could materially affect our financial performance and prospects.\nOur continued success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our senior management and certain key employees. Our chief executive officer, Mark Buller, has over 26 years of experience in the cabinetry industry. Our other senior executives have an average of approximately 25 years experience in the building product industry. The loss of the experience and services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, our financial performance and our results of operations.\nIf we do not maintain strong brands or respond to changing consumer preferences for cabinet designs and configurations, and purchasing practices, demand for our products and our results could be adversely affected.\nThe cabinetry industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Our continued success depends largely on the introduction and acceptance by our customers of new product lines that respond to such trends, demands and preferences. For example, we have seen an increase in European style, or frameless, cabinets in recent years, and our organic growth has been, and will continue to be, driven in part by our ability to respond efficiently to such changing trends. While we continue to invest in brand building and brand awareness, these initiatives may not be successful. We may not be able to successfully develop and design new brands. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new and improved products, such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling these products may impact the success of our product introductions. If our new or improved products do not gain widespread acceptance, demand for our products may decrease, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nAlthough we are seeing trends for larger kitchens and bathrooms with more cabinets, if these trends shift, demand for our products could decrease. Additionally, we could in the future experience negative mix shift for certain products, with consumers demanding more value-priced products and fewer higher margin products. These shifts could negatively impact our sales and profitability. If our customers cease to increase spending on higher margin products, on which we intend to place greater emphasis, our business prospects and future performance may be adversely impacted.\nConsumers are increasingly using the internet and mobile technology to research home improvement products and enhance their purchasing and ownership experience for these products. E-commerce is a rapidly developing area, and development of a successful e-commerce strategy involves significant time and resources. If we are unable to successfully execute our e-commerce strategies, our brands may lose share.\nIf we do not timely and effectively identify or respond to these changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices, our relationship with our customers could be harmed, the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nIncreased prices for raw materials or finished goods used in our products or increased energy costs could increase our cost of sales and decrease demand for our products, which could adversely affect our revenue or profitability.\nOur profitability is affected by the prices of the raw materials and finished goods used in the manufacturing of our products. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including, among others, changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates and, in some cases, government regulation. For example, certain of our Chinese plywood suppliers have been and continue to be subject to U.S. tariffs. Increased prices could adversely affect our profitability or revenues. We do not have long-term supply contracts for the raw materials and finished goods used in the manufacturing of our products; however, we enter into pricing agreements with certain customers which fix their pricing for specified periods ranging from one to twelve months. Significant increases in the prices of raw materials or finished goods could adversely affect our profit margins, especially if we are not able to recover these costs by increasing the prices we charge our customers for our products. In addition, energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our production and transportation costs for our products. We may not be able to adjust the prices of our products, especially in the short-term, to recover these cost increases in energy. A continual rise in energy costs could increase our operating costs, which could adversely affect our revenue or profitability.\nInterruptions in deliveries of raw materials or finished goods could adversely affect our revenue or profitability.\nOur dependency upon regular deliveries from particular suppliers means that interruptions or stoppages in such deliveries could adversely affect our operations until arrangements with alternate suppliers could be made. If any of our suppliers were unable to deliver materials (in particular, wood) to us for an extended period of time, as the result of financial difficulties, catastrophic events affecting their facilities or other factors beyond our control, or if we were unable to negotiate acceptable terms for the supply of materials with these or alternative suppliers, our business could suffer. We may not be able to find acceptable alternatives, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs for us. Even if acceptable alternatives are found, the process of locating and securing such alternatives might be disruptive to our business. Extended unavailability of a necessary raw material or finished goods could cause us to cease manufacturing of one or more products for a period of time. In addition, the manufacturing process for UltraCraft\u2019s Vision product line includes components which are made by an Italian manufacturer using proprietary technology. The manufacturer\u2019s failure to deliver components could cause us to cease manufacturing the Vision line products.\nOur international sourcing subjects us to additional risks and costs, which may differ in each country in which we do business and may cause our profitability to decline.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 21% of our purchases of raw materials were from vendors outside of the U.S. and Canada. We may decide to increase our international sourcing in the future. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: (i) introduction of non-native invasive organisms into new environments; (ii) recessionary trends in international markets; (iii) legal and regulatory changes and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of laws, including trade restrictions and tariffs; (iv) difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; (v) increases in transportation costs or transportation delays; (vi) work stoppages and labor strikes; (vii) fluctuations in exchange rates (particularly the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies); and (viii) political unrest, terrorism and economic instability. If any of these or other factors were to render the conduct of our business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAny reduction in availability of mortgage financing would adversely affect our business.\nDuring the previous economic downturn, the mortgage lending industry experienced significant instability due to, among other things, defaults on subprime loans and a resulting decline in the market value of such loans. In light of these developments, lenders, investors, regulators and other third parties questioned the adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for several loan programs made available to borrowers. This led to reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, tightened credit requirements, reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums. A deterioration in credit quality among subprime and other nonconforming loans caused almost all lenders to eliminate subprime mortgages and most other loan products that are not conforming loans, FHA/VA-eligible loans or jumbo loans (which meet conforming underwriting guidelines other than loan size). Fewer loan products and tighter loan qualifications made it more difficult for some borrowers to finance the purchase of new homes or repair or remodel existing homes. These factors have reduced the demand for our products. To the extent the mortgage lending industry experiences further downturns or slowed recovery, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nAny future volatility and reduction in liquidity in the financial markets would adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, the credit markets and the financial services industry experienced significant disruptions, characterized by the bankruptcy and failure of several financial institutions and severe limitations on credit availability. The disruptions in the financial markets adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations in a variety of ways. The financial stability of certain of our customers was negatively impacted, which resulted in difficulties in accounts receivable collection and increased bad debt expense for us. A relapse into adverse economic conditions, including those arising from the recent government shutdown, could cause additional financial distress for our customers and could compromise the financial condition of our suppliers, which could result in non-performance by certain of our suppliers. In addition, our own borrowing costs increased. The disruption in the global financial markets has also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business.\nIn addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of November 2013, our Corporate Family rating from Moody\u2019s Global Credit Research is a B2 and our Corporate Credit rating from Standard & Poor\u2019s is a B+. Any decrease in our ratings could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing in the future.\nInflation could adversely affect our business and financial results, particularly in a period of oversupply of homes.\nOur cost of sales is subject to inflationary pressures. Historically, we have been able to recover the effects of inflation through sales price increases. However, we may not be able to raise prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation in the future. Further, the market may not be willing to bear the price increases we would need to make to counteract the effects of inflation. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which historically had a negative impact on housing demand, which significantly affects our business. Moreover, the cost of capital increases as a result of inflation and the purchasing power of our cash resources declines. Current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nWe may not effectively compete in the highly fragmented and very competitive cabinet industry market, which may adversely affect our revenues.\nWe operate in the highly fragmented and very competitive cabinetry industry. Our competitors include national and local cabinetry manufacturers. These can be large consolidated operations which house their manufacturing facilities in large and efficient plants, as well as relatively small, local cabinetmakers. Some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate. Some of our competitors have greater resources available and are less highly leveraged, which may provide them with greater financial flexibility. Moreover, companies in other building products industries may compete with us. To remain competitive, we will need to invest continuously in manufacturing, customer service and support, marketing and our dealer network. We may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive, which would reduce our revenues. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position within each of the markets we serve.\nWe may not be able to increase our manufacturing capacity and our sales force on a fast enough pace to keep up with increased demand.\nWe continually review our manufacturing and assembly operations and sourcing capabilities. Due to the recent economic recovery in the home improvement and new home construction markets, we have begun to increase our manufacturing capacity and sales force. Determining the most efficient manufacturing processes and staffing as we increase production is a challenge. Additionally, identifying and training potential candidates for employment is challenging and time consuming. We incur increased labor and raw material costs to maximize efficiencies and train new employees. If the current recovery of our markets becomes more fast-paced and robust than we anticipate, we may not be able to replace our reduced manufacturing capacity and staffing in a timely fashion and our ability to respond to increased demand could be limited. This would adversely impact our profitability and prospects.\nIncreases in the cost of labor, union organizing activity and work stoppages at our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers could materially affect our financial performance.\nOur business is labor intensive, and, as a result, our financial performance is affected by the availability of qualified personnel and the cost of labor. Currently, none of our employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes or other types of conflicts with personnel could arise or we may become a target for union organizing activity. Some of our direct and indirect suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of facilities where components of our products are manufactured. In addition, organizations responsible for shipping our products may be impacted by occasional strikes staged by the Teamsters Union. Any interruption in the production or delivery of our products could reduce sales of our products and increase our costs.\nWe could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or distribute which could result in significant costs and liabilities, which would reduce our profitability.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. We are also exposed to potential liability and product performance warranty risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products. In the event that any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products, which would result in significant unexpected costs. Any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Further, any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us, which could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs.\nIncreasingly, our homebuilder customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business. Our contractual arrangements with these customers may include our agreement to defend and indemnify them against various liabilities. These claims, often asserted several years after completion of construction, can result in complex lawsuits or claims against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors, including us, and may require us to incur defense and indemnity costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims.\nAlthough we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously, given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of effect of any claim or litigation matter.\nCompliance with government regulation and industry standards may impose significant compliance costs and liabilities, which would adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations.\nOur facilities are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to pollution and the protection of the environment, including those governing emissions to air, discharges to water, storage, treatment and disposal of waste, remediation of contaminated sites and health and safety (including protection of employees and consumers). We may be held liable, or incur fines or penalties, and the amount of liability, fines or penalties may be material, for, among other things, releases of hazardous substances occurring on or emanating from current or formerly owned or operated properties or any associated offsite disposal location, or for contamination discovered at any of our properties from activities conducted by previous occupants.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination or other liabilities relating to our properties and operations could result in significant environmental liabilities. In addition to complying with current and future requirements, some of our products must be certified by industry organizations. Compliance with these regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing, which could adversely impact our competitive position. Further, if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nIf we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may lose exclusivity in our brands, which could reduce our sales and revenue.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, domain name registration, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. We believe that brand recognition is one of several important factors in a consumer\u2019s choice of cabinetry. Current protections may not adequately safeguard our intellectual property and we may incur significant costs to defend our intellectual property rights, which may harm our operating results. Although we are not aware that any of our intellectual property rights infringes upon the proprietary rights of third parties, third parties may make such claims in the future. Any infringement claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming to defend against, result in costly litigation or damages, undermine the exclusivity and value of our brands, decrease sales or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements that may be on terms that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, our financial performance and our results of operations. In addition, we may be forced to pursue potential claims relating to the protection of certain products and intellectual property rights. Such claims could be time consuming, expensive and divert resources.\nThe loss of or deterioration of relationships with our sales representatives could adversely affect our sales and profits.\nWe depend on the services of independent and employee sales representatives to sell a significant portion of our products and provide services and aftermarket support to our customers. Our independent sales representative agreements are typically cancelable by the sales representative after a short notice period, if any at all. Furthermore, many of these independent sales representatives also sell our competitors\u2019 products. Sales representatives, whether independent or employees, typically have relationships with customers that enable them to effectively sell our products. The loss of a substantial number of these relationships, or our failure to maintain good relationships with these sales representatives, could materially reduce our sales and profits.\nDisruptions in our relationships with any one of our key customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our sales is derived from our top customers. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our largest 10 customers accounted for approximately 24% of our sales. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate similar levels of sales from our largest customers in the future. Should one or more of these customers substantially reduce their purchases from us, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn the event of a catastrophic loss of one of our key manufacturing facilities, our business would be adversely affected.\nWhile we manufacture our products in a large number of diversified facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our key manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAdverse weather conditions can have a significant impact on our operating results.\nOur business is sensitive to national and regional weather conditions and natural disasters. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products. In past years, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have caused delays and closures of varying lengths at our manufacturing plants located across the country. In addition, severe weather conditions can cause disruptions in deliveries of raw materials from our suppliers.\nOur customers sell our products in the repair and remodeling and new home construction markets. Construction activity, which drives demand for our products, decreases substantially during periods of cold weather, when it snows or when heavy or sustained rains fall. Such weather conditions can materially and adversely affect our operating results if they occur with unusual intensity, during abnormal periods, or last longer than usual, especially during peak construction periods. In addition, unusually inclement weather has historically discouraged homeowners from visiting retail stores during the affected period and reduced our customers\u2019 sales of our products.\nGoodwill and other intangibles represent a significant amount of our net worth, and a write-off could result in lower reported net income and a reduction of our net worth.\nFuture changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write-off goodwill for the amount of impairment. If a significant write-off is required, the non-cash charge could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth in the period of any such write-off (such write-off, however, would not reduce our consolidated net income for the purposes of the indenture governing the Term Loan Facility).\nIn the event of consolidation of our dealers, through whom we primarily sell our products, pressure may be put on our operating margins, which could harm our profitability.\nIf our dealer base were to consolidate, competition for the business of fewer dealers would intensify. If we do not provide product offerings and price points that meet the needs of our dealers, or if we lose a substantial amount of our dealer base, our profitability could decrease.\nWe may in the future acquire related businesses, which we may not be able to successfully integrate, in which case we may be unable to recoup our investment in those acquisitions.\nWe may, from time to time, explore opportunities to acquire related businesses, some of which could be material to us. As of the date of this report, we have no agreements and are not in any discussions to acquire any material businesses or assets. If we do make acquisitions in the future, our ability to continue to grow will depend upon effectively integrating these acquired companies, achieving cost efficiencies and managing these businesses as part of our company. While we believe we have successfully integrated the operations we have acquired within the last 14 years, we may not be able to effectively integrate newly acquired companies or successfully implement appropriate operational, financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these acquisitions. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, we may not be able to recoup our investment in those acquisitions. Our efforts to integrate these businesses could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions and increased competition. In addition, the process of integrating these businesses could cause the interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our existing business. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of these businesses could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Further, the economic benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions may not develop.\nWe may inherit significant unexpected third-party liabilities and product warranty claims from operations that we have acquired or will acquire in the future, which would increase our costs.\nWe may be subject to unexpected claims and liabilities arising from acquisitions we have made or may make in the future. We have acquired operations in the past and may acquire more operations in the future. Claims or liabilities may include matters involving third party liabilities and warranty claims against those operations we have acquired or may acquire. These claims and liabilities could be costly to defend, could be material in amount and may exceed either the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of the indemnifying parties.\nOur level of indebtedness and significant debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition or our ability to fulfill our obligations and make it more difficult for us to fund our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had total debt outstanding of $148.5 million, consisting of the term loan facility due 2020 (the \"Term Loan Facility\") with quarterly interest payment at LIBOR plus a margin of 4.25%. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Our Debt Structure\"). In addition, on such date, we had approximately $6.9 million of outstanding letters of credit.\nBecause of our high level of indebtedness:\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe will need to use a substantial portion of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u2022\nour debt level increases our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions;\n\u2022\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general;\n\u2022\nour leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments which, among other things, require us to maintain specified financial ratios and limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.\nFor a more detailed discussion of our debt, please see Part IV, Item 15, \u201cExhibits and Financial Statement Schedules,\u201d Note 7, \u201cLong-term debt.\u201d\nDespite our existing level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries will be able to incur more indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks described above, including our ability to service our existing indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. In November 2013, we entered into an asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) that provides us with additional borrowings of up to $25.0 million, subject to a current borrowing base of approximately $19.1 million. Although our ABL Facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, such restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances indebtedness incurred in compliance with such restrictions could be substantial. For example, we may incur additional debt to, among other things, finance future acquisitions, expand through internal growth, fund our working capital needs, comply with regulatory requirements, respond to competition or for general financial reasons alone. As of December 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under our ABL Facility; however, there was approximately $6.9 million outstanding under a letter of credit under our ABL Facility, and therefore, our total availability under the ABL Facility as of December 31, 2014, was approximately $12.2 million. To the extent new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the risks described above would increase.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us under the ABL Facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional equity capital or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial cash flow problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We cannot assure you as to the timing of such asset sales or the proceeds which we could realize from such sales would be sufficient.\nWe are required to pay certain holders of our common stock and certain holders of units of Norcraft Companies LLC for certain tax benefits we may claim, and we expect that the payments we will be required to make will be substantial.\nWe indirectly acquired favorable tax attributes in connection with the Reorganization. SKM Norcraft Corp. and Trimaran Cabinet Corp. benefited from basis adjustments arising from the 2003 acquisition transaction, and SKM Norcraft Corp. and Trimaran Cabinet Corp. also reported net operating losses. In addition, our acquisition of units of Norcraft Companies LLC in connection with future secondary exchanges of units of Norcraft Companies LLC for restricted shares of our common stock or cash are expected to produce additional favorable tax attributes for us. In the future when we acquire units of Norcraft Companies LLC from its members, the anticipated basis adjustments may reduce the amount of tax we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. These basis adjustments may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those assets. These tax attributes collectively would not be available to us in the absence of the Reorganization and the future secondary exchanges. As part of the Reorganization, we entered into three TRAs.\n\u2022\nUnder the first of these TRAs, we generally are required to pay to the holders of common stock of SKM Norcraft Corp. as of immediately prior to the Reorganization 85% of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state or local tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) the tax attributes associated with any increase in tax basis attributable to SKM Norcraft Corp.\u2019s original acquisition of interests in Norcraft Holdings, L.P., (ii) the net operating losses of SKM Norcraft Corp. relating to taxable years ending on or before the date of the Reorganization (calculated by assuming the taxable year of SKM Norcraft Corp. closes on the date of the Reorganization) that are or become available to us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries as a result of the Reorganization, and (iii) tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRAs.\n\u2022\nUnder the second of these TRAs, we generally are required to pay to the holders of common stock of Trimaran Cabinet Corp. as of immediately prior to the Reorganization 85% of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state or local tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) the tax attributes associated with any increase in tax basis attributable to Trimaran Cabinet Corp.\u2019s original acquisition of interests in Norcraft Holdings, L.P., (ii) the net operating losses of Trimaran Cabinet Corp. relating to taxable years ending on or before the date of the Reorganization that are or become available to us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries as a result of the Reorganization, and (iii) tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA.\n\u2022\nUnder the third of these TRAs, we generally are required to pay to the holders of units of Norcraft Companies LLC (other than units that we or our wholly-owned subsidiaries hold) 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state or local tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) certain tax attributes that are created as a result of the exchanges of their units for restricted shares of our common stock or cash, including any basis adjustment relating to the assets of Norcraft Companies LLC and (ii) tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA.\nThe payment obligations under the TRAs are obligations of Norcraft Companies, Inc., not Norcraft Companies LLC, and we expect that the payments we will be required to make under the TRAs will be substantial. Potential future reductions in tax payments for us and TRA payments by us will be calculated using the market value of our common stock at the time of exchange (or the 15 trading days immediately prior to the effective date of any exchange, where we elect to pay cash consideration for units of Norcraft Companies LLC) and the prevailing tax rates applicable to us over the life of the TRAs and will generally be dependent on us generating sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit. Any actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRAs, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges by the holders of limited liability company units, the price of our common stock at the time of the exchange (or the 15 trading days immediately prior to the effective date of any exchange, where we elect to pay cash consideration for units of Norcraft Companies LLC), whether such exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the tax rate then applicable as well as the portion of our payments under the TRAs constituting imputed interest.\nUnder each of these TRAs, we generally retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of the applicable tax savings. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Receivable Agreements.\u201d Payments under the TRAs are not conditioned on the pre-IPO owners of Norcraft Holdings, L.P.'s continued ownership of us.\nPayments under some or all of the TRAs are expected to give rise to certain additional tax benefits attributable to either further increases in basis or in the form of deductions for imputed interest, depending on the TRA and the circumstances. Any such benefits are the subject of the TRAs and will increase the amounts due thereunder. In addition, the TRAs will provide for interest, at a rate equal to LIBOR, accrued from the due date (without extensions) of the corresponding tax return to the date of payment specified by the TRAs.\nPayments under the TRAs will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, consistent with the terms of the TRAs. We will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the TRAs if any basis increases or other benefits (including any net operating losses of SKM Norcraft Corp. and Trimaran Cabinet Corp.) are subsequently disallowed; if it is determined that excess payments have been made to a beneficiary under a TRA, certain future payments, if any, otherwise to be made will be reduced. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the TRAs in excess of the benefits that we actually realize in respect of the attributes to which the TRAs relate.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the TRAs in a manner that does not adversely affect our working capital and growth requirements, if at all.\nIn certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreements to our existing owners may be accelerated and significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreements.\nEach TRA provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations, other changes of control or a material breach by us of such agreement, or if, at any time, the corporation elects an early termination of the TRA, we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits, which upfront payments may be made years in advance of the actual realization of such future benefits, if any of such benefits are ever realized. That immediate payment would be calculated based on certain assumptions, including that the corporate taxpayer would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the TRAs and the net operating losses would be fully utilized over a period of time. As a result, the amount of such immediate payment could be greater than the present value of the payments we would have been required to pay had such acceleration event not occurred. In these situations, our obligations under the TRAs could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the TRAs in a manner that does not adversely affect our working capital and growth requirements, if at all.\nOur ability to pay taxes and expenses, including payments under the tax receivable agreements, may be limited by our structure.\nWe are a holding company and our assets consist of our ownership (directly or indirectly) in Norcraft Holdings Corp. I, Norcraft Holdings Corp. II, and Norcraft Companies LLC. We and our wholly-owned subsidiaries have no material assets other than certain tax assets and our ownership of units of Norcraft Companies LLC and have no independent means of generating revenue. Norcraft Companies LLC is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax (other than as a withholding agent). Instead, taxable income is allocated to holders of its units, including us and our subsidiaries. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our share of any net taxable income of Norcraft Companies LLC and also incur expenses related to our operations. Under the terms of its amended and restated limited liability company agreement, Norcraft Companies LLC is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of its units, including us, subject to the conditions described below. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our operations, including expenses under the TRAs, which we expect will be significant. Our ability to cause Norcraft Companies LLC to make distributions, which generally will be pro rata with respect to all units outstanding of Norcraft Companies LLC, in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and operating expenses, including any payments due under the TRAs, are subject to various factors, including the operating results of our subsidiaries, cash requirements and financial condition, the applicable provisions of Delaware law that may limit the amount of funds available for distribution to its members, compliance by Norcraft Companies LLC and its subsidiaries with restrictions, covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness, including under our notes and our revolving credit agreement, and other agreements entered into by Norcraft Companies LLC or its subsidiaries with third parties. The existing indebtedness of Norcraft and its subsidiaries does not contemplate distributions for the purpose of paying operating and other expenses and liabilities of Norcraft Companies LLC or Norcraft Companies, Inc. As a result, it is possible that Norcraft Companies, Inc. will not have sufficient cash to pay all of its expenses and liabilities, including any tax liabilities. If, as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds and thus our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRAs for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest at a rate equal to either LIBOR or LIBOR plus 200 basis points, depending on the cause for the deferral of payment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe are an \u201cEmerging Growth Company,\u201d as defined in the Securities Act, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSOX\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information that they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if our total annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur stock price could be extremely volatile, and, as a result, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nThe market price of our common stock could be volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, and could lose part or all of their investment. The price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including those described elsewhere in this annual report and others such as:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry;\n\u2022\nour failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts\u2019 projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;\n\u2022\nadditions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nstrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022\nthe passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nterrorist acts, acts of war or periods of widespread civil unrest;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters and other calamities; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market and economic conditions.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of options, or shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock. Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, would likely result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.\nFurther, we have entered into an exchange agreement with certain holders of common units of Norcraft Companies LLC, pursuant to which the holders of these units may exchange their units for restricted shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the exchange agreement, these parties will have the right, from and after the first anniversary of the date of our IPO (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), to exchange their common units in Norcraft Companies LLC for, at the option of Norcraft Companies, Inc., cash or restricted shares of our common stock. In addition, as a part of the Reorganization, certain holders of limited liability company units of Norcraft and certain of our stockholders entered into a new registration rights agreement. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, these holders will have certain rights to register their restricted shares of our common stock. As a result, if we are required to register a significant amount of shares of our common stock and these shares are sold into the market, it could reduce the value of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may deter takeover efforts that could be beneficial to stockholder value.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include a classified board of directors, elimination of the ability of stockholders to call special meetings (except in limited circumstances), supermajority vote requirements for the removal of a director, advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals and supermajority vote requirements for amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval that could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer. As a result, you may lose your ability to sell your stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures, and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of the Company may be unsuccessful.\nThe Sponsors continue to have significant influence over us, including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nWe are currently controlled by funds affiliated with Apax Partners, L.P., Karp Reilly, L.L.C. and Trimaran Capital Partners (our \"Sponsors\"). Investment funds affiliated with the Sponsors beneficially own 51.7% of our outstanding common stock. For as long as the Sponsors continue to beneficially own shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, they will be able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and could exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs, including any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional common stock or other equity securities, the repurchase or redemption of common stock and the payment of dividends. Similarly, the Sponsors have the power to determine matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders without the consent of our other stockholders, have the power to prevent a change in our control and could take other actions that might be favorable to it. Even if its ownership falls below 50%, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur, including our ABL Facility. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nFurther, Norcraft Companies LLC expects to make pro rata tax distributions to its equity holders calculated by reference to the taxable income of Norcraft Companies LLC and assuming such income is subject to tax at the highest combined marginal federal, state and local tax rate then applicable (including any Medicare Contribution tax on net investment income) to an individual (or, if higher, to a corporation) resident in New York, New York (assuming the maximum limitations on the use of deductions for state and local taxes). As a result of the potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and to Norcraft Companies LLC\u2019s other equity holders and potential differences in applicable tax rates, we may receive distributions in excess of our tax liabilities and our payment obligations under the TRAs. As discussed above, we do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock and, to the extent we do not distribute such cash balances as dividends and instead retain such cash balances, Norcraft Companies LLC\u2019s other equity holders would benefit from any value attributable to such accumulated cash balances as a result of their ownership of shares of common stock following an exchange of their common units of Norcraft Companies LLC pursuant to the exchange agreement entered into with them in connection with the Offering.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that certain of our investors do not have an obligation to offer us business opportunities.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, our Sponsors and their respective affiliates (including affiliates who serve on our board of directors) have no obligation to offer us an opportunity to participate in the business opportunities presented to them, even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued (and therefore they may be free to compete with us in the same business or similar business). Furthermore, we renounce and waive and agree not to assert any claim for breach of any fiduciary or other duty relating to any such opportunity against those investors and their affiliates by reason of any such activities unless, in the case of any person who is our director or officer, such opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as an officer or director of us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and certain of our investors and their affiliates (including certain of our directors).\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein and the claim not being one which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our amended restated certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur indemnification obligations may pose substantial risks to our financial condition.\nPursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law against all liability and expense incurred by them in their capacities as directors or officers of us. We also are obligated to pay their expenses in connection with the defense of claims. Our amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, our directors and officers. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers, pursuant to which we will indemnify them to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law in connection with their service in such capacities. We have obtained liability insurance insuring our directors and officers against liability for acts or omissions in their capacities as directors and officers subject to certain exclusions. These indemnification obligations may pose substantial risks to our financial condition, as we may not be able to maintain our insurance or, even if we are able to maintain our insurance, claims in excess of our insurance coverage could be material. In addition, these indemnification obligations and other provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against indemnified persons, and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against such persons, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or our industry, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, or about the industry in which we operate in generally. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes unfavorable research about our business or about the our industry, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 14292, "SIC": 2430, "TIC": "NCFT"}
