The market value of the People\u2019s United common stock to be issued in the merger will depend upon the market price of People\u2019s United common stock. This market price may vary from the closing price of People\u2019s United common stock on the date the merger was announced, on the date that the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the merger was mailed to the Company\u2019s shareholders and on the date on which Company shareholders voted to adopt the merger agreement at a special meeting of shareholders. There will be no adjustment to the consideration paid to Company shareholders in the merger for changes in the market price of either shares of People\u2019s United common stock or Company common stock.\nThe market price of People\u2019s United common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to changes in sentiment in the market regarding People\u2019s United\u2019s operations or business prospects, including market sentiment regarding People\u2019s United\u2019s entry into the merger agreement. These risks may be affected by:\n\u00b7\noperating results that vary from the expectations of People\u2019s United\u2019s management or of securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in People\u2019s United\u2019s business or in the financial services sector generally;\n\u00b7\nregulatory or legislative changes affecting People\u2019s United\u2019s industry generally or its business and operations;\n\u00b7\noperating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to People\u2019s United;\n\u00b7\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or rating agencies;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other material events by People\u2019s United or its competitors; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in global financial markets and economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.\nAccordingly, at the time Company shareholders decided to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting, they did not necessarily know or were not able to calculate the value of the merger consideration they would be entitled to receive upon completion of the merger. Company shareholders are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for both People\u2019s United common stock and Company common stock.\nThe merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms, and the merger may not be completed.\nThe merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions that must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. These conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or may not be completed. In addition, if the merger is not completed by June 26, 2017, either People\u2019s United or the Company may choose not to proceed with the merger, and the parties may mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time. In addition, People\u2019s United and the Company may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances and the Company may be required to pay a termination fee.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock price, future business and financial results of the Company.\nIf the merger is not completed, the ongoing business of the Company may be adversely affected, and the Company will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe Company may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay People\u2019s United a termination fee of $16 million under the merger agreement;\n\u00b7\nthe Company will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u00b7\nunder the merger agreement, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies; and\n\u00b7\nmatters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by Company management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to the Company.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed, the Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. For example, the Company\u2019s business may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. The market price of Company common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. The Company also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against the Company to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect the business, financial results and stock price of the Company.\nLawsuits challenging the merger have been filed against the Company, the Company\u2019s board of directors and People\u2019s United, and an adverse judgment in any such lawsuit or any future similar lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the merger and result in substantial costs to the Company, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers.\nThe Company, its board of directors and People\u2019s United are named as defendants in two purported class action lawsuits in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Suffolk County, and one purported class action lawsuit in the federal district court for the Eastern District of New York, challenging the merger and seeking, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from completing the merger on the agreed-upon terms, and rescission of the merger and/or awarding of damages to the extent the merger is completed. The parties to these actions have entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding a settlement-which, if finally approved by the court, would resolve and release all claims that were brought or could have been brought in these actions-although there can be no assurance that the court will approve such settlement. In addition, additional plaintiffs may also file lawsuits against the Company or People\u2019s United and/or their directors and officers in connection with the merger. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. If the cases are not resolved, these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the merger and result in substantial costs to the Company, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers.\nOne of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no order, injunction or decree issued by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition that prevents the consummation of the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement be in effect. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the Company or People\u2019s United from completing the merger on the agreed upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.\nThe Company will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and could cause customers and others that deal with the Company to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company. Retention of certain employees may be challenging while the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, the Company\u2019s business could be harmed. In addition, the merger agreement restricts the Company from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the merger occurs without the consent of People\u2019s United. These restrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.\nIf the merger is not completed, the Company will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nThe Company has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, the Company would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nThe Company\u2019s results may be adversely affected if it suffers higher than expected losses on its loans or is required to increase its allowance for loan losses.\nThe Company assumes credit risk from the possibility that it will suffer losses because borrowers, guarantors and related parties fail to perform under the terms of their loans. Management tries to minimize and monitor this risk by adopting and implementing what management believes are effective underwriting and credit policies and procedures, including how the Company establishes and reviews the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is determined by continuous analysis of the loan portfolio and the analytical process is regularly reviewed and adjustments may be made based on the assessments of internal and external influences on credit quality. Those policies and procedures may still not prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results. Weak economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of collateral securing those loans. In particular, earlier this year the Company saw worrisome signs of certain commercial real estate markets becoming overheated, and a decline in property values could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the Company\u2019s commercial real estate loans. In addition, deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in regulation and regulatory interpretation and other factors, both within and outside of the Company\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and its operations and income may be affected adversely by changes in laws and regulations governing its operations. The Company may be unable to satisfy the individual minimum capital requirements imposed by the OCC, and lack of compliance may result in regulatory enforcement actions and adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC. Such regulators govern the activities in which the Company may engage. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank\u2019s operations, limit growth rates, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could materially and adversely impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Any new laws, rules and regulations could also make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.\nAs a result of its commercial real estate concentrations, the OCC established individual minimum capital ratios for the Bank that require it to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 9%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 11% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 12%. There is no guarantee that the Bank will be able to maintain compliance with these heightened capital ratios. Any failure by the Bank to comply with these individual minimum capital ratios (including as a result of increases to the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses), may result in regulatory enforcement actions and adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s loan portfolio has a high concentration of commercial real estate loans (inclusive of multifamily and mixed use commercial loans), and its business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with commercial real estate and a decline in property values. The Company\u2019s limitation on the growth of its commercial real estate loan portfolio due to the Company\u2019s concentrated position in such assets could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate interest income and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2016, $1.2 billion, or 72% of the Company\u2019s total gross loan portfolio, was comprised of commercial real estate (inclusive of multifamily and mixed use commercial loans). This type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions. Unlike larger national or regional banks that serve a broader and more diverse geographic region, the Company\u2019s business depends significantly on general economic conditions in the New York metropolitan and Long Island markets, where the majority of the properties securing the multifamily and commercial real estate loans the Company originates, and the businesses of the customers to whom the Company makes its C&I loans, are located. Accordingly, the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, and the value of the collateral securing such loans, may be significantly affected by economic conditions in this region, including changes in the local real estate market, making loan loss levels difficult to predict and increasing the risk that the Company would incur material losses if borrowers default on their loans. A decline in general economic conditions could therefore have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because multifamily and CRE loans represent the large majority of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, a decline in tenant occupancy or rents could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay their loans on a timely basis, which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s net income, as well as the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or increase the level of cash dividends it currently pays to its stockholders. While the Company seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting policies, which generally require that such loans be qualified on the basis of the collateral property\u2019s cash flows, appraised value and debt service coverage ratio, among other factors, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s underwriting policies will protect it from credit-related losses or delinquencies.\nFurthermore, during 2016, the Company became increasingly concerned with conditions in many of its local CRE markets, particularly those in the boroughs of New York City. The Company saw worrisome signs of markets that were becoming overheated. As a result of these concerns, the Company stopped accepting new applications for multifamily loans in the boroughs of New York City during the first quarter of 2016. The CRE lending market is also an area which has attracted significant regulatory scrutiny. The OCC, the Company\u2019s primary bank regulator, has publicly expressed broadly applicable concerns over the last year about overheated conditions in many CRE markets. The OCC established individual minimum capital ratios for the Bank as a result of its concentration of CRE loans. In response, the Company decided to temporarily pull back from the CRE lending markets, which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s net income and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation. Following the Company\u2019s implementation of enhanced risk management processes in order to remain compliant with applicable regulatory guidance, the Company re-entered certain commercial real estate markets that it backed away from, although it has no plans to re-enter the multifamily lending markets in New York City.\nRecent financial reforms and related regulations may affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. For a description of the Dodd-Frank Act see Part I, Item 1. Business, Supervision and Regulation contained in this Form 10-K. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting regulations will impact the Company\u2019s business. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations have resulted in and will likely continue to result in additional costs and these additional costs may adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nAs a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its banking subsidiary, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders depends upon the results of operations of the Bank and its ability to pay dividends to the Company. Dividends paid by the Bank are subject to limits imposed by law and regulation.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s activities are conducted through the Bank, and the Company receives substantially all of its funds (other than the net proceeds of any capital raising transactions that the Company may undertake) through dividends from the Bank. The Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to stockholders depends primarily on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company. Various laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay dividends to its stockholders.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to generate net income depends primarily upon our net interest income. Net interest income is income that remains after deducting from total income generated by earning assets the interest expense attributable to the acquisition of the funds required to support earning assets. Income from earning assets includes income from loans, investment securities and short-term investments. The amount of interest income is dependent on many factors including the volume of earning assets, the general level of interest rates, the dynamics of the change in interest rates and the levels of non-performing loans. The cost of funds varies with the amount of funds necessary to support earning assets, the rates paid to attract and hold deposits, rates paid on borrowed funds and the levels of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and equity capital.\nDifferent types of assets and liabilities may react differently, at different times, to changes in market interest rates. Management expects that the Company will periodically experience gaps in the interest-rate sensitivities of its assets and liabilities. That means either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets or vice versa. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income. Likewise, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Management is unable to predict changes in market interest rates which are affected by many factors beyond our control including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and other governmental monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets. Net interest income is not only affected by the level and direction of interest rates, but also by the shape of the yield curve, relationships between interest sensitive instruments and key driver rates, as well as balance sheet growth, client loan and deposit preferences and the timing of changes in these variables.\nManagement attempts to manage risk from changes in market interest rates, in part, by controlling the mix of interest rate-sensitive assets and interest rate-sensitive liabilities. Management reviews the Company's interest rate risk position and modifies its strategies based on projections to minimize the impact of future interest rate changes. However, interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. A rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with taxation that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe amount of income taxes the Company is required to pay on its earnings is based on federal, state and city laws and regulations. The Company provides for current and deferred taxes in its financial statements, based on its results of operations, business activity, legal structure, interpretation of tax statutes, assessment of risk of adjustment upon audit and application of financial accounting standards. The Company may take tax return filing positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain. The Company\u2019s net income and earnings per share may be reduced if a federal, state or local authority assesses additional taxes that have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its anticipated effective tax rate either due to a change in tax law, a change in regulatory or judicial guidance or an audit assessment that denies previously recognized tax benefits. The new tax provisions of New York State Article 9A allow banking corporations to exclude from income 160% of the dividends it has received from subsidiaries such as a REIT, which is now included in the mandatory combined group. Going forward, the Company may not realize the benefits of the exclusion from income of 160% of the dividends received from the REIT, if the bank\u2019s assets were in excess of $8 billion, resulting in a higher effective state income tax rate. The occurrence of any of these tax-related risks could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are dependent on the economy, as well as competition from other banks. Changing economic conditions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s earnings and increase the credit risk of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s primary market area includes Suffolk County, Nassau County and New York City. Adverse economic conditions in that market area could reduce the Company\u2019s rate of growth, affect customers\u2019 ability to repay loans and result in higher levels of loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and a decline in the values of the collateral (including residential and commercial real estate) securing the Company\u2019s loans, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. General economic conditions, including inflation, unemployment and money supply fluctuations, also may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, competition in the banking industry is intense and the Company\u2019s profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market.\nThe Company may not be able to maintain a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.\nThe Company expects to depend on checking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of deposits as the primary source of funding for its lending activities. The Company\u2019s future growth will largely depend on its ability to maintain a strong core deposit base. There may be competitive pressures to pay higher interest rates on deposits, which would increase the Company\u2019s funding costs. If deposit clients move money out of bank deposits and into other investments (or into similar products at other institutions that may provide a higher rate of return), the Company could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing its funding costs and reducing net interest income and net income. Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in reduced loan originations, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to significant operational risks that could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company\u2019s reputation or foregone business opportunities.\nOperational risk is the risk of loss from operations, including fraud by employees or outside persons, employees\u2019 execution of incorrect or unauthorized transactions and breaches of internal control systems. Operational risk also encompasses technology, compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through its outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company\u2019s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company\u2019s reputation or foregone business opportunities.\nA failure in or breach of the Company\u2019s security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party service providers, could result in financial losses or in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including client information.\nAs a financial institution, the Company may be the target of fraudulent activity that may result in financial losses to the Company and its clients, privacy breaches against its clients or damage to its reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, unauthorized intrusion into or use of the Company\u2019s systems and other dishonest acts. The Company provides its customers with the ability to bank remotely, including online over the Internet. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote banking. The Company\u2019s network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. The Company may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of cybersecurity breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches or viruses. Given the volume of Internet transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified. To the extent that the Company\u2019s activities or the activities of its customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose the Company to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent cybersecurity breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s systems and could adversely affect its reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage. The Company\u2019s risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of the threats from organized cybercriminals and hackers, and the Company\u2019s plans to continue to provide electronic banking services to its customers.\nThe Company depends on its key employees.\nThe Company\u2019s success will, to some extent, depend on the continued employment of its executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on the Company\u2019s business. No assurance can be given that these individuals will continue to be employed by the Company. The loss of any of these individuals could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its growth strategy and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity risk could impair the Company\u2019s ability to fund operations and jeopardize its financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans or securities and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms that are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect the Company specifically or the banking industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact the Company\u2019s access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which its loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against the Company. The Company\u2019s ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to it, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking or financial services industries.\nThe Company may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nThe Company is required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. At some point, the Company may need to raise additional capital. If the Company raises additional capital, it may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, its common stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or convertible securities to new stockholders would be dilutive to the Company\u2019s current stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on the Company\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot be assured of its ability to raise additional capital if needed or to raise capital on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand its operations could be materially impaired and its financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with litigation that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition and cause significant reputational harm to the Company.\nThe Company is subject to litigation risks as a result of a number of factors and from various sources, including the highly regulated nature of the banking industry. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the large or indeterminate damages that may be sought, there can be significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability the Company may incur from litigation matters. Substantial liability against the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition and cause significant reputational harm to the Company, which could seriously harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly, making it difficult to resell shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at times and prices that stockholders may find attractive.\nThe Company cannot predict how its common stock will trade in the future. The market value of the Company\u2019s common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, as well as the other risk factors described herein:\n\u2022\nthe market price of People\u2019s United\u2019s common stock, upon which the consideration to be paid to the Company\u2019s stockholders in the merger is based;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating and financial results;\n\u2022\ndevelopments related to investigations, proceedings or litigation involving the Company;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\ndispositions, acquisitions and financings;\n\u2022\nactions of the Company\u2019s current stockholders, including sales of common stock by existing stockholders and the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of the Company\u2019s competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments; and\n\u2022\ndevelopments related to the financial services industry.\nThe market value of the Company\u2019s common stock may also be affected by conditions affecting the financial markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations. These conditions may result in volatility in the market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, the Company\u2019s common stock and sales of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock in the market, in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the Company\u2019s operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity, which may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nSubject to the limitations under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the number of shares of the Company\u2019s authorized capital stock, the Company is not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or any substantially similar securities. The market value of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline as a result of sales by the Company of a large number of shares of common stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s charter and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of New York and federal laws and regulations could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, despite the possible benefit to its stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. These provisions include the election of directors to staggered terms of three years, advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings and the requirement that directors fill vacancies on the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. In addition, the BHC Act, as amended, and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, together with federal regulations, require that, depending on the particular circumstances, either regulatory approval must be obtained or notice must be furnished to the appropriate regulatory agencies and not disapproved prior to any person or entity acquiring control of a national bank, such as the Bank. These provisions may prevent a merger or acquisition that may be attractive to stockholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for the Company\u2019s common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of the Company\u2019s common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 75509, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SCNB"}
