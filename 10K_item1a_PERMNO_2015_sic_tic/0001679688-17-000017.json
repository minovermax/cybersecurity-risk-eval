Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us that we currently deem immaterial or that generally apply to all businesses also may adversely impact our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.

Examples of differences between NSAM\u2019s, Colony\u2019s and NRF\u2019s businesses and the new or increased risks we face include:\n\u2022\na large increase in the amount of assets under management and a diversification of types of assets under management, which may create risks related to scaling and combining of the platforms necessary to manage the combined assets of the companies;\n\u2022\nadditional conflicts between and among the clients and managed vehicles of the company;\n\u2022\ncertain investment vehicles historically managed by NSAM or Colony may compete for investment opportunities and may be adversely impacted to the extent such opportunities are allocated between them;\n\u2022\nour possible failure to successfully implement our plan to optimize our combined portfolio consisting primarily of owned real estate; and\n\u2022\nour larger and newly-combined team of management and employees may require time to become fully effective and may not be able to achieve our anticipated synergies and higher earnings growth.\nAdverse changes in general economic conditions can negatively affect our business, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is dependent upon general economic conditions in the United States and in the international geographic areas where a substantial number of our investments are located. Adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States or these countries or regions would likely have a negative impact on real estate values and, accordingly, our financial performance, the market prices of our securities, and our ability to pay dividends.\nOur business is also closely tied to general economic conditions in the real estate industry. As a result, our economic performance, the value of our real estate and real estate related investments, and our ability to implement our business strategies may be significantly and adversely affected by changes in economic conditions in the United States and in the international geographic areas where a substantial number of our investments are located. The condition of the real estate markets in which we operate is cyclical and depends on the condition of the economy in the United States, Europe, China and elsewhere as a whole and to the perceptions of investors of the overall economic outlook. Rising interest rates, declining employment levels, declining demand for real estate, declining real estate values or periods of general economic slowdown or recession, increasing political instability or uncertainty, or the perception that any of these events may occur have negatively impacted the real estate market in the past and may in the future negatively impact our operating performance. In addition, the economic condition of each local market where we operate may depend on one or more key industries within that market, which, in turn, makes our business sensitive to the performance of those industries.\nWe have only a limited ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. Certain significant expenditures, such as debt service costs, real estate taxes, and operating and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when market conditions are poor. These factors impede us from responding quickly to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect the value of our investments and cause our interest expense to increase, which could result in reduced earnings or losses and negatively affect our profitability as well as the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nOur investment in certain assets may decline in value if long-term interest rates increase. Declines in market value may ultimately reduce earnings or result in losses to us, which may negatively affect cash available for distribution to our stockholders. If long-term interest rates increased significantly, the market value of certain investments may decline, and the duration and weighted average life of these investments may increase. As a result, we could realize a loss if these investments were sold prior to maturity.\nIn addition, in a period of rising interest rates, our operating results will partially depend on the difference between the income from our assets and financing costs. We anticipate that, in some cases, the income from such assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings. Consequently, changes in interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates, may significantly influence our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning investments and the interest expense we incur in financing these investments. Increases in these rates could decrease our net income and the market value of our assets.\nRising interest rates may also cause our target investments that were issued prior to an interest rate increase to provide yields that are below prevailing market interest rates. If rising interest rates cause us to be unable to acquire a sufficient volume of our target investments with a yield that is above our borrowing cost, our ability to satisfy our investment objectives and to generate income and pay dividends may be materially and adversely affected. An increase in interest rates may cause a decrease in the volume of certain of our target investments, which could adversely affect our ability to acquire target investments that satisfy our investment objectives and to generate income and make distributions to our stockholders. As a result of the foregoing, significant fluctuations in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nOur business depends in large part on our ability to raise capital from investors through the issuance of public securities as well as, but not limited to, Retail Companies and private funds. If we were unable to raise such capital or deploy such capital into investments, there may be a material reduction in our revenues and cash flow, which would adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur ability to raise capital through the issuance of public securities as well as, but not limited to, Retail Companies and private funds depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside our control, such as the general economic environment or the number of offerings in the market or other investment vehicles being raised at the same time by our competitors that are focused on the same or similar investment strategies. Additionally, investors may downsize (or even eliminate) their investment allocations to alternative investments, including private funds, non-traded REITs, 1940 Act funds, and hedge funds, to rebalance a disproportionate weighting of their overall investment portfolio among asset classes. Poor performance of our Company or our managed vehicles could also make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Investors in our managed vehicles may decline to invest in future vehicles we raise, and investors may withdraw their investments in our managed vehicles (on specified withdrawal dates) as a result of poor performance. Our investors and potential investors continually assess our Company\u2019s and managed vehicles\u2019 performance independently and relative to market benchmarks and our competitors, and our and such managed vehicles\u2019 ability to raise capital depends, on our or any such managed vehicle\u2019s performance. To the extent economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may be unable to raise sufficient amounts of capital to support the investment activities of our Company and managed vehicles.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the quality of service provided to clients, brand recognition and business reputation. Our investment management business competes for clients, personnel and investment opportunities with a large number of private equity funds, specialized investment funds, hedge funds, corporate buyers, traditional investment managers, commercial banks, investment banks, other investment managers and other financial institutions, and we expect that competition will increase. Numerous factors serve to increase our competitive risks, some of which are outside of our control, including that:\n\u2022\na number of our competitors have more personnel and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do;\n\u2022\nmany of our competitors have raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital, and many of them have investment objectives similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that we seek to exploit;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors (including strategic competitors) may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to our managed vehicles, particularly our managed vehicles that directly use leverage or rely on debt financing of their portfolio companies to generate superior investment returns;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments;\n\u2022\nour competitors may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment that we cannot, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment;\n\u2022\nthere are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new funds, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various lines of business, including major commercial and investment banks and other financial institutions, have resulted in increased competition;\n\u2022\nsome investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager whose equity securities are not traded on a national securities exchange;\n\u2022\nsome investors may prefer to pursue investments directly instead of investing through one of our funds;\n\u2022\nother industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us; and\n\u2022\nother investment managers may offer more products and services than we do, have more diverse sources of revenue or be more adept at developing, marketing and managing new products and services than we are.\nWe may find it harder to raise managed vehicles, and we may lose investment opportunities in the future, if we do not match the fees, structures and terms offered by competitors to their fund clients. Alternatively, we may experience decreased profitability, rates of return and increased risk of loss if we match the prices, structures and terms offered by competitors. This competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future managed vehicles, either of which would adversely impact our business, revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe require capital to comply with our distribution requirements as a REIT and to continue to operate and grow our business and portfolio of target investments, and the failure to obtain such financing would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to maintain our distributions to our stockholders.\nWe require capital to fund acquisitions and originations of our target investments, to fund our operations, including overhead costs, to fund distributions to our stockholders and to repay principal and interest on our borrowings. We expect to meet our capital requirements using cash on hand, cash flow generated from our operations, and principal and interest payments received from our investments. However, because of distribution requirements imposed on us to qualify as a REIT which generally require that we distribute to our stockholders 90% of our taxable income and that we pay tax on any undistributed income, our ability to finance our growth must largely be funded by external sources of capital. As a result, we may have to rely on third-party sources of capital, including public and private offerings of securities and debt financings. Financing may not be available to us when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. In the event that we are unable to obtain adequate financing to fund or grow our business, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire additional assets and make our debt service payments and our financial condition, results of operations and the ability to fund our distributions to our stockholders would be materially adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that our share repurchase program and planned deleveraging transactions will be successful or that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations.\nSubject to our ability to continue to qualify as a REIT, and to our ability to access the necessary cash without significant adverse tax consequences, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program that permits us to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market or otherwise, in an aggregate amount of up to $300.0 million until February 28, 2018. We may also engage in deleveraging transactions, including repayment of debt or repurchase of preferred stock. Our ability to access cash to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock and/or shares of our preferred stock without adverse tax consequences is limited prior to January 2019, but those limitations would not apply to other potential deleveraging transactions. The actual number of shares to be repurchased will depend, however, on the market price of our Class A common stock at the time the share repurchase program is implemented. Assuming the entire $300.0 million program were used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock, and using the closing price of Class A common stock as reported on the NYSE on February 27, 2017, the program would involve the purchase of approximately 20.8 million shares of our Class A common stock. There can be no assurance as to the number of shares that will be repurchased, if any, or the amount of any deleveraging transactions, and the share repurchase program and/or plans to deleverage can be discontinued at any time.\nOur credit facility permits us to incur significant indebtedness, which could require that we generate significant cash flow to satisfy the payment and other obligations under our credit facility.\nWe may incur significant indebtedness in connection with draws under our credit facility. This indebtedness may exceed our cash on hand and/or our cash flows from operating activities. Our ability to meet the payment and other obligations under our credit facility depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow in the future. Our ability to generate cash flow, to some extent, is\nsubject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under our credit facility. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our credit facility and other debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under our credit facility, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity.\nFurthermore, our obligations under the terms of our borrowings could impact us negatively. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from paying dividends to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our borrowings, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities.\nBecause we use debt to finance investments, our cash flow could be adversely affected.\nMany of our investments are made by borrowing a portion of the total investment and securing the loan with a mortgage on the property. We typically borrow on a non-recourse basis to limit our exposure on any property to the amount of equity invested in the property. If we are unable to make our debt payments as required, a lender could foreclose on the property or properties securing its debt. Additionally, lenders for our mortgage loan transactions incorporate various covenants and other provisions that can cause a technical loan default, including loan to value ratio, debt service coverage ratio, and material adverse changes in the borrower\u2019s or tenant\u2019s business. Accordingly, if the real estate value declines or the tenant defaults, the lender would have the right to foreclose on its security. If any of these events were to occur, it could cause us to lose part or all of our investment, which could reduce the value of our portfolio and revenues available for distribution to our stockholders.\nWe may also secure financing that would require us to make a balloon payment at maturity. Our ability to make such balloon payments may depend upon our ability to refinance the obligation, invest additional equity, or sell the underlying property. When a balloon payment is due, however, we may be unable to refinance the balloon payment on terms as favorable as the original loan, make the payment with existing cash or cash resources, or sell the property at a price sufficient to cover the payment. Our ability to accomplish these goals will be affected by various factors existing at the relevant time, such as the state of national and regional economies, local real estate conditions, available mortgage or interest rates, availability of credit, our equity in the mortgaged properties, our financial condition, the operating history of the mortgaged properties, and tax laws. A refinancing or sale could affect the rate of return to stockholders and the projected disposition timeline of our assets.\nOur outstanding indebtedness and indebtedness to be incurred in the future could subject us to increased risk of loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nAs deemed appropriate by our management in its discretion, we may incur indebtedness, which, together with our existing indebtedness, could subject us to several risks, including, among others, that:\n\u2022\nOur cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal of and interest on the debt or we may fail to comply with all of the other covenants contained in the debt, which is likely to result in:\n\u2022\nacceleration of such debt (and any other debt containing a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision) that we may be unable to repay from internal funds or to refinance on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nour inability to borrow unused amounts under our financing arrangements, even if we are current in payments on borrowings under those arrangements; and/or\n\u2022\nthe loss of some or all of our assets to foreclosure or sale;\n\u2022\nOur debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions with no assurance that investment yields will increase with higher financing costs;\n\u2022\nWe may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, future business opportunities, stockholder distributions or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to refinance debt that matures prior to the investment it was used to finance on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe depend on our key personnel, and the loss of their services, through the termination of their employment agreements, or investor confidence in such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on the efforts, skill, reputations and business contacts of our key personnel, including our executive officers, which include our Executive Chairman, Thomas J. Barrack, Jr., our Executive Vice Chairman, David Hamamoto and our Chief Executive Officer and President, Richard B. Saltzman, in particular, and the services of the other members of our senior management team, including Messrs. Tangen, Sanders and Traenkle, each of whom has entered into an employment agreement with us. For instance, the extent and nature of the experience of our executive officers and the nature of the relationships they have developed with real estate professionals and financial institutions are critical to the success of our business. We cannot assure stockholders of the continued employment with these individuals. The loss of services of certain of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to effectively operate our business. Furthermore, our key personnel possess substantial experience and expertise and have strong business relationships with investors in our managed vehicles and other members of the business community. As a result, the loss of these key personnel could jeopardize our relationships with investors in our managed vehicles and members of the business community and result in the reduction of capital or fewer investment opportunities.\nOur board of directors has adopted, and will likely continue to adopt, certain incentive plans to establish incentives that will allow us to retain and attract the services of key employees. These incentive plans may be tied to the performance of our Class A common stock. Further, the agreements we entered into with certain members of our senior management team contain certain restrictions on these executives, including a restriction on engaging in activities that are deemed competitive to our business. Although we believe these covenants to be enforceable under current law in the states in which we do business, there can be no guarantee that if our executives were to breach these covenants and engage in competitive activities, a court of law would fully enforce these restrictions. If our executives were to terminate their employment with us and engage in competitive activities, such activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecruiting and retaining professionals may be more difficult in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel and other professionals. Our future success and growth depends to a substantial degree on our ability to retain and motivate our key personnel and to strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to recruit, retain and motivate the required personnel as the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive. Competition for experienced real estate professionals could require us to pay higher wages and provide additional benefits to attract or retain qualified employees, which could result in higher compensation expenses to us, which could cause our total employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of our total revenue to increase and adversely affect our profitability.\nEmployee misconduct, which is difficult to detect and deter, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm. Fraud and other deceptive practices or other misconduct of the companies that we manage could similarly subject us to liability and reputational damage and also harm our performance.\nThere have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry, and there is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. We are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our business and our authority over the assets we manage. The violation of any of these obligations or standards by any of our employees or advisors could adversely affect our clients and us. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which we may invest or to the companies that we manage. If our employees improperly use or disclose confidential information, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If our employees engage in misconduct, or if they are accused of misconduct, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have devoted greater resources to enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA. In addition, the United Kingdom has significantly expanded the reach of its anti-bribery laws. While we have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by us and our personnel with the FCPA, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA, UK anti-bribery laws or other applicable anti-corruption laws could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties, material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we may also be adversely affected if there is misconduct by the personnel of the companies that we manage. For example, failures by personnel at the companies that we manage to comply with anti-bribery, trade sanctions or other legal and\nregulatory requirements could adversely affect our business and reputation. We may face increased risk of such misconduct to the extent our investment in non-U.S. markets, particularly emerging markets, increases. Such misconduct might undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such companies and could negatively affect the valuation of our managed vehicles\u2019 investments.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties following the Mergers and we could fail to achieve synergies anticipated in the Mergers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Mergers on employees and clients may have an adverse effect on us following the Mergers. These uncertainties could disrupt our business and impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, and cause clients and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships, cease doing business with us or cause potential new clients to delay doing business with us. Retention and motivation of employees may be challenging due to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us.\nAdditionally, we could fail to achieve beneficial synergies expected from the Mergers, or it may take longer to achieve such synergies than anticipated. Such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe often pursue investment opportunities that involve business, regulatory, legal or other complexities and the failure to successfully manage such risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe often pursue unusually complex investment opportunities involving substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity that would deter other investors. Our tolerance for complexity presents risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute; it can be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions; and such transactions sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent liabilities. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations financial condition.\nMany of our investments may be illiquid and we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions.\nInvestments in mortgage-related assets generally experience periods of illiquidity. The lack of liquidity may result from the absence of a willing buyer or an established market for these assets, as well as legal or contractual restrictions on resale or the unavailability of financing for these assets. In addition, certain of our target assets, such as mezzanine loans, junior participations and bridge and other loans, are also particularly illiquid investments due to their short life, their potential unsuitability for securitization and the greater difficulty of recovery in the event of a borrower\u2019s default. Further, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a business entity to the extent that we have or could be attributed with material, non-public information regarding such business entity. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments at advantageous times or in a timely manner if the need or desire arises, including, if necessary, to maintain our status as a REIT or to maintain our exemption from the 1940 Act. Moreover, turbulent market conditions, such as those experienced recently, could significantly and negatively affect the liquidity of our assets. As a result, our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited, which may cause us to incur losses. If we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our assets. If and to the extent that we use leverage to finance our investments that are or become liquid, the adverse impact on us related to trying to sell assets in a short period of time for cash could be greatly exacerbated.\nChanges in the debt financing markets could negatively impact our ability to obtain attractive financing or re-financing for our investments and could increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income.\nA significant contraction in the market for debt financing, such as the contraction that occurred in 2008 and 2009, or other adverse change relating to the terms of such debt financing with, for example, higher rates, higher equity requirements and/or more restrictive covenants, particularly in the area of acquisition financings for leveraged buyout and real assets transactions, could have a material adverse impact on our business. In the event that we are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at an increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms, we may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case, either of which could lead to a decrease in the income earned by us. Similarly, we regularly utilize the corporate debt markets in order to obtain financing for our operations. To the extent that the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact our operating performance. In addition, to the extent that the markets make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, we may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection.\nOur significant operations in Europe and elsewhere expose our business to risks inherent in conducting business in foreign markets.\nA significant portion of our revenues are sourced from our foreign operations in Europe and elsewhere. Accordingly, our firm-wide results of operations depend in part on our foreign operations. Conducting business abroad carries significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions and problems relating to the repatriation of profits;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws;\n\u2022\nlaws restricting foreign companies from conducting business;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe impact of different business cycles and economic instability;\n\u2022\npolitical instability and civil unrest;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in perfecting our security interests, collecting accounts receivable, foreclosing on secured assets and protecting our interests as a creditor in bankruptcies in certain geographic regions;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nshare ownership restrictions on foreign operations;\n\u2022\ntariff regimes of the countries in which we do business; and\n\u2022\ngeographic, time zone, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world.\nFluctuations in foreign currencies, exchange controls and other restrictions on the repatriation of funds, may significantly affect our operating performance, liquidity and the value of any cash held outside the United States in local currency. In addition, changes in policies or laws of U.S. or foreign governments resulting in, among other things, higher taxation, currency conversion limitations, restrictions on fund transfers, capital raising or the expropriation of private enterprises, could reduce the anticipated benefits of our international operations. Any actions by countries in which we conduct business to reverse policies that encourage investment could adversely affect our business. If we fail to realize the anticipated growth of our future international operations, our business and operating results could suffer.\nConcerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency, given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries and in recent declines and volatility in the value of the euro. These concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be uncertain. Such uncertainty would extend to among other things, whether obligations previously expressed to be owed and payable in euros would be re-denominated in a new currency, what laws would govern and the courts of which country would have jurisdiction. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could materially adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations.\nIn addition, market concerns about economic growth in the Eurozone relative to the United States and speculation surrounding the potential impact on the euro of the exit of a country from the Eurozone may continue to exert downward pressure on the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the euro, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, increased uncertainty in the wake of the \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016, in which the majority of voters voted in favor of an exit from the European Union, has resulted in an increase in volatility in the global financial markets. Uncertainty about global or regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news, and declines in income or asset values, which could adversely affect the availability of financing, our business and our results of operations.\nExtensive regulation in the United States and abroad affects our activities, increases the cost of doing business and creates the potential for significant liabilities and that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nPotential regulatory action poses a significant risk to our reputation and our business. Our business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and foreign government agencies and self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions in the United States, are empowered to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular activities, and to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including censure, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension\nor expulsion of applicable licenses and memberships. Even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator were small in monetary amount, the costs incurred in responding to such matters could be material and the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing investors or fail to gain new investors or discourage others from doing business with us.\nIn the past several years, the financial services industry, and private equity in particular, has been the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators around the globe. In particular, the SEC and its staff have focused more narrowly on issues relevant to alternative asset management firms, including by forming specialized units devoted to examining such firms and, in certain cases, bringing enforcement actions against the firms, their principals and employees. Notably, in the last few years, there were a number of enforcement actions within the industry, and the SEC may continue to pursue such enforcement actions in 2017. This increased enforcement activity may cause us to reevaluate certain practices and adjust our compliance control function as necessary and appropriate. We are involved in certain trading activities that implicate a broad number of U.S. securities law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical trading requirements that implicate fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of these laws could result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation.\nWe regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the 1940 Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, and the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, in conducting our investment activities in the United States. Similarly, in conducting our investment activities outside the United States, we rely on available exemptions from the regulatory regimes of various foreign jurisdictions. These exemptions from regulation within the United States and abroad are sometimes highly complex and may, in certain circumstances, depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us, we could become subject to regulatory action or third-party claims and our business could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in our funds and are not designed to protect our stockholders. Consequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities and impose burdensome compliance requirements.\nFurthermore, we may become subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as we expand our product offerings and investment platform, including raising additional funds.\nIn addition, as a result of the global financial crisis and highly-publicized financial scandals, investors have exhibited concerns over the integrity of the U.S. financial markets and the domestic regulatory environment in which we operate in the United States. We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC or other U.S. governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Regulatory focus on our industry has intensified in recent years and is expected to continue.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank of 2010 has changed and is expected to continue changing the regulatory environment for alternative investment funds, including funds that we manage and our future funds. Dodd-Frank expanded the registration requirements for investment advisers managing such funds, as well as subjecting large funds to supervisory oversight for purposes of assessing their potential to contribute to systemic risk. Title VII of Dodd-Frank provides for significantly increased regulation of and restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions that could affect our interest rate hedging or other risk management activities, including: (i) regulatory reporting for swaps; (ii) mandated clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated exchanges or electronic facilities for certain swaps; and (iii) margin and collateral requirements. While the full impact of Dodd-Frank on our interest rate hedging activities cannot be assessed until implementing rules and regulations are adopted and market practice develops, the requirements of Title VII may affect our ability to enter into hedging or other risk management transactions, may increase our costs in entering into such transactions and may result in us entering into such transactions on less favorable terms than prior to effectiveness of Dodd-Frank and the rules promulgated thereunder. Although the SEC and other U.S. regulatory agencies have begun issuing rules and regulations to implement the requirements of Dodd-Frank, some provisions of Dodd-Frank still require the adoption of implementing regulations by the applicable agencies. Accordingly, it is not possible to assess Dodd-Frank\u2019s full impact on us, our funds or, in some cases, the instruments in which our funds may invest. As the regulatory environment evolves, compliance with any new laws or regulations could be difficult and may adversely affect the value of instruments held by our funds or the ability of our funds to pursue their investment strategies.\nIn addition, we may be impacted indirectly by guidance recently directed to regulated banking institutions with regard to leveraged lending practices. In March 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued updated guidance on credit transactions characterized by a high degree of financial leverage. To the extent that such guidance limits the amount or increases the cost of financing we are able to obtain for our transactions, the returns on our investments may suffer.\nIt is difficult to determine the full extent of the impact on us of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law. Any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business, including the changes described above, may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which we conduct our business. Moreover, as calls for additional regulation have increased, there may be a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative asset management funds, including our managed vehicles. Compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to the risk of substantial litigation and face significant regulatory oversight. In recent years, the volume of claims and the amount of potential damages claimed in such proceedings against the financial services industry have generally been increasing. The investment decisions we make may subject us to the risk of third-party litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with our performance, alleged conflicts of interest, the activities of the companies that we manage and a variety of other litigation claims and regulatory inquiries and actions. From time to time we may be subject to regulatory actions and shareholder class action suits relating to transactions in which we have agreed to acquire public companies.\nIn addition, to the extent that our investors suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, investors may have remedies against us, our managed vehicles, our principals or our affiliates. Heightened standards of care or additional fiduciary duties may apply in certain of our managed accounts or other advisory contracts. To the extent we enter into agreements with clients containing such terms or applicable law mandates a heightened standard of care or duties, we could, for example, be liable to certain clients for acts of simple negligence or breach of such duties, which might include the allocation of a client\u2019s funds to our managed vehicles. Even in the absence of misconduct, we may be exposed to litigation or other adverse consequences where investments perform poorly and investors in or alongside our managed vehicles experience losses.\nIf any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, the lawsuit could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could materially impact our business. We depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our managed vehicles. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants (including investors in or alongside our managed vehicles) or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the private equity industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses.\nIn addition, with a workforce composed of many highly paid professionals, we face the risk of litigation relating to claims for compensation, which may, individually or in the aggregate, be significant in amount. The cost of settling any such claims could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with \u201cpay to play\u201d regulations implemented by the SEC and certain states, and changes to the \u201cpay to play\u201d regulatory regimes, could adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, the SEC and several states have initiated investigations alleging that certain private equity firms and hedge funds or agents acting on their behalf have paid money to current or former government officials or their associates in exchange for improperly soliciting contracts with state pension funds. The SEC has also initiated a similar investigation into contracts awarded by sovereign wealth funds. Rule 206(4)-5 under the Investment Advisers Act addresses \u201cpay to play\u201d practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to government officials able to exert influence on potential government entity clients. Among other restrictions, the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government entity for two years, subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make contributions to certain candidates and officials in a position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government entity. Advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain of the adviser\u2019s employees and engagements of third parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records in order to enable the SEC to determine compliance with the rule. Additionally, California law requires placement agents (including in certain cases employees of investment managers) who solicit funds from California state retirement systems, such as the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, to register as lobbyists, thereby becoming subject to increased reporting requirements and prohibited from receiving contingent compensation for soliciting investments from California state retirement systems. New York has adopted similar rules. Such investigations may require the attention of senior management and may result in fines if any of our funds are deemed to have violated any regulations, thereby imposing additional expenses on us. Any failure on our part to comply with these rules could cause us to lose compensation for our advisory services or expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage.\nThe historical financial information included in this annual report is not necessarily indicative of our future performance.\nThe historical financial information included in this annual report is not necessarily indicative of our future financial results, in particular because the historical financial information is related only to NSAM. This financial information does not purport to represent or predict the results of any future periods.\nThe results of future periods are likely to be materially different as a result of:\n\u2022\nfuture growth that does not follow our historical trends;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic environment, competitive landscape and financial markets;\n\u2022\nnew and additional costs and expenses attributable to our operations, including our operations as a public company, an adviser and a company within an extensively regulated industry; and\n\u2022\nthe transitions we are undergoing as a result of the Mergers, resulting in our operations as a single public entity.\nFailure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, breach of contracts, reputational harm or legal liability. Furthermore, as an asset manager our business is highly dependent on information technology systems, including systems provided by third parties over which we have no control. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the information technology systems, but any failure or interruption of our systems could cause delays or other problems in our activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Potential sources for disruption, damage or failure of our information technology systems include, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, human error, cyber attacks, natural disasters and defects in design.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our stock price may suffer.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors are required to issue an opinion on their audit of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken and our stock price may suffer. For instance, accounting irregularities recently discovered at other companies have caused the SEC to launch an inquiry, stockholders to initiate lawsuits, executives to resign, the stock price to significantly decrease and the firm\u2019s reputation to be questioned by stockholders and the press.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and holders of our Class A common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment due to drops in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile especially as a result of the Mergers and stockholders may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the implied price at which they acquired such common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise due to fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock, including changes in market price caused by factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\nSpecific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price of our Class A common stock following completion of the Mergers include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our common stock, other companies comparable to it or companies in the industries we serve;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u2022\nreactions to public announcements by us;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions taken by our company or our competitors, such as the intended business separations, acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nfailure of our company to achieve the perceived benefits of the transactions, including financial results and anticipated synergies, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;\n\u2022\nadverse conditions in the financial market or general U.S. or international economic conditions, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism and responses to such events; and\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our company, members of our management team or significant stockholders.\nWe may issue additional equity securities, which may dilute your interest in us.\nIn order to expand our business, we may consider offering Class A common stock and securities that are convertible into our Class A common stock and may issue additional common stock in connection with acquisitions or joint ventures. If we issue and sell additional shares of our Class A common stock, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted to the extent they do not participate in the offering. The number of shares of Class A common stock that we may issue for cash in non-public offerings without stockholder approval will be limited by the rules of the NYSE. However, we may issue and sell shares of our Class A common stock in public offerings, and there generally are exceptions that allow companies to issue a limited number of equity securities in private offerings without stockholder approval, which could dilute your ownership.\nOur board of directors may modify our authorized shares of stock of any class or series and may create and issue a class or series of common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur charter authorizes our board of directors to, without stockholder approval, classify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock; reclassify any previously classified, but unissued, shares of common stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock; and issue such shares of stock so classified or reclassified. Our board of directors may determine the relative rights, preferences, and privileges of any class or series of common stock or preferred stock issued. As a result, we may issue series or classes of common stock or preferred stock with preferences, dividends, powers, and rights (voting or otherwise) senior to the rights of current holders of our Class A common stock. The issuance of any such classes or series of common stock or preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur Class A common stock may be delisted, which could limit your ability to trade our Class A common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur Class A common stock is listed on the NYSE, a national securities exchange. However, our Class A common stock may not continue to be listed on the NYSE in the future. If the NYSE delists our Class A common stock from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company;\n\u2022\na decreased ability for us to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; and\n\u2022\nlimited liquidity for our stockholders due to thin trading.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure and Business Operations\nThe Colony NorthStar Merger\nAt the closing of the Mergers, we assumed liabilities and obligations of NSAM, Colony and NRF.\nIn connection with the Mergers, we assumed the liabilities and obligations of NSAM, Colony and NRF, including NRF\u2019s obligations under its exchangeable senior notes and Colony\u2019s obligations under its convertible notes. These liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business to the extent each of NSAM, Colony and NRF did not identify such liabilities or underestimated the nature, amount or significance, based on amount or otherwise, of such liabilities.\nWe may be unable to retain necessary NSAM, Colony and/or NRF personnel.\nThe success of the Mergers depends on our ability to retain the key employees previously employed by NSAM, Colony and/or NRF. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain us. If key employees terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of employees are retained to maintain effective operations, our business activities may be adversely affected and management\u2019s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating the companies to hiring suitable replacements, all of\nwhich may cause our business to suffer. In addition, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees or to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms. Further, it is expected that certain executive officers previously of NSAM and NRF will depart after providing transition services to us, which may cause our business to be adversely affected.\nGeneral market conditions and unpredictable factors could adversely affect market prices of our preferred stock following the exchange for Colony preferred stock and NRF preferred stock in connection with the Mergers.\nThere can be no assurance about the market prices of our preferred stock that was exchanged for Colony preferred stock and NRF preferred stock, as applicable, in connection with the Mergers. A number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, could influence the future market prices of our preferred stock, including:\n\u2022\nwhether we declare or fail to declare dividends on our preferred stock from time to time;\n\u2022\nreal or anticipated changes in the credit ratings assigned to our securities;\n\u2022\nour creditworthiness and credit profile;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the securities, credit and housing markets, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally;\n\u2022\nthe market for similar securities; and\n\u2022\neconomic, corporate, securities market, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events that affect us, the asset management or real estate industries or the financial markets generally.\nShares of our Class A common stock and preferred stock rank junior to all indebtedness of, and other non-equity claims on, our company with respect to assets available to satisfy such claims.\nThomas J. Barrack, Jr., our Executive Chairman, controls a significant number of votes in any matter presented to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors.\nIn connection with the acquisition on April 2, 2015 by Colony\u2019s operating partnership of substantially all of the real estate and investment management businesses and operations of Colony Capital, LLC, or CCLLC, (the \u201cCombination\u201d), Mr. Barrack was issued Colony class B common stock which had additional voting rights. In the Mergers, such Colony class B common stock was exchanged for shares of our Class B Common Stock. Mr. Barrack controls a significant number of votes in matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, as a result of his beneficial ownership of our Class B Common Stock. Mr. Barrack may have interests that differ from our other stockholders and may accordingly vote in ways that may not be consistent with the interests of those other stockholders.\nOur tax protection agreement could limit our ability to sell certain properties, engage in a strategic transaction or reduce our level of indebtedness, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nAt the closing of the Mergers, CCLLC, CCH Management Partners I, LLC, FHB Holding LLC and Richard B. Saltzman, each of which we refer to as a protected member, entered into a tax protection agreement with the Company and the OP, or the TPA. The TPA provides that each protected member is indemnified on an after-tax basis for any Section 704(c) gain, calculated as provided in the TPA, as a result of a transaction occurring during the period commencing on June 3, 2016 and ending on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Mergers and that is considered to be a sale of the tax goodwill or going concern value or airplane owned by the OP and contributed (directly or indirectly) by such protected members, which we refer to, collectively, as the protected property, other than on transfers to the protected members or persons or entities related to the protected members. The TPA also applies to a merger or other transaction that would convert interests in the OP held by the protected members to cash or otherwise result in a taxable disposition of such interests, but does not apply to a transaction in which the equity interests of the protected members are maintained in a manner that does not trigger gain or offers the protected members the option to roll over their investment into an equity interest that is substantially equivalent (including value, profit and loss share, distribution rights and liquidity) to the equity interests exchanged in such transaction.\nIf our tax indemnification obligations are triggered under these agreements, we will be required to pay damages for the resulting tax consequences to the protected members and the calculation of damages will not be based on the time value of money or the time remaining within the restricted period. Moreover, these obligations may restrict our ability to engage in a strategic transaction. In addition, these obligations may require us to maintain more or different indebtedness than we would otherwise require for our business. The OP estimates that if all of its assets subject to the TPA are sold in a taxable transaction, its indemnification obligations (based on tax rates applicable for the taxable year ended December 31, 2016 and exchange values and including additional payments to compensate the protected members for additional tax liabilities resulting from the indemnification payments) would be approximately $410 million.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe have and may continue to enter into strategic partnerships and joint ventures to support the significant growth of our business. We may also make investments in partnerships or other co-ownership arrangements or participations with third parties. In connection with our investments, our partners provide, among other things, property management, investment advisory, sub-advisory and other services to us and certain of the companies that we manage. We may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of our strategic partnerships and joint ventures. Such investments and any future strategic partnerships and/or joint ventures subject us and the companies we manage to risks and uncertainties not otherwise present with other methods of investment. In addition, the controlling partner(s) may be able to take actions which are not in our best interests or the best interests of the investments we manage because of our lack of full control. Furthermore, to the extent that our joint venture partner provides services to the companies we manage, certain conflicts of interest will exist. Any of the above might subject us to liabilities and thus reduce our returns on our investment with that joint venture partner. In addition, disagreements or disputes between us and our joint venture partner could result in litigation, which could increase our expenses and potentially limit the time and effort our officers and directors are able to devote to our business.\nRisks Related to Our Incorporation in Maryland\nThe stock ownership limits imposed by the Code for REITs and our Charter may restrict our business combination opportunities.\nIn order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year following our first year. Our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, or the Charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our board of directors to take those actions that are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. In order to assist us in complying with the limitations on the concentration of ownership of REIT stock imposed by the Code, our Charter generally prohibits any person (other than a person who has been granted an exemption) from actually or constructively owning more than 9.8% of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our capital stock (as defined in our Charter) by value or 9.8% of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock (as defined in our Charter) by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive. Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, grant an exemption to the ownership limits, subject to certain conditions and the receipt by our board of directors of certain representations and undertakings. The ownership limits imposed under the Code are based upon direct or indirect ownership by \u201cindividuals,\u201d but only during the last half of a tax year. The ownership limits contained in our Charter key off of the ownership at any time by any \u201cperson,\u201d which term includes entities. These ownership limitations are common in REIT charters and are intended to provide added assurance of compliance with the tax law requirements, and to minimize administrative burdens. However, the ownership limit on our common stock might also delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders, and the proposed reduction in the ownership limit could further restrict such transactions that may otherwise not be so delayed or prevented.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or impeding a change of control that could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\n\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock), or an affiliate thereof, for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights and supermajority voting requirements on these combinations; and\n\u2022\n\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that holders of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of our company (defined as voting shares which, when aggregated with all other shares owned or controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding \u201ccontrol shares\u201d) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nThe statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d becomes an interested stockholder. Our board of directors has, by resolution, exempted any business combination between us and any person who is an existing, or becomes in the future, an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d provided that any such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of the directors of our company who are not affiliates or associates of such person). Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and any such person. As a result, such person may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without\ncompliance with the supermajority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute. Additionally, this resolution may be altered, revoked, or repealed in whole or in part at any time and we may opt back into the business combination provisions of the MGCL. If this resolution is revoked or repealed, the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer. In the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL, we have elected to opt out of these provisions of the MGCL pursuant to a provision in our bylaws.\nConflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future with the OP and its members, which may impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders.\nConflicts of interest may exist or could arise as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and the OP or any member thereof, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to our Company and our stockholders under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our Company. At the same time, Colony NorthStar, as sole managing member of the OP, has fiduciary duties to the OP and to its members under Delaware law in connection with the management of the OP. Our duties to the OP and its members, as the sole managing member may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our Company and our stockholders. These conflicts may be resolved in a manner that is not in the best interest of our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Managed Vehicles\nChanges in investor preferences or market conditions could limit our ability to raise capital or make new investments on behalf of the companies that we manage.\nIn order to raise capital on behalf of our managed vehicles, we have relied on (i) sales of the publicly-registered, non-traded securities issued by our Retail Companies sold to individual investors through participating selected dealers and (ii) private placements of limited partner or similar interests in our managed vehicles. With respect to our Retail Companies, we have partnerships with a diversified group of selected dealers raising capital for our managed companies, however certain of our managed companies have raised a material amount of funds from a concentrated number of selected dealers. If our traditional channels for raising non-traded securities were to become less available as a result of a changes in market receptivity to illiquid investments with similar fee or compensation structures, regulatory scrutiny, or other reasons, our ability to raise capital and make investments on behalf of our Retail Companies could be adversely affected.\nPoor performance of our managed vehicles or our future managed vehicles could cause a decline in our revenue, income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nIn the event that any of our managed vehicles or our future managed vehicles were to perform poorly, our revenue, income and cash flow could decline because the value of our assets under management would decrease, which, depending on the terms of the applicable vehicle, could result in a reduction in investment management and other fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the carried interest and/or other incentive fees we earn. Moreover, we could experience losses on our investments of our own principal as a result of poor investment performance by our managed vehicles.\nInvestors in our future managed vehicles may negotiate to pay us lower investment management and other fees and the economic terms of our future managed vehicles may be less favorable to us than those of managed vehicles we currently manage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with raising new managed vehicles or securing additional investments in existing managed vehicles, we will negotiate terms for such managed vehicles and investments with investors. The outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than the terms of the managed vehicles or managed vehicles advised by our competitors. For example such terms could restrict our ability to raise managed vehicles with investment objectives or strategies that compete with existing managed vehicles, reduce fee revenues we earn, reduce the percentage of profits on third-party capital in which we share, include a performance hurdle that requires us to generate a specified return on investment prior to our right to receive carried interest or add expenses and obligations for us in managing the vehicles or increase our potential liabilities. Furthermore, as institutional investors increasingly consolidate their relationships with investment firms and competition becomes more acute, we may receive more of these requests to modify the terms in our new managed vehicles. Agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us could result in a decrease in our profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause certain of the management agreements with the companies that we manage that raise capital through the retail market, or our Retail Companies, are subject to limitation or cancellation, any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe agreements under which we provide management and other services to our Retail Companies are renewable upon mutual consent of the parties for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods. These agreements may generally be terminated by each Retail Company immediately for cause, or upon 60 days\u2019 written notice, without cause or for good reason, and expire on an annual basis, unless otherwise renewed. Further, we anticipate that our Retail Companies will pursue a liquidity transaction\nin the future and, if successful, certain liquidity transactions could result in termination or expiration of these agreements. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not expire or be terminated. Any such termination or expiration could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with sponsoring, investing in and managing new managed vehicles.\nWe sponsor, manage and serve as general partner and/or manager of new managed vehicles. Investment in these managed vehicles may involve risks not otherwise present with a direct investment in such managed vehicle\u2019s target investments, including, for example:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that investors might become bankrupt or otherwise be unable to meet their capital contribution obligations;\n\u2022\nthat operating and/ or management agreements of a managed vehicle often restrict our ability to transfer or liquidate our interest when we desire or on advantageous terms;\n\u2022\nthat our relationships with the investors will be generally contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements, or we may be removed as general partner and manager, and in such event, we may not continue to manage or invest in the applicable managed vehicle underlying such relationships;\n\u2022\nthat disputes between us and the investors may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the investments owned by the applicable managed vehicle to additional risk; and\n\u2022\nthat we may incur liability for obligations of a managed vehicle by reason of being its general partner or manager.\nValuation methodologies for certain assets in our managed vehicles can involve subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect, which could result in the misstatement of performance and accrued performance fees of a managed vehicle.\nThere are often no readily ascertainable market prices for a substantial majority of illiquid investments of our managed vehicles. We determine the fair value of the investments of each of our managed vehicles at least quarterly based on the fair value guidelines set forth by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework that ranks the observability of market inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nInvestments for which market prices are not observable include, but are not limited to illiquid investments in operating companies, real estate, energy ventures and structured vehicles, and encompass all components of the capital structure, including equity, mezzanine, debt, preferred equity and derivative instruments such as options and warrants. Fair values of such investments are determined by reference to the market approach (i.e., multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company or asset, such as EBITDA, by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable public entities or transactions, adjusted by management as appropriate for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables), the income approach (i.e., discounting projected future cash flows of the investee company or asset and/or capitalizing representative stabilized cash flows of the investee company or asset) and other methodologies such as prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services, option pricing models and replacement costs.\nThe determination of fair value using these methodologies takes into consideration a range of factors including but not limited to the price at which the investment was acquired, the nature of the investment, local market conditions, the multiples of comparable securities, current and projected operating performance and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of management judgment. For example, as to investments that we share with another sponsor, we may apply a different valuation methodology than the other sponsor does or derive a different value than the other sponsor has derived on the same investment, which could cause some investors to question our valuations.\nBecause there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in a managed vehicle\u2019s net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would be obtained by us on behalf of the managed vehicle when such investments are realized. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior managed vehicle net asset values would result in reduced earnings or losses for the applicable managed vehicle, the loss of potential carried interest and incentive fees and in the case of our hedge funds, management fees. Changes in values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in the net asset values and results of operations that we report from period to period. Also, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in prior managed vehicle net asset values could cause investors to lose confidence in us, which could in turn result in difficulty in raising additional managed vehicles.\nSEC rules barring so-called \u201cbad actors\u201d from relying on Rule 506 of Regulation D in private placements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRules 501 and 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act bar issuers where the issuer is or the offering would involve a \u201cbad actor\u201d from relying on Rule 506 of Regulation D, or Rule 506 in connection with private placements (the \u201cdisqualification rule\u201d). Specifically, an issuer will be precluded from conducting offerings that rely on the exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 506, or Rule 506 offerings if a \u201ccovered person\u201d of the issuer has been the subject of a \u201cdisqualifying event\u201d (each as defined below). \u201cCovered persons\u201d include, among others, the issuer, affiliated issuers, any investment manager or solicitor of the issuer, any director, executive officer or other officer participating in the offering of the issuer, any general partner or managing member of the foregoing entities, any promoter of the issuer and any beneficial owner of 20% or more of the issuer\u2019s outstanding voting equity securities, calculated on the basis of voting power. A \u201cdisqualifying event\u201d includes, among other things, certain (i) criminal convictions and court injunctions and restraining orders issued in connection with the purchase or sale of a security or false filings with the SEC; (ii) final orders from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, federal banking agencies and certain other regulators that bar a person from associating with a regulated entity or engaging in the business of securities, insurance or banking or that are based on certain fraudulent conduct; (iii) SEC disciplinary orders relating to investment advisers, brokers, dealers and their associated persons; (iv) SEC cease-and-desist orders relating to violations of certain anti- fraud provisions and registration requirements of the federal securities laws; (v) suspensions or expulsions from membership in a self-regulatory organization, or SRO or from association with an SRO member; and (vi) U.S. Postal Service false representation orders.\nIf any covered person is subject to a disqualifying event, one or more of our private funds could lose the ability to raise capital in a Rule 506 offering for a significant period of time. Certain of our private funds rely on Rule 506 to raise capital from investors during their fundraising periods. If one or more of our private funds were to lose the ability to rely on the Rule 506 exemption because a covered person has been the subject of a disqualifying event, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nMisconduct by third-party selling broker-dealers or our broker-dealer sales force could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on selling broker-dealers and our broker-dealer sales force to properly offer equity in our current and future Retail Companies to investors in compliance with our selling agreements and with applicable regulatory requirements. While these persons are responsible for their activities as registered broker-dealers, their actions may nonetheless result in complaints or legal or regulatory action against us. These actions could also directly or indirectly harm the industry generally or our reputation specifically, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we may have indemnification obligations under certain selling agreements and dealer agreements for misconduct by such broker-dealers, such indemnification may not fully cover our losses and any such shortfall or delay in receiving any indemnification proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe organization and management of our Retail Companies and any future Retail Companies we may manage may create conflicts of interest.\nWe currently manage, and may in the future manage, REITs and other entities that have investment and/or rate of return objectives similar to our own. Those entities may be in competition with us with respect to properties, potential purchasers, sellers and lessees of properties, and mortgage financing opportunities. We have agreed to implement certain procedures to help manage any perceived or actual conflicts among us and the Retail Companies, including the following:\n\u2022\nallocating funds based on numerous factors, including investment objectives, available cash, diversification/concentration, leverage policy, the size of the investment, tax, anticipated pipeline of suitable investments and fund life;\n\u2022\nall transactions where we co-invest with a Retail Company are subject to the approval of the independent directors of the applicable Retail Company;\n\u2022\ninvestment allocations are reviewed as part of the annual advisory contract renewal process of each Retail Company; and\n\u2022\nquarterly review of all of the investment activities of the Retail Company by the independent directors of the Retail Company.\nIn addition, subject to compliance with Investment Advisers Act rules, we may allow our managed vehicle to enter into principal transactions with us or cross-transactions with other managed vehicles or strategic vehicles. For certain cross-transactions, we may receive a fee from the managed company and conflicts may exist. If our interests and those of the 84% interest in Townsend Holdings, LLC that NSAM acquired on January 29, 2016, or Townsend, or our managed vehicles are not aligned, we may face conflicts of interests that result in action or inaction that is detrimental to us, our managed vehicles, our strategic partnerships or our joint ventures.\nAppropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest would have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which would materially adversely affect our business and our ability to attract investors for future vehicles.\nConflicts of interest may also arise in the allocation of fees and costs among our managed vehicles that we incur in connection with the management of their assets. This allocation sometimes requires us to exercise discretion and there is no guarantee that we will allocate these fees and costs appropriately.\nIn addition to the management fees we receive from our managed vehicles, we are reimbursed by our Retail Companies for costs and expenses we incur on their behalf, including indirect personnel and employment costs that we allocate to our Retail Companies and disputes could arise in connection with those allocations.\nWe are paid substantial fees for the services we and our subsidiaries provide to our managed vehicles and we are also reimbursed by our Retail Companies for costs and expenses we incur and pay on their behalf. Our Retail Companies reimburse us, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, for both direct expenses as well as indirect costs, including our personnel and employment costs. The costs and expenses that we allocate to our Retail Companies can be substantial and may involve subjective judgment and discretion. There are conflicts of interest that arise when we make allocation determinations. These conflicts of interest, as well as the loyalties of our executives and other real estate and finance professionals to other entities and investors, could result in action or inaction that is detrimental to our business, which could harm the implementation of our business strategy and our reputation. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we allocated $2.2 million and $32.6 million in costs to NRF and NorthStar Europe and our Retail Companies, respectively. Our Retail Companies could dispute the amount of costs we allocate to them and the methodologies we use to determine those amounts. Any dispute or investigation regarding our allocation of costs and expenses could be distracting, expensive and harmful to our reputation as well as have other adverse effects on our company and future operating performance, including the potential that our Retail Companies could seek to terminate their relationship with us.\nThe adoption by the U.S. Department of Labor, or DOL, of certain amendments to the definition of \u201cfiduciary\u201d under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, could adversely affect our ability to raise capital through public offerings of our Retail Companies.\nIn 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor, or DOL, adopted certain amendments to the definition of \u201cfiduciary\u201d under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The proposed amendments have broadened the definition of \u201cfiduciary\u201d and made a number of changes to the prohibited transaction exemptions relating to investments by employee benefit plans subject to Title I of ERISA or retirement plans or accounts subject to Section 4975 of the Code (including individual retirement accounts, or IRAs). The amendments became effective in 2016, with implementation commencing in April 2017 and continuing through January 2018. On February 3, 2017, a Presidential Memorandum was issued directing the Department of Labor to, among other things, examine the fiduciary duty rule to determine whether it may adversely affect the ability of Americans to gain access to market information and financial advice. The outcome of this review by the DOL and ultimate impact of the amendments are not yet known, but if the amendments are implemented, they, could negatively impact our ability to raise funds through public offerings of our Retail Companies and our operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-traded companies have been the subject of increased scrutiny by regulators and media outlets resulting from inquires and investigations initiated by FINRA and the SEC and could also become the subject of scrutiny and face difficulties in raising capital should negative perceptions develop regarding non-traded REITs. As a result, our non-traded Sponsored Companies may be unable to raise substantial funds which will limit the number and type of investments they may make and their ability to diversify their assets.\nIn February 2014, Apple REIT Six, Inc., Apple REIT Seven, Inc., Apple REIT Eight, Inc. and Apple REIT Nine, Inc., each of their external advisors and the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of each of the REITs entered into a cease and desist order with the SEC and agreed to pay approximately $1.5 million in civil fines in the aggregate. Although the respondents did not admit or deny any wrongdoing, the cease and desist order stated that the REITs made material misrepresentations regarding the valuation of the securities sold through their dividend reinvestment plans, had failed to maintain sufficient disclosure controls and procedures to meaningfully evaluate whether the value of the securities had changed, failed to disclose numerous related party transactions and failed to disclose significant compensation paid by the advisors to the REITs and by the founder to the executive officers of the REITs. The above-referenced proceedings and related matters have resulted in increased regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, FINRA and state regulators regarding non-traded companies. In addition, certain non-traded REIT sponsors have recently been the subject of Federal investigations, as widely reported in the press. The increased media attention and negative publicity surrounding these matters may adversely impact capital raising in the non-traded REIT industry. Furthermore, amendments to FINRA rules regarding customer account statements were approved by the SEC and became effective on April 11, 2016. These amendments have significantly affected the manner in which non-traded companies raise capital and may have contributed to a significant reduction in capital raised by non-traded companies. In addition, recent amendments adopted by the DOL to fiduciary\nand other standards on sales practices of broker-dealers and the impact of such rules, if implemented, could adversely affect the ability of our Sponsored Companies to raise additional capital.\nAs a result of this increased scrutiny and accompanying negative publicity and coverage by media outlets, FINRA may impose additional restrictions on sales practices in the independent broker-dealer channel for non-traded companies, and accordingly the non-traded companies we manage may face increased difficulties in raising capital in their offerings. Should these companies be unable to raise substantial funds in their offerings, the number and type of investments they may make will be curtailed, all of which could materially adversely affect the fee income generated from our broker-dealer that acts as the dealer manager of these offerings as well as the asset management and other fees we earn and the nature of the transactions undertaken by the non-traded companies we manage which would adversely affect our ability to grow our business. If we or the non-traded companies we manage become the subject of scrutiny, even if we have complied with all applicable laws and regulations, responding to such scrutiny could be expensive, harmful to our reputation and distracting to our management.\nThe implementation of changes to investor account statements for the Managed Programs described in Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, Regulatory Notice 15-02 may impact our ability to raise funds on behalf of the Managed Programs.\nAs described in FINRA Regulatory Notice 15-02, amendments to FINRA Rule 2310 and National Association of Securities Dealers Rule 2340 enacted in April 2016 have, among other things, required investor account statements for unlisted REITs, including the Retail Companies, to reflect an estimated value per share (as determined based on either the net investment method or appraised value method). The rule changes also required that account statements include additional disclosure regarding the sources of distributions to shareholders of unlisted entities. The implementation of these rules could continue to adversely affect market demand for shares of unlisted REITs and unlisted Business Development Company, or BDCs, and non-traded closed end funds, and impact our ability to raise funds on behalf of the Retail Companies through their public offerings, which could in turn affect their operations and the fees we earn by serving as their advisor, impacting our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industrial Business\nOur ownership of industrial properties is subject to various risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur ownership of industrial properties subjects us to various risks that could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nan economic downturn in the industrial real estate sector;\n\u2022\nenvironmentally hazardous conditions, including the presence of or proximity to underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous toxic substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, and the resulting potential for release of such products and substances, which may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such properties as collateral for future borrowings;\n\u2022\nrestrictions imposed by environmental laws on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated; and\n\u2022\nthe risk of liabilities, including under environmental laws and regulations, arising from leasing properties to customers that engage in industrial, manufacturing, and commercial activities that involve hazardous or toxic substances.\nAny of the foregoing risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nWe are not required to meet any diversification standards; therefore, our investments may become subject to concentration risks.\nSubject to our intention to maintain our qualification as a REIT, there are no limitations on the number or value of particular types of investments that we may make. We are not required to meet any diversification standards, including geographic diversification standards. Therefore, our investments may become concentrated in type or geographic location, which could subject us to significant concentration risks with potentially adverse effects on our investment objectives.\nRisks Related to Our Healthcare Business\nApproximately 45.8% of our real estate investments are concentrated in healthcare properties, which increases the likelihood of risks related to owning healthcare real estate properties becoming more material to our business and results of operations.\nHealthcare real estate properties currently represent approximately 45.8% of our real estate portfolio. As a result of this concentration of healthcare real estate properties, our exposure to the risks inherent in investments in the healthcare sector has also increased, making us more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare sector. We cannot be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations\nto us. We also cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the healthcare industry. Any adverse changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry or the competitiveness of our tenants, operators and managers could have a more pronounced effect on us than if our investments were more diversified.\nWe do not control the operations of our healthcare properties and are dependent on the tenants/operators/managers of our healthcare properties.\nOur healthcare properties are typically operated by healthcare operators pursuant to net leases or by an independent third-party manager pursuant to management agreements. As a result, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our healthcare properties. While we have various rights as the property owner under our leases or management agreements and monitor the tenants/operators/managers\u2019 performance, we may have limited recourse under our leases or management agreements if we believe that the tenants/operators/managers are not performing adequately. Failure by the tenants/operators/managers to adequately manage the risks associated with operations of healthcare properties could affect adversely our results of operations. Furthermore, if our tenants/operators/managers experience any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are directly exposed to operational risks at certain of our healthcare properties, which could adversely affect our revenue and operations.\nUpon completion of the Mergers, we operated 112 properties pursuant to management agreements, whereby we are directly exposed to various operational risks with respect to these healthcare properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, government reimbursement, if applicable, private pay rates, economic conditions, competition, federal, state, local and industry-regulated licensure, certification, fraud and abuse and privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage, and the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise). Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. Refer to \u201cRegulation - Healthcare Regulation\u201d included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nDecreases in our tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 revenues or increases in our tenants and operators\u2019 expenses could affect our tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 ability to make payments to us.\nOur tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable. Expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement may continue to be subject to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Operating costs continue to increase for our tenants and operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our tenants or operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To the extent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record an impairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results.\nIncreased competition may affect our tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to us.\nThe tenants and operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other healthcare providers that provide comparable services. We cannot be certain that the tenants and operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Our tenants and operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses.\nFailure to comply with certain healthcare laws and regulations could adversely affect the operations of our tenants/operators/managers, which could jeopardize our tenants/operators/managers\u2019 abilities to meet their obligations to us.\nOur tenants, operators and managers generally are subject to varying levels of federal, state, local, and industry-regulated laws, regulations and standards. Our tenants/operators/managers\u2019 failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or standards could result in denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, penalties or damages, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, loss of license, loss of accreditation or certification, or closure of the facility. Such actions may have an effect on our tenants\u2019 or operators\u2019 ability to make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. Refer to \u201cRegulation - Healthcare Regulation\u201d included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nChanges in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators and on us.\nCertain of our tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. Federal and state legislators and healthcare financing authorities have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers and some states have declined to expand Medicaid participation under the ACA and have considered Medicaid rate freezes or cuts. See \u201cRegulation-Healthcare Regulation\u201d\nincluded in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. We cannot assure you that our tenants and operators who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. Significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees, whether from legislation, administrative actions or private payor efforts, could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us.\nCurrent efforts by Congress and the new presidential administration to repeal and replace the ACA in total or in part and reform Medicare and Medicaid could negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us.\nThe ACA remains subject to continuing and increasing legislative scrutiny, including current efforts by Congress and the new presidential administration to repeal and replace the ACA in total or in part. If the ACA is repealed or substantially modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are suspended, such action could negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us. Additionally, Congress is contemplating substantial reforms to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Refer to \u201cRegulation - Healthcare Regulation\u201d included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. More generally, and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for healthcare products and services, and in light of the current legislative environment, existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our business or that of our tenants and operators.\nEvents that adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford resident fees at our seniors housing facilities could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline.\nCosts to seniors associated with independent and assisted living services are generally not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our facilities are located typically will be able to afford to pay the entrance fees and monthly resident fees, and a weak economy, depressed housing market or changes in demographics could adversely affect their continued ability to do so. If our tenants and operators are unable to retain and attract seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with independent and assisted living services and other services provided by our tenants and operators at our healthcare facilities, our occupancy rates and resident fee revenues could decline, which could, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to stockholders.\nThe hospitals on or near whose campuses many of our medical office buildings, or MOBs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our MOBs.\nOur MOB operations depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our MOBs are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our MOBs. The viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential. Because we rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our MOBs, a hospital\u2019s inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our MOB operations and have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Related to Our Hospitality Business\nApproximately 32.2% of our real estate investments are concentrated in hotels, which increases our exposure to risks affecting the hospitality industry.\nHotels represent approximately 32.2% of our real estate portfolio. The hospitality industry is subject to changes in the travel patterns of business and leisure travelers, both of which are affected by the strength of the economy, as well as other factors. The performance of the hospitality industry has traditionally been closely linked with the performance of the general economy and, specifically, growth in gross domestic product. Changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers, particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term and adversely affect our results. The majority of our hotels are classified as upscale extended stay and upscale select service that generally target business travelers. In periods of economic difficulties, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce costs on their trips. Our results of operations and any forecast we make may be affected by, and can change based on, a variety of circumstances that affect the hospitality industry, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the international, national, regional and local economic climate;\n\u2022\nchanges in business and leisure travel patterns;\n\u2022\nincreases in energy prices or airline fares or terrorist incidents, which impact the propensity of people to travel and revenues from our hospitality facilities because operating costs cannot be adjusted as quickly;\n\u2022\nsupply growth in markets where we own hotels, which may adversely affect demand at our properties;\n\u2022\nthe attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to competing hotels;\n\u2022\nthe performance of the managers of our hotels;\n\u2022\noutbreaks of disease and the impact on travel of natural disasters and weather;\n\u2022\nphysical damage to our hotels as a result of earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural disasters or the income lost as a result of the damage;\n\u2022\nchanges in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation, labor costs and other factors; and\n\u2022\nunionization of the labor force at our hotels.\nA reduction in our revenue or earnings as a result of the above risks may reduce our working capital, impact our long-term business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements.\nWe do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels.\nTo maintain our status as a REIT, we are not permitted to operate any of our hotels. As a result, we have entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotel properties. For this reason, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels, such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates, negotiation of corporate client contracts, food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters. Although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans, the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters. While we monitor the hotel managers\u2019 performance, we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately. The cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain the hotels in an acceptable condition.\nFrom time to time, we may have differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements. If we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution. Failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations, including cyber-security risks, could affect adversely our results of operations.\nIn addition, our hotel managers or their affiliates manage, and in some cases own, have invested in, or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels, all of which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, our hotel managers have in the past made, and may in the future make, decisions regarding competing hospitality facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest.\nIsland Hospitality Group, Inc., or Island manages hotels pursuant to management agreements. Although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on Island\u2019s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our hotel operations efficiently and effectively. Any adverse developments in Island\u2019s business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a materially adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.\nOur third-party managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. Although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our hotels, we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly at those hotels with unionized labor. From time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity. We also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes involving our third-party managers and their labor force or other events. The resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, a significant component of our hotel operating costs, either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. As we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement, we do not negotiate with any labor organization, and it is the responsibility of each property\u2019s manager to enter into such labor contracts. Our ability, if any, to have any material impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific property and we may have little ability to control the outcome of these negotiations.\nIn addition, changes in labor laws may negatively impact us. For example, increases in minimum wage laws and the DOL\u2019s proposed regulations expanding the scope of non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act to increase the entitlement\nto overtime pay could significantly increase the cost of labor in the workforce, which would increase the operating costs of our hotel properties and may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our ongoing need for renovations and capital improvements as well as financing these expenditures.\nIn order to remain competitive, our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements, including replacements, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. These capital improvements may give rise to the following risks:\n\u2022\nconstruction cost overruns and delays;\n\u2022\na possible shortage of liquidity to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing for these capital improvements may not be available to us on affordable terms;\n\u2022\nthe renovation investment failing to produce the returns on investment that we expect;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the operations of the hotel as well as in demand for the hotel while capital improvements are underway; and\n\u2022\ndisputes with franchisors or hotel managers regarding compliance with relevant management or franchise agreements.\nWe may have insufficient liquidity to fund capital expenditures and, consequently, we may need to rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund our investments and capital improvements. These sources of funds may not be available on reasonable terms and conditions or at all.\nRisks of operating hotels under franchise licenses, which may be terminated or not renewed, may impact our ability to make distributions to stockholders.\nThe continuation of our franchise licenses is subject to specified operating standards and other terms and conditions. All of the franchisors of our hotels periodically inspect our hotels to confirm adherence to their operating standards. The failure to maintain such standards or to adhere to such other terms and conditions could result in the loss or cancellation of the applicable franchise license. It is possible that a franchisor could condition the continuation of a franchise license on the completion of capital improvements that we determine are too expensive or otherwise not economically feasible in light of general economic conditions, the operating results or prospects of the affected hotel. In that event, we may elect to allow the franchise license to lapse or be terminated.\nThere can be no assurance that a franchisor will renew a franchise license at each option period. If a franchisor terminates a franchise license, we may be unable to obtain a suitable replacement franchise, or to successfully operate the hotel independent of a franchise license. The loss of a franchise license could have a material adverse effect upon the operations or the underlying value of the related hotel because of the loss of associated name recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the franchisor. Our loss of a franchise license for one or more of the hotels could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our amounts available for distribution to shareholders.\nRisks Related to Our Other Equity and Debt Business\nOur commercial real estate equity, debt and mortgage loans underlying our commercial real estate securities investments are subject to the risks typically associated with CRE.\nOur CRE equity, debt and securities investments are subject to the risks typically associated with real estate, including:\n\u2022\nlocal, state, national or international economic conditions;\n\u2022\nreal estate conditions, such as an oversupply of or a reduction in demand for real estate space in an area;\n\u2022\nlack of liquidity inherent in the nature of the asset;\n\u2022\ntenant/operator mix and the success of the tenant/operator business;\n\u2022\nthe ability and willingness of tenants/operators/managers to maintain the financial strength and liquidity to satisfy their obligations to us and to third parties;\n\u2022\nreliance on tenants/operators/managers to operate their business in a sufficient manner and in compliance with their contractual arrangements with us;\n\u2022\nability and cost to replace a tenant/operator/manager upon default;\n\u2022\nproperty management decisions;\n\u2022\nproperty operating costs, including insurance premiums, real estate taxes and maintenance costs;\n\u2022\nthe perceptions of the quality, convenience, attractiveness and safety of the properties;\n\u2022\nbranding, marketing and operational strategies;\n\u2022\ncompetition from comparable properties;\n\u2022\nthe occupancy rate of, and the rental rates charged at, the properties;\n\u2022\nthe ability to collect on a timely basis all rent;\n\u2022\nthe effects of any bankruptcies or insolvencies;\n\u2022\nthe expense of leasing, renovation or construction;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of mortgage financing;\n\u2022\nunknown liens being placed on the properties;\n\u2022\nbad acts of third parties;\n\u2022\nthe ability to refinance mortgage notes payable related to the real estate on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies;\n\u2022\ntax implications;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws, including laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged;\n\u2022\nthe impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws, including costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions affecting properties;\n\u2022\ncost of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies;\n\u2022\nsocial unrest and civil disturbances;\n\u2022\nacts of nature, including earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nterrorism;\n\u2022\nthe potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in state and local laws, including zoning laws; and\n\u2022\nother factors which are beyond our control.\nThe value of each property is affected significantly by its ability to generate cash flow and net income, which in turn depends on the amount of rental or other income that can be generated net of expenses required to be incurred with respect to the property. Many expenses associated with properties (such as operating expenses and capital expenses) cannot be reduced when there is a reduction in income from the properties. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the value and the return that we can realize from our assets, as well as ability of our borrowers to pay their loans and the ability of the borrowers on the underlying loans securing our securities to pay their loans.\nOur existing mezzanine loan assets and those that we may originate or acquire in the future are subject to greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties.\nWe currently own interests in mezzanine loans and may, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, originate or acquire additional mezzanine loans (or interests in mezzanine loans). Mezzanine loans take the form of subordinated loans secured by junior participations in mortgages or second mortgages on the underlying property, or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. These types of assets involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may be foreclosed on by the senior lender. In addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid in full. Where debt senior to our loan exists, the presence of intercreditor arrangements between the holder of the senior mortgage loan and us, as the mezzanine lender, may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loans, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our investment, which could result in losses. In addition, even if we are able to foreclose on the underlying collateral following a default on a mezzanine loan, we would replace the defaulting borrower and, to the extent income generated on the underlying property is insufficient to meet outstanding debt\nobligations on the property, we may need to commit substantial additional capital to stabilize the property and prevent additional defaults to lenders with remaining liens on the property. Significant losses related to our current or future mezzanine loans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nRegulatory Risks\nFailure to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act could require us to register as an investment company or substantially change the way we conduct our business, either of which may have an adverse effect on us and the market price for shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe intend to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Maintenance of the applicable exemptions requires that we subject our business to certain limitations on investment and activities.\nContinuing qualification for exemption from registration under the 1940 Act will limit our ability to make certain investments. For example, for our subsidiaries that rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, the requirements to maintain the exemption will limit their ability to invest directly in mortgage-backed securities that represent less than the entire ownership in a pool of mortgage loans, debt and equity tranches of securitizations and certain asset-backed securities and real estate companies or assets not related to real estate.\nWe classify our investments for purposes of testing for these exemptions based in large measure on no-action letters issued by the Staff of the SEC and other SEC interpretive guidance. These positions were based upon facts that may be different from ours, and many of these no-action positions were issued more than twenty years ago. To the extent that the Staff of the Division of Investment Management of the SEC provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon any exemption on which we may rely, we may be required to adjust our holdings and strategies accordingly. Additional guidance from the Staff of the Division of Investment Management of the SEC could provide us with additional flexibility, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue strategies we have chosen. For example, on August 31, 2011, the SEC issued a concept release (Release No. 29778, File No. S7-34-11, Companies Engaged in the Business of Acquiring Mortgages and Mortgage Related Instruments), pursuant to which it is reviewing whether certain companies that invest in mortgage-backed securities should continue to be allowed to rely on the exclusion from registration under Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act. If the SEC takes action with respect to this exclusion, these changes could result in our CDOs and other subsidiaries being no longer able to rely on the exclusion from registration under Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act. In such a case, we would either need to conform its activities to one or more other exemptions from the 1940 Act or lose our status as exempt from registration under the 1940 Act, either of which could result in an adverse effect on us.\nIf we fail to maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act, either because of changes in SEC guidance or otherwise, we could be required to, among other things: (i) substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company under the 1940Act; or (ii) register as an investment company. Either of (i) or (ii) could have an adverse effect on us and the market price for shares of our Class A common stock. If we are required to register as an investment company under the 1940Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration and other matters.\nRegulation of a subsidiary of our company under the Investment Advisers Act subjects us to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions.\nWe have subsidiaries that are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act. As a result, we are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions that apply to our relationships with our managed vehicles. These provisions and duties impose restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our managed vehicle investors and our investments, including, for example, restrictions on agency, cross and principal transactions. We or our registered investment adviser subsidiaries will be subject to periodic SEC examinations and other requirements under the Investment Advisers Act and related regulations primarily intended to benefit advisory clients. These additional requirements relate to, among other things, maintaining an effective and comprehensive compliance program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements and disclosure requirements. The Investment Advisers Act generally grants the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting advisory activities in the event it fails to comply with federal securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements under the Investment Advisers Act include the prohibition of individuals from associating with an investment adviser, the revocation of registrations and other censures and fines.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nOur qualification as a REIT involves complying with highly technical and complex provisions of the Code.\nOur qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Furthermore, we own direct or indirect interests in a number of entities that have elected (or intend to elect with the filing of their tax return) to be taxed as REITs under the U.S. federal income tax laws, each a Subsidiary REIT. Each Subsidiary REIT also is subject to the various REIT qualification requirements and other limitations described herein that are applicable to us. If a Subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then (i) that Subsidiary REIT would become subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax, (ii) our interest in such Subsidiary REIT would cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs, and (iii) it is possible that we would fail certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs, in which event we also would fail to qualify as a REIT unless we could avail ourselves of certain relief provisions. New legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. Certain rules applicable to REITs are particularly difficult to interpret or to apply in the case of REITs investing in real estate mortgage loans that are acquired at a discount, subject to work-outs or modifications, or reasonably expected to be in default at the time of acquisition. In addition, our ability to satisfy the distribution and other requirements to qualify as a REIT depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe may incur adverse tax consequences if Colony or NRF were to have failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes prior to the Mergers.\nIn connection with the closing of the Mergers, each of Colony and NRF received an opinion of counsel to the effect that it qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Code through the time of the Mergers. Neither Colony nor NRF, however, requested a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS that it qualified as a REIT. If, notwithstanding these opinions, Colony\u2019s or NRF\u2019s REIT status for periods prior to the Mergers were successfully challenged, we would face serious adverse tax consequences that would substantially reduce our core funds from operations, or Core FFO, and cash available for distribution, or CAD, including cash available to pay dividends to our stockholders, because:\n\u2022\nColony or NRF, as applicable, would be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax on its net income at regular corporate rates for the years it did not qualify as a REIT (and, for such years, would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income) and we would succeed to the liability for such taxes;\n\u2022\nif we were considered to be a \u201csuccessor\u201d of such entity, we would not be eligible to elect REIT status until the fifth taxable year following the year during which such entity was disqualified, unless it were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions;\n\u2022\neven if we were eligible to elect REIT status, we would be subject to tax (at the highest corporate rate in effect at the date of the sale) on the built-in gain on each asset of Colony or NRF, as applicable, existing at the time of the Mergers if we were to dispose of such asset for up to 5 years following the Mergers; and\n\u2022\nwe would succeed to any earnings and profits accumulated by Colony or NRF, as applicable, for tax periods that such entity did not qualify as a REIT and we would have to pay a special dividend and/or employ applicable deficiency dividend procedures (including interest payments to the IRS) to eliminate such earnings and profits to maintain our REIT qualification.\nAs a result of these factors, Colony\u2019s or NRF\u2019s failure to qualify as a REIT prior to the Mergers could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our stock.\nIn addition, even if they qualify as REITs for the duration of their existence, if there is an adjustment to Colony\u2019s or NRF\u2019s taxable income or dividends paid deductions for periods prior to the Mergers, we could be required to elect to use the deficiency dividend procedure to maintain Colony\u2019s or NRF\u2019s, as applicable, REIT status. That deficiency dividend procedure could require us to make significant distributions to our stockholders and to pay significant interest to the IRS.\nIf the Operating Partnership is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will cease to qualify as a REIT.\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership qualifies as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, it is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income. Instead, its partners, including us, generally are required to pay tax on their respective allocable share of the Operating Partnership\u2019s income. No assurance can be provided, however, that the IRS will not challenge the Operating Partnership\u2019s status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nwe would fail to meet the gross income and asset tests applicable to REITs and, therefore, cease to qualify as a REIT, and the Operating Partnership would become subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. The payment by the Operating Partnership of income tax would reduce significantly the amount of cash available to the Operating Partnership to satisfy obligations to make principal and interest payments on its debt and to make distribution to its partners, including us. In addition, any change in the status of the Operating Partnership for tax purposes might be treated as a taxable event, in which case we might incur a tax liability without any related cash distributions.\nIf we do not qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax and potentially to additional state and local taxes which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nWe have been organized and we intend to operate in a manner that will enable us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2017. We, however, will not request a ruling from the IRS as to our REIT qualification. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we are required to satisfy certain gross income and asset tests. Our ability to satisfy the gross income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis (which, based on the types of assets we own, can fluctuate rapidly, significantly and unpredictably). Moreover, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT qualification requirements as described below. In addition, we will be required to make estimates of or otherwise determine the value of real property that is collateral for our mortgage loan assets. In some cases, the real property will be under construction or the subject of significant improvements, making such collateral even more difficult to value. There can be no assurance that the IRS would not challenge our valuations or valuation estimates of this collateral. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or in securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the REIT requirements.\nIf we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the preferential tax rates available for some dividends.\nDividends payable by REITs generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates on qualified dividend income. Although this does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, to the extent that the preferential rates continue to apply to regular corporate qualified dividends, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our Class A Common Stock.\nREIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order to qualify as a REIT. In addition, to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including any net capital gain), we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. Moreover, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code and to avoid being taxed on our undistributed taxable income.\nFrom time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with U. S. GAAP, or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur. For example, we may be required to accrue income from mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, and other types of debt securities or interests in debt securities before we receive any payments of interest or principal on such assets. We may also acquire distressed debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower. If the amendments to the outstanding debt are \u201csignificant modifications\u201d under the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us at a gain in a debt-for-debt exchange with the borrower, with gain recognized by us to the extent that the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our cost of purchasing it prior to modification.\nAs a result, we may find it difficult or impossible to meet distribution requirements in certain circumstances. In particular, where we experience differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash, the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our taxable income could cause us to: (i) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms, (iii) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt or (iv) make a taxable distribution of our shares of Class A common stock as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive shares of Class A common stock or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution) cash, in order to comply with REIT requirements. These alternatives could increase our costs, reduce our equity, and/or result in stockholders being taxed on distributions of shares of stock without receiving cash sufficient to pay the resulting taxes. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nEven if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.\nEven if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, property and transfer taxes, such as mortgage recording taxes. Moreover, if we have net income from \u201cprohibited transactions,\u201d that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In addition, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We are subject to U.S. federal and state income tax (and any applicable non-U.S. taxes) on the net income earned by our taxable REIT Subsidiaries, or TRSs. Due to the nature of the assets in which we invest, we expect our TRSs will have a material amount of assets and net taxable income. Our TRS may have tax liability with respect to \u201cphantom income\u201d if it is treated as a \u201cdealer\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes which would require the TRS to mark to market its assets at the end of each taxable year. Finally, we have substantial operations and assets outside the U.S. that are subject to tax in those countries. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nWe may recognize substantial amounts of REIT taxable income, which we would be required to distribute to stockholders, in a year in which we are not profitable under U.S. GAAP or other economic measures.\nWe may recognize substantial amounts of REIT taxable income in years in which we are not profitable under U.S. GAAP or other economic measures as a result of the differences between U.S. GAAP and tax accounting methods. For example, we may recognize substantial amounts of COD income for U.S. federal income tax purposes (but not for U.S. GAAP purposes) due to discount repurchases of our liabilities, which could cause our REIT taxable income to exceed our U.S. GAAP income. Additionally, we may deduct our capital losses only to the extent of our capital gains and not against our ordinary income, in computing our REIT taxable income for a given taxable year. Finally, certain of our assets and liabilities are marked-to-market for U.S. GAAP purposes but not for tax purposes, which could result in losses for U.S. GAAP purposes that are not recognized in computing our REIT taxable income. Consequently, we could recognize substantial amounts of REIT taxable income and would be required to distribute such income to stockholders in a year in which we are not profitable under U.S. GAAP or other economic measures.\nWe may distribute our common stock in a taxable distribution, in which case stockholders may sell shares of our common stock to pay tax on such distributions, placing downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.\nIn order to reduce the amount of cash that we are required to distribute to shareholders, we may make taxable distributions that are payable in partly in cash and partly in common stock. The IRS has issued private letter rulings to other REITs treating certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in stock as taxable distributions that would satisfy the REIT annual distribution requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we made a taxable dividend payable in cash and common stock, taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of the dividend, which is treated as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income tax with respect to such distributions in excess of the actual cash distributions received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount recorded in earnings with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock. If we made a taxable dividend payable in cash and our common stock and a significant number of stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.\nComplying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of MBS. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than qualified 75% asset test assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the\nvalue of our assets (other than qualified 75% asset test assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% (20% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets can be represented by stock or securities of one or more TRSs. Debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs, to the extent not secured by real property or interests in real property, qualify for the 75% asset test but the value of such debt instruments cannot exceed 25% of the value of our total assets. Finally, in connection with the Mergers and the prior combination of Colony\u2019s business, we are treated has having acquired substantial amounts of goodwill that may not qualify for the 75% asset test assets and thus will restrict our ability to make other investments that might not qualify for the 75% asset test assets without jeopardizing our ability to satisfy the 75% asset test in the future. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio, or contribute to a TRS, otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income, increasing our income tax liability, and reducing amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. In addition, we may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution, and may be unable to pursue investments (or, in some cases, forego the sale of such investments) that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a REIT. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to make, and, in certain cases, maintain ownership of certain attractive investments.\nThe failure of assets subject to repurchase agreements to qualify as real estate assets could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.\nWe are party to certain financing arrangements, and may in the future enter into additional financing arrangements, that are structured as sale and repurchase agreements pursuant to which we would nominally sell certain of our assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase these assets at a later date in exchange for a purchase price. Economically, these agreements are financings which are secured by the assets sold pursuant thereto. We believe that we would be treated for REIT asset and income test purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such sale and repurchase agreement notwithstanding that such agreements may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in which case we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\nWe may be required to report taxable income for certain investments in excess of the economic income we ultimately realize from them.\nWe own certain debt instruments that were acquired in the secondary market for less than their face amount and may in the future acquire additional debt instruments in the secondary market for less than their face amount. The amount of such discount will generally be treated as \u201cmarket discount\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accrued market discount is reported as income when, and to the extent that, any payment of principal of the debt instrument is made, unless we elect to include accrued market discount in income as it accrues. Principal payments on certain loans are made monthly, and consequently accrued market discount may have to be included in income each month as if the debt instrument were assured of ultimately being collected in full. If we collect less on the debt instrument than our purchase price plus the market discount we had previously reported as income, we may not be able to benefit from any offsetting loss deductions.\nSimilarly, some of the MBS that we acquire may have been issued with original issue discount. We will be required to report such original issue discount based on a constant yield method and will be taxed based on the assumption that all future projected payments due on such MBS will be made. If such MBS turns out not to be fully collectible, an offsetting loss deduction will become available only in the later year that uncollectability is provable.\nIn the event that any debt instruments or MBS acquired by us are delinquent as to mandatory principal and interest payments, or in the event payments with respect to a particular debt instrument are not made when due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income as it accrues, despite doubt as to its ultimate collectability. Similarly, we may be required to accrue interest income with respect to subordinate MBS at its stated rate regardless of whether corresponding cash payments are received or are ultimately collectable. In each case, while we would in general ultimately have an offsetting loss deduction available to us when such interest was determined to be uncollectible, the utility of that deduction could depend on our having taxable income in that later year or thereafter.\nFinally, we or our TRSs may recognize taxable \u201cphantom income\u201d as a result of modifications, pursuant to agreements with borrowers, of debt instruments that we acquire if the amendments to the outstanding debt are \u201csignificant modifications\u201d under the applicable Treasury regulations. In addition, our TRSs may be treated as a \u201cdealer\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case the TRS would be required to mark to market its assets at the end of each taxable year and recognize taxable gain or loss on those assets even though there has been no actual sale of those assets.\nThe \u201ctaxable mortgage pool\u201d rules may increase the taxes that we or our stockholders may incur, and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations.\nSecuritizations by us or our subsidiaries could result in the creation of taxable mortgage pools for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, we could have \u201cexcess inclusion income.\u201d In general, dividend income that a tax-exempt entity receives from us should not constitute unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, as defined in Section 512 of the Code. If we realize excess inclusion income and allocate it to stockholders, however, then this income would be fully taxable as UBTI to a tax-exempt entity under Section 512 of the Code. A foreign stockholder would generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax withholding on this income without reduction pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty. U.S. stockholders would not be able to offset such income with their net operating losses.\nAlthough the law is not entirely clear, the IRS has taken the position that we are subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on the portion of our excess inclusion income equal to the percentage of our stock held in record name by \u201cdisqualified organizations\u201d (generally tax-exempt investors, such as certain state pension plans and charitable remainder trusts, that are not subject to the tax on unrelated business taxable income). To the extent that our stock owned by \u201cdisqualified organizations\u201d is held in street name by a broker-dealer or other nominee, the broker-dealer or nominee would be liable for a tax at the highest corporate rate on the portion of our excess inclusion income allocable to the stock held on behalf of the \u201cdisqualified organizations.\u201d A regulated investment company or other pass-through entity owning our stock may also be subject to tax at the highest corporate tax rate on any excess inclusion income allocated to their record name owners that are \u201cdisqualified organizations.\u201d\nExcess inclusion income could result if a REIT held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit, or REMIC. In addition, excess inclusion income also may be generated if a REIT issues liabilities with two or more maturities and the terms of the payments of these liabilities bear a relationship to the payments that the REIT received on mortgage loans or mortgage-backed securities securing those liabilities. If any portion of our dividends is attributable to excess inclusion income, then the tax liability of tax-exempt stockholders, foreign stockholders, stockholders with net operating losses, regulated investment companies and other pass-through entities whose record name owners are disqualified organizations and brokers-dealers and other nominees who hold stock on behalf of disqualified organizations will very likely increase.\nThe tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing mortgage loans, which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nA REIT\u2019s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including mortgage loans, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We might be subject to this tax if we were to dispose of or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans at the REIT-level, and may limit the structures we utilize for our securitization transactions, even though the sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial to us. We sell loans or other assets from time to time and those sales could be treated as prohibited transactions. We cannot make any assurance that we will not be subject to the prohibited transactions tax on some income we earn.\nThe failure of a mezzanine loan to qualify as a real estate asset could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.\nWe own certain mezzanine loans and in the future may acquire additional mezzanine loans for which the IRS has provided a safe harbor but not rules of substantive law. In Revenue Procedure 2003-65, the IRS provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan, if it meets certain requirements, will be treated by the IRS as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and interest derived from the mezzanine loan will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the REIT 75% gross income test. We own certain mezzanine loans and in the future may acquire mezzanine loans that do not meet all of the requirements of this safe harbor. The IRS could challenge such loan\u2019s treatment as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset and gross income tests and, if such a challenge were sustained, we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.\nThe REIT provisions of the Code substantially limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Under these provisions, any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets each such hedge a Borrowings Hedge, or manages the risk of certain currency fluctuations (each such hedge a Currency Hedge, and such instrument is properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute \u201cgross income\u201d for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests. This exclusion from the 95% and 75% gross income tests also applies if we previously entered into a Borrowings Hedge or a Currency Hedge, a portion of the hedged indebtedness or property is disposed of, and in connection with such extinguishment or disposition we enter into a new \u201cclearly identified\u201d hedging transaction to offset the prior hedging position. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we intend to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks\nassociated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in our TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the TRS.\nThere is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to REITs.\nThe IRS, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review U.S. federal income tax legislation, regulations and other guidance. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.\nThe ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.\nOur Charter provides that the board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if the board determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income and we generally would no longer be required to distribute any of our net taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders.\nOur TRS structure increases our overall tax liability.\nWe own interests in multiple portfolios of hotel and healthcare properties. Some of these properties are leased to our TRSs, which, in turn, engage \u201celigible independent contractors\u201d to operate such properties. Such an arrangement is referred to as a \u201cRIDEA structure.\u201d We refer to the TRS lessees in our RIDEA structures as our \u201cTRS Lessees.\u201d Our TRS Lessees are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax on their taxable income, which consists of the revenues from the hotel and healthcare properties leased by our TRS Lessees, net of the operating expenses for such properties and rent payments to us. Accordingly, although our ownership of our TRS Lessees allows us to participate in the operating income from our hotel and healthcare properties in addition to receiving rent, that operating income is fully subject to income tax. The after-tax net income of our TRS Lessees is available for distribution to us. Additionally, our entire investment management business is held through our TRSs, and therefore any income from investment advice or management is fully subject to income tax.\nOur ownership of TRSs is limited and our transactions with our TRSs may cause us to be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if those transactions are not conducted on arm\u2019s-length terms.\nA REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT, including gross operating income from hotels and healthcare properties that are operated by eligible independent contractors pursuant to management agreements. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of a REIT\u2019s gross assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. In addition, the TRS rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. The rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\nOur TRSs are subject to U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income tax on their taxable income and their after-tax net income is available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed to us. We believe that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our TRSs is and will continue to be less than 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our total gross assets (including our TRS stock and securities). Furthermore, we will monitor the value of our respective investments in our TRSs for the purpose of ensuring compliance with TRS ownership limitations. In addition, we will scrutinize all of our transactions with our TRSs to ensure that they are entered into on arm\u2019s-length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 25% or 20% limitations discussed above or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\nIf our leases with our TRS Lessees are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we are required to satisfy two gross income tests, pursuant to which specified percentages of our gross income must be passive income, such as rent. For the rent paid pursuant to the hotel and healthcare property leases with our TRS Lessees to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement. We have structured our leases, and intend to structure any future leases, so that the leases will be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with this characterization, not challenge this treatment or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the leases were not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could fail to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs and could fail to qualify for REIT status.\nIf our hotel and healthcare property managers do not qualify as \u201celigible independent contractors,\u201d we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\nRent paid by a lessee that is a \u201crelated party tenant\u201d of ours will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs. We lease all of our hotels and a substantial portion of our healthcare properties to our TRS Lessees. A TRS Lessee will not be treated as a \u201crelated party tenant\u201d and will not be treated as directly operating a hospitality facility to the extent the TRS Lessee leases properties from us that are managed by an \u201celigible independent contractor.\u201d In addition, our TRS Lessees will fail to qualify as TRSs if they lease or own a hospitality or healthcare facility that is not managed by an \u201celigible independent contractor.\u201d\nIf our hotel and healthcare property managers do not qualify as \u201celigible independent contractors,\u201d we could fail to qualify as a REIT. Each of the hotel and healthcare management companies that enters into a management contract with our TRS Lessees must qualify as an \u201celigible independent contractor\u201d under the REIT rules in order for the rent paid to us by our TRS Lessees to be qualifying income for our REIT income test requirements and for our TRS Lessees to qualify as TRSs. Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor a manager must not own more than 35% of our outstanding shares (by value) and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the manager, taking into account only owners of more than 5% of our shares and, with respect to ownership interests in such managers that are publicly traded, only holders of more than 5% of such ownership interests. Complex ownership attribution rules apply for purposes of these 35% thresholds. Although we intend to monitor ownership of our shares by our property managers and their owners, there can be no assurance that these ownership levels will not be exceeded.\nWe may lose our REIT status if the IRS successfully challenges our characterization of our income from our foreign TRSs.\nWe have elected to treat several non-U.S. companies, including issuers in CDO transactions, as TRSs. We will likely be required to include in our income, even without the receipt of actual distributions, earnings from our investment in the foreign TRSs. Income inclusions from equity investments in foreign corporations are technically neither actual dividends nor any of the other enumerated categories of qualifying income for the 95% gross income test. However, the IRS has issued private letter rulings to other REITs holding that income inclusions from equity investments in foreign corporations would be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. Private letter rulings may be relied upon only by the taxpayers to whom they are issued and the IRS may revoke a private letter ruling. Based on those private letter rulings, we intend to treat such income inclusions as qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. Nevertheless, no assurance can be provided that the IRS would not successfully challenge our treatment of such income as qualifying income. In the event that such income was determined not to qualify for the 95% gross income test, we could be subject to a penalty tax with respect to such income to the extent it exceeds 5% of our gross income or we could fail to continue to qualify as a REIT.\nIf our foreign TRSs are subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level, it would greatly reduce the amounts those entities would have available to distribute to us and that they would have available to pay their creditors.\nThere is a specific exemption from U.S. federal income tax for non-U.S. corporations that restrict their activities in the United States to trading stock and securities (or any activity closely related thereto) for their own account whether such trading (or such other activity) is conducted by the corporation or its employees through a resident broker, commission agent, custodian or other agent. We intend that our foreign TRSs will rely on that exemption or otherwise operate in a manner so that they will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their net income at the entity level. If the IRS succeeded in challenging that tax treatment, it would greatly reduce the amount that those foreign TRSs would have available to pay to their creditors and to distribute to us.\nWe could fail to continue to qualify as a REIT and/or pay additional taxes if the IRS recharacterizes certain of our international investments.\nWe have, and intend to continue make additional, property investments in international jurisdictions. Our equity in such investments is funded through the use of instruments that we believe should be treated as equity for U.S. tax purposes. If the IRS disagreed with such characterization and was successful in recharacterizing the nature of our investments in international jurisdictions, we could fail to satisfy one or more of the asset and gross income tests applicable to REITs. Additionally, if the IRS recharacterized the nature of our investments and we were to take action to prevent such REIT test failures, the actions we would take could expose us to increased taxes both internationally and in the United States.\nWe could be subject to increased taxes if the tax authorities in various international jurisdictions were to modify tax rules and regulations on which we have relied in structuring our international investments.\nWe currently receive favorable tax treatment in various international jurisdictions through tax rules, regulations, tax authority rulings, and international tax treaties. Should changes occur to these rules, regulations, rulings or treaties, we may no longer receive such benefits, and consequently, the amount of taxes we pay with respect to our international investments may increase.\nOur qualification as a REIT could be jeopardized as a result of our interest in joint ventures or funds.\nWe currently own, and intend to continue to acquire, limited partner or non-managing member interests in partnerships and limited liability companies that are joint ventures or funds. If a partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT or require us to pay tax, we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity. In addition, it is possible that a partnership or limited liability company could take an action which could cause us to fail a REIT gross income or asset test, and that we would not become aware of such action in time to dispose of our interest in the partnership or limited liability company or take other corrective action on a timely basis. In that case, we could fail to continue to qualify as a REIT unless we are able to qualify for a statutory REIT \u201csavings\u201d provision, which may require us to pay a significant penalty tax to maintain our REIT qualification.\nMajor changes in the U.S. income tax laws applicable to corporations generally could adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nThe current Congress and the Trump Administration are considering major changes to the U.S. laws governing the taxation of corporations generally. It is not possible to predict whether any such changes will be enacted, what form any such changes might take, or whether the changes would extend to the rule governing the current taxation of REITs. If the changes were to apply to REITs, there could be no assurance that they might not adversely impact our current methods for conducting business, or our ability to continue to qualify as a REIT. Even if the changes do not apply directly to REITs, they could have the effect of reducing the taxes of corporations generally, which in turn could have the effect of making the stock of those corporations more valuable relative to the value to stocks of REITs.\nWe will be subject to corporate income tax on the sale of assets acquired from or previously held by a C corporation within five years of our acquisition of those assets or our becoming a REIT.\nIf REIT previously was a C corporation, or it acquires any asset from a C corporation, or a corporation that generally is subject to full corporate-level tax, in a merger or other transaction in which it acquires a basis in the asset that is determined by reference either to the C corporation\u2019s basis in the asset or to another asset, the REIT generally will pay tax at the highest regular corporate rate applicable if it recognizes gain on the sale or disposition of the asset during the 5-year period after it becomes a REIT or it acquires the asset. Because NSAM previously was a C corporation, this tax will generally apply to gain recognized with respect to assets that were held by NSAM as of the effective date of our REIT election (January 1, 2017) if such gain is recognized during the 5-year period following such effective date or it may apply if we were to engage in an merger transaction with another C corporation in the future. The amount of gain on which we would pay tax in the foregoing circumstances is the lesser of (i) the amount of gain that we recognize at the time of the sale or disposition; and (ii) the amount of gain that we would have recognized if we had sold the asset at the time we acquired it (or in the case of NSAM assets, on January 1, 2017).\nWe are restricted in our ability to transfer cash from the Operating Partnership to the Company within two years following the Mergers without incurring adverse tax consequences.\nUnder the \u201cdisguised sale\u201d rules that apply when a partner transfers property to a partnership and the partnership transfers cash to the partner within two years of that transfer, we are restricted in our ability to transfer cash from the Operating Partnership to the Company within two years following the Mergers, unless that transfer can qualify to an exception provided for the applicable regulations or was not contemplated at the time of the Mergers, without incurring adverse tax consequences. We do not anticipate that these rules will limit our ability to pay regular dividends from the operating cash flow of the Operating Partnership, but they could restrict our ability make repurchases of our Class A common stock and/or our preferred stock pursuant to our previously announced stock repurchase program. We believe that we will have the capacity to make substantial repurchases, but we may not have the flexibility to repurchase as much stock as we would otherwise elect, depending upon future market conditions.", "PERMNO": 14686, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "CLNY"}
