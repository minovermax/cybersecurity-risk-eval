{"cik": "1326205", "company": "India Globalization Capital, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-07-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report in evaluating our company and our common stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our common stock and other securities also could be adversely affected. We make various statements in this section, which constitute \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business and Expansion Strategy\nOur strategy with two distinct lines of business makes it difficult to find accretive acquisitions and attract management.\nAttracting management that understand the US regulatory environment, public company compliance, and is comfortable in the foreign countries we operate in is difficult. Finding them in acquired companies is even more difficult. The acquisitions we make will depend on our ability to identify suitable companies to acquire, to complete those acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us and in the timeframes and within the budgets we expect, and to thereafter improve the results of operations of the acquired companies and successfully integrate their operations on an accretive basis. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in any or all of these steps.\nWe may be unable to continue to scale our operations, make acquisitions, or continue as a going concern if we do not successfully raise additional capital.\nBuilding facilities, conducting research, and creating products from our formulations either in the pharmaceutical or nutraceutical space require additional capital. If we are unable to successfully raise the capital we need we may need to reduce the scope of our businesses to fully satisfy our future short-term liquidity requirements. If we cannot raise additional capital or reduce the scope of our business, we may be otherwise unable to achieve our goals or continue our operations. We have incurred losses from operations in our prior two fiscal years and have a lack of liquidity for expansion. While we believe that we will be able to raise the capital we need to continue our operations, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts or will be able to raise enough capital for planned expansion.\nWe have a history of operating losses and there can be no assurance that we can again achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur short-term focus is to become profitable. However, there can be no guarantee that our efforts will be successful. Even if we again achieve profitability, given our dependence on foreign country GDP growth and macroeconomic factors, we may not be able to sustain profitability and our failure to do so would adversely affect our businesses, including our ability to raise additional funds.\nWe expect to acquire companies and we are subject to evolving and often expensive corporate governance regulations and requirements. Our failure to adequately adhere to these requirements, and comply with them with regard to acquired companies, some of which may be non-reporting entities, or the failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could seriously harm our business and affect our status as a reporting company listed on a national securities exchange.\nAs a public reporting company whose shares are listed for trading on the NYSE MKT, we are subject to various regulations. Compliance with these evolving regulations is costly and requires a significant diversion of management time and attention, particularly with regard to our disclosure on controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. As we have made and continue to make acquisitions in foreign countries, our internal controls and procedures may not be able to prevent errors or fraud in the future. We cannot guarantee that we can establish internal controls over financial reporting immediately on companies that we acquire. Thus, faulty judgments, simple errors or mistakes, or the failure of our personnel to enforce controls over acquired companies or to adhere to established controls and procedures, may make it difficult for us to ensure that the objectives of our control systems are met. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect other than inconsequential errors or fraud could seriously harm our ability to continue as a reporting company listed on a national securities exchange.\nWe have a limited senior management team size that may hamper our ability to effectively manage a publicly traded company and manage acquisitions and that may harm our business.\nSince we operate in several foreign countries, we use consultants, including lawyers and accountants, to help us comply with regulatory requirements and public company compliance on a timely basis. As we expand, we expect to increase the size of our senior management. However, we cannot guarantee that in the interim period our senior management can adequately manage the requirements of a public company and the integration of acquisitions, and any failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines, penalties, harm our business, status as a reporting company and our listing on the NYSE MKT.\nWe own 24.9% of Midtown Partners (MTP) and will be subject to risks associated with being a minority member of the LLC with limited control.\nWe own 24.9% of MTP and, therefore, the investment will subject us to risks associated with being a minority member of the LLC with limited control. In addition to the specific risks associated with the minority investment in Midtown Partners, we will be subject to general acquisition-related risks discussed more generally in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOur expansion is dependent on laws pertaining to the legal cannabis industry.\nWe expect to acquire companies and hire management in the areas that we have identified. These include, among others, electronics and bio-pharmaceuticals with a focus on capitalizing on specific niches within these areas such as phytocannabinoid-based therapies. Entry into any of these areas requires special knowledge of the industry and products. In the event that we are perceived to be entering the legal cannabis sector, even indirectly or remotely, we could be subject to increased scrutiny by regulators because, among other things, marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Our failure to adequately manage the risk associated with these businesses and adequately manage the requirements of the regulators can adversely affect our business, our status as a reporting company and our listing on the NYSE MKT. Further, any adverse pronouncements from regulators about businesses related to the legal cannabis sector could adversely affect our stock price if we are perceived to be in a company in the cannabis sector.\nOur company is in a very new and highly regulated industry. Significant and unforeseen changes in policy may have material impacts on our business.\nContinued development in the phytocannabinoids industry is dependent upon continued state legislative authorization of cannabis as well as legislation and regulatory policy at the federal level. The federal Controlled Substances Act currently makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. While there may be ample public support for legislative authorization, numerous factors impact the legislative process. Any one of these factors could slow or halt use and handling of cannabis in the United States or in other jurisdictions, which would negatively impact our development of phytocannabinoid-based therapies and our ability to test and productize these therapies.\nMany U.S. state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act. While we do not intend to distribute or sell cannabis in the United States, it is unclear whether regulatory authorities in the United States would object to the registration or public offering of securities in the United States by our company, to the status of our company as a reporting company, or even to investors investing in our company if we engage in legal cannabis production and supply pursuant to the laws and authorization of the jurisdiction where the activity takes place. In addition, the status of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act may have an adverse effect on federal agency approval of pharmaceutical use of phytocannabinoid products. Any such objection or interference could delay indefinitely or increase substantially the costs to access the equity capital markets, test our therapies, or create products from these phytocannabinoid based therapies.\nBanks and clearing houses may make it difficult for us to trade and clear our stock because they believe we are in the cannabis industry.\nContinued development of the cannabis industry is dependent upon continued legislative authorization of cannabis. While there may be ample public support for legislative authorization, numerous factors impact the legislative process. Additionally, many U.S. state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis in the United States, our presence in the pharmaceutical space can be misunderstood as being in the sale and distribution part of the cannabis industry. This could lead banks, regulators and others to mislabel our company. As such our stock could suffer if investors are unable to deposit their shares with a broker dealer and have those share clear.\nOur business is dependent on continuing relationships with clients and strategic partners.\nOur business requires developing and maintaining strategic alliances with contractors that undertake turnkey contracts for infrastructure development projects and with government organizations. The business and our results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain continuing relationships and pre-qualified status with key clients and strategic partners.\nCurrency fluctuations may reduce our profitability.\nElectronics are mostly traded in U.S. dollars. However, the supply side, including logistics in China is settled in RMB. Therefore, two and sometimes three currencies are involved in a typical trade. Fluctuations of one currency relative to the others may adversely affect our profit margins.\nOur business relies heavily on our management team and any unexpected loss of key officers may adversely affect our operations.\nThe continued success of our business is largely dependent on the continued services of our key employees. The loss of the services of certain key personnel, without adequate replacement, could have an adverse effect on our performance. Our senior management, as well as the senior management of our subsidiaries, plays a significant role in developing and executing the overall business plan, maintaining client relationships, proprietary processes and technology. While no one is irreplaceable, the loss of the services of any would be disruptive to our business.\nOur quarterly revenue, operating results and profitability will vary.\nFactors that may contribute to the variability of quarterly revenue, operating results or profitability include:\n\u00b7 Fluctuations in revenue due to seasonality of the electronics market place, which results in uneven revenue and operating results over the year;\n\u00b7 Additions and departures of key personnel; and\n\u00b7 Strategic decisions made by us and our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments and changes in business strategy.\nWe have filed a lawsuit against Ironman that could result in a write down of our holdings in China\nWe have filed a lawsuit in the circuit court of Maryland, against 24 defendants related to the acquisition of Ironman, seeking to have the court order rescission of the underlying Acquisition Agreement and to void any past or future transfer of IGC shares to the defendants. It is anticipated that the lawsuit will go to trial in mid-2017. Adjudication of the court case in favor of IGC would mean that the Ironman assets would be removed from the balance sheet of IGC reducing IGC\u2019s total assets and a reduction in the corresponding additional paid in capital. An adverse ruling by the court would result in a potential reevaluation or sale of Ironman assets and a possible write down of the assets.\nWe may not successfully register the provisional patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office\nWe have filed five provisional patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), in the combination therapy space, for the indications of pain, medical refractory epilepsy and cachexia as part of our intellectual property strategy focused on the phytocannabinoid-based health care industry. There is no guarantee that our applications will result in a successful registration with the USPTO. If we are unsuccessful in registering patents, our ability to create a valuable line of products can be adversely affected. This in turn may have a material and adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nFuture sales of common stock by us could cause our stock price to decline and dilute your ownership in our company.\nThere are currently 11,656,668 outstanding public warrants to purchase 1,165,265 shares of our common stock and stock options to purchase 130,045 shares of our common stock. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock by us in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. If we raise funds by issuing additional securities in the future or the outstanding warrants or stock options to purchase our common stock are exercised, the newly-issued shares will also dilute your percentage ownership in our company.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Fluctuations in our stock price may not be correlated in a predictable way to our performance or operating results. Our stock price may fluctuate as a result of a number of events and factors such as those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, events described in this report, and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market, in general, has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. Our common stock has also been volatile, with our 52-week price range being at a low of $0.14 and a high of $0.83 per share. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. In addition, it is possible, given our current trading price, that we may fail to comply with the minimum trading price required to trade our shares on the NYSE Market.\nOur publicly-filed reports are subject to review by the SEC, and any significant changes or amendments required as a result of any such review may result in material liability to us and may have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe reports of publicly-traded companies are subject to review by the SEC from time to time for the purpose of assisting companies in complying with applicable disclosure requirements, and the SEC is required to undertake a comprehensive review of a company\u2019s reports at least once every three years under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. SEC reviews may be initiated at any time. We could be required to modify, amend or reformulate information contained in prior filings as a result of an SEC review, as well as state in filings that we have inadequate control or expertise over financial reporting. Any modification, amendment or reformulation of information contained in such reports could be significant and result in material liability to us and have a material and adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. In addition, the terms of our debt agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on any of our capital stock except dividends payable in additional shares of capital stock.\nMaryland anti-takeover provisions and certain anti-takeover effects of our Charter and Bylaws may inhibit a takeover at a premium price that may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nMaryland anti-takeover provisions and certain anti-takeover effects of our charter and bylaws may be utilized, under some circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company at a premium price that would be beneficial to our stockholders. For more detailed information about these provisions, please see \u201cAnti-takeover Law, Limitations of Liability and Indemnification\u201d as following.\nBusiness Combinations. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, some business combinations, including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in some circumstances, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities, are prohibited for a period of time and require an extraordinary vote. These transactions include those between a Maryland corporation and the following persons (a \u201cSpecified Person\u201d):\n\u00b7 an interested stockholder, which is defined as any person (other than a subsidiary) who beneficially owns 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock, or who is an affiliate or an associate of the corporation who, at any time within a two-year period prior to the transaction, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation\u2019s voting stock; or\n\u00b7 an affiliate of an interested stockholder.\nA person is not an interested stockholder if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. The board of directors of a Maryland corporation also may exempt a person from these business combination restrictions prior to the time the person becomes a Specified Person and may provide that its exemption be subject to compliance with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors. Transactions between a corporation and a Specified Person are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which such stockholder becomes a Specified Person. After five years, any business combination must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation and two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of shares other than voting stock held by the Specified Person with whom the business combination is to be effected, unless the corporation\u2019s stockholders receive a minimum price as defined by Maryland law and other conditions under Maryland law are satisfied.\nA Maryland corporation may elect not to be governed by these provisions by having its board of directors exempt various Specified Persons, by including a provision in its charter expressly electing not to be governed by the applicable provision of Maryland law or by amending its existing charter with the approval of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation and two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of shares other than those held by any Specified Person. Our Charter does not include any provision opting out of these business combination provisions.\nControl Share Acquisitions. The Maryland General Corporation Law also prevents, subject to exceptions, an acquirer who acquires sufficient shares to exercise specified percentages of voting power of a corporation from having any voting rights except to the extent approved by two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter not including shares of stock owned by the acquiring person, any directors who are employees of the corporation and any officers of the corporation. These provisions are referred to as the control share acquisition statute.\nThe control share acquisition statute does not apply to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction, or to acquisitions approved or exempted prior to the acquisition by a provision contained in the corporation\u2019s charter or bylaws. Our Bylaws include a provision exempting us from the restrictions of the control share acquisition statute, but this provision could be amended or rescinded either before or after a person acquired control shares. As a result, the control share acquisition statute could discourage offers to acquire our common stock and could increase the difficulty of completing an offer.\nBoard of Directors. The Maryland General Corporation Law provides that a Maryland corporation which is subject to the Exchange Act and has at least three outside directors (who are not affiliated with an acquirer of the company) under certain circumstances may elect by resolution of the board of directors or by amendment of its charter or bylaws to be subject to statutory corporate governance provisions that may be inconsistent with the corporation\u2019s charter and bylaws. Under these provisions, a board of directors may divide itself into three separate classes without the vote of stockholders such that only one-third of the directors are elected each year. A board of directors classified in this manner cannot be altered by amendment to the charter of the corporation. Further, the board of directors may, by electing to be covered by the applicable statutory provisions and notwithstanding the corporation\u2019s charter or bylaws:\n\u00b7 provide that a special meeting of stockholders will be called only at the request of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting,\n\u00b7 reserve for itself the right to fix the number of directors,\n\u00b7 provide that a director may be removed only by the vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors, and\n\u00b7 retain for itself sole authority to fill vacancies created by an increase in the size of the board or the death, removal or resignation of a director.\nIn addition, a director elected to fill a vacancy under these provisions serves for the balance of the unexpired term instead of until the next annual meeting of stockholders. A board of directors may implement all or any of these provisions without amending the charter or bylaws and without stockholder approval. Although a corporation may be prohibited by its charter or by resolution of its board of directors from electing any of the provisions of the statute, we have not adopted such a prohibition. We have adopted a staggered board of directors with three separate classes in our charter and given the board the right to fix the number of directors, but we have not prohibited the amendment of these provisions. The adoption of the staggered board may discourage offers to acquire our common stock and may increase the difficulty of completing an offer to acquire our stock. If our Board chose to implement the statutory provisions, it could further discourage offers to acquire our common stock and could further increase the difficulty of completing an offer to acquire our common stock.\nEffect of Certain Provisions of our Charter and Bylaws. In addition to the Charter and Bylaws provisions discussed above, certain other provisions of our Bylaws may have the effect of impeding the acquisition of control of our company by means of a tender offer, proxy fight, open market purchases or otherwise in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. These provisions of Bylaws are intended to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited proposal for the restructuring or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an unsolicited takeover attempt, which our Board believes is otherwise unfair to our stockholders. These provisions, however, also could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company.\nOur Bylaws provide that with respect to annual meetings of stockholders, (i) nominations of individuals for election to our Board of Directors and (ii) the proposal of business to be considered by stockholders may be made only pursuant to our notice of the meeting, by or at the direction of our Board of Directors, or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in our Bylaws.\nSpecial meetings of stockholders may be called only by the chief executive officer, the board of directors or the secretary of our company (upon the written request of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote). At a special meeting of stockholders, the only business that may be conducted is the business specified in our notice of meeting. With respect to nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors, nominations may be made at a special meeting of stockholders only pursuant to our notice of meeting, by or at the direction of our Board of Directors, or if our Board of Directors has determined that directors will be elected at the special meeting, by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in our Bylaws.\nThese procedures may limit the ability of stockholders to bring business before a stockholders meeting, including the nomination of directors and the consideration of any transaction that could result in a change in control and that may result in a premium to our stockholders.\nRisk Related to Our Securities\nOur accounting personnel is inexperienced in maintaining books and records and preparing financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and regulations and may make unintentional errors.\nOur accounting personnel are located in India, Hong Kong, Malaysia, China and the United States, primarily near our businesses. The staff in Malaysia is new, as they were part of an acquisition made in 2016. While training is ongoing, we cannot guarantee that they will not make a mistake. We have addressed this by hiring consultants with sufficient background in SEC reporting and filing requirements and training staff on accounting and reporting controls and procedures. In addition, we have engaged a legal firm with extensive SEC reporting expertise and an individual with extensive SEC and GAAP reporting experience to help us with our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. However, despite these efforts, a mistake in our ability to prepare financial statements and maintain our books and records in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and SEC rules and regulations, could constitute a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting unless rectified. For more information, please see Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d\nWe incur costs as a result of operating as a public company. Our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. Because we report in U.S. GAAP, we may experience delays in closing our books and records, and delays in the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures.\nAs part of a public company with operations substantially in foreign countries, we experience increased legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the new rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE MKT have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. We expect to take actions that include the curtailment of activity whose reporting and compliance costs exceed any present or future shareholder benefit. We also anticipate installing improved systems and processes. However, we cannot be certain as to the timing or completion of the remediation actions, or their full impact on our operations. Furthermore, it is difficult to hire personnel in India, Malaysia and China who have sufficient experience with U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and regulations. We do not foresee a problem other than the time and increased cost required to hire qualified individuals, complete the training and to implement the improved processes. However, until then we may experience delays in the preparations of financial statements and related disclosures.\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal controls and financial reporting, and our lack of accounting personnel with sufficient U.S. GAAP experience may limit our ability to prevent or detect financial misstatements or omissions. As a result, our financial reports may not always comply with U.S. GAAP and the Accounting Standards Codification. Any material weakness, misstatement or omission in our financial statements will negatively affect the market, and price of our stock which could result in significant loss to our investors.\nWe have not had a chief financial officer with significant U.S. GAAP or SEC reporting experience. Our strategy to supplement the gap in reporting knowledge or experience is to use the advisory services of experts. Although we are actively seeking individuals with sufficient knowledge of U.S. GAAP and Accounting Standards Codification and SEC rules and regulations, qualified individuals with necessary language and geographic experience are proving to be difficult to find. Therefore, we may experience \u201cweakness\u201d and potential issues in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This \u201cweakness\u201d also includes a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified a weakness relating to our company not having sufficient experienced personnel with the requisite technical skills and working knowledge of the application of U.S. GAAP, and internal controls over financial reporting, particularly with our reporting in China. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are also subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of new acquisitions, changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. This may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls, which could affect the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations. Failure to comply or adequately comply with any laws, rules, or regulations applicable to our business may result in fines or regulatory actions, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operation, or financial condition and could result in delays in achieving either the effectiveness of a registration statement or the development of an active and liquid trading market for our common stock. To the extent that the market place perceives that we do not have a strong financial staff and internal controls over financial reporting, the market for and price of our stock may be impaired.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements.
