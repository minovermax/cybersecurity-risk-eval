{"cik": "1610092", "company": "Diplomat Pharmacy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, prospects, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as in any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes or trends within the specialty pharmacy industry could have a significant negative impact on our ability to compete successfully.\nThe specialty pharmacy industry is growing and evolving rapidly. Any significant shifts in the structure of the specialty pharmacy industry or the healthcare products and services industry in general could alter the industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers. These changes or trends could result from, among other things, a large intra- or inter-industry merger, a new entrant in the specialty pharmacy business, changes in the distribution model for specialty drugs, a slowdown in the biotechnology pharmaceutical pipeline in our areas of expertise, consolidation of shipping carriers or the necessary changes or unintended consequences of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the \"Health Reform Laws\") or future regulatory changes. Our failure to anticipate or appropriately\nadapt to any of these changes or trends, none of which are within our control, could have a significant negative impact our competitive position and materially adversely affect our business.\nSignificant and increasing pressure from third-party payors to limit reimbursements and the impact of high cost specialty drugs could materially adversely impact our profitability, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, government programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state funded programs) and other third-party payors to limit pharmacy reimbursements may adversely impact our profitability. While manufacturers have increased the price of drugs, payors have generally decreased reimbursement rates as a percentage of drug cost. We expect pricing pressures from third-party payors to continue given the high and increasing costs of specialty drugs. Given the significant competition in the industry, we have limited bargaining power to counter payor demands for reduced reimbursement rates. If a significant number of patients cannot afford to cover the portions of specialty drug costs not covered by payors as a result of limited reimbursements, and we are unable to find other sources of funding for such patients, those patients may not fill their prescriptions and our revenues and business could be adversely affected.\nIn response to rising specialty drug prices, payors may also demand that we provide additional services, enhanced service levels and other cost savings to help mitigate the increase in drug costs. Additional services with minimal or no service fees would adversely impact our profitability and data-management technology and software make it challenging for us to prove specific cost savings to payors. Our inability or failure to demonstrate cost efficiencies could adversely impact a payor's willingness to engage us, exclusively or at all, as a specialty pharmacy in the face of rising drug costs.\nChanges in reimbursement rates from Medicare and Medicaid for the services we provide may cause our revenue and profitability to decline.\nReimbursement from government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, implementation of reimbursement procedures, retroactive payment adjustments, governmental funding restrictions, changes to existing legislation, and the enactment of new legislation, all of which may materially affect the amount and timing of reimbursement payments to us. Changes to the way Medicare and Medicaid pay for our services may reduce our revenue and profitability on services provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients and increase our working capital requirements.\nSince its inception in 2006, Medicare Part D has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates as higher margin business, such as cash and state Medicaid customers, migrated to Medicare Part D coverage. Further, as a result of the Affordable Care Act and changes to Medicare Part D, such as the elimination in 2013 of the tax deductibility of the retiree drug subsidy payment received by sponsors of retiree drug plans, our pharmacy benefit manager clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their Medicare-eligible members. To the extent this occurs, the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into Medicare Part D may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our Medicare Part D business.\nIf our relationship with any of our key pharmaceutical manufacturers deteriorates, or if we are unable to create new significant relationships with other pharmaceutical manufacturers, we could lose all or a significant portion of our access to existing and future specialty drugs.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of pharmaceutical manufacturers have attempted to significantly limit the number of pharmacies that may dispense their drugs. Out of a total of approximately 60,000 traditional and specialty pharmacies, these manufacturers increasingly limit access\nto their drugs to anywhere from one to 20 specialty pharmacies, to ensure they can manage a drug's rollout, obtain real time data and confirm the unique patient population's receipt of the necessary services and support to remain adherent. There are a number of limited distribution drugs to which we do not have access. In addition to directly providing significant revenues, access to limited distribution drugs provides us with significant competitive advantages in developing relationships with payors and physicians, and our failure to continue obtaining access to new limited distribution pharmaceuticals or losing our current access could have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nWe obtain access to limited distribution drugs primarily from small to mid-size biotechnology companies, many of whom are bringing their first or second drug to market. We incur significant expense and time, and opportunity cost, to educate and assist emerging small and mid-size biotechnology manufacturers in bringing these products to the marketplace without any guarantee of a successful drug launch or future sales. The failure to monetize these relationships could adversely impact our profitability and our prospects.\nWe also provide a significant amount of direct and indirect services for the benefit of our pharmaceutical manufacturer customers and our patients in order to get access to specialty drugs, and our failure to provide services at optimal quality could result in losing access to existing and future drugs. In addition, we incur significant costs in providing these services and receive minimal service fees in return. If pharmaceutical manufacturers require significant additional services and products to obtain access to their drugs without a corresponding increase in service fees paid to us, our profitability could be adversely impacted.\nWe have limited contractual protections with pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers that supply us with most of the pharmaceuticals that we distribute.\nWe dispense specialty pharmaceuticals that are supplied to us by a variety of manufacturers and wholesalers, many of which are our only source of that specific pharmaceutical. Our contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers often provide us with, among other things:\n\u2022 discounts on drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our specialty pharmacies;\n\u2022 rebates and service fees; and\n\u2022 access to limited distribution specialty pharmaceuticals.\nOur contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers are generally for three years and are terminable on reasonably short notice by either party before or after the contract term. In addition, our contracts with wholesalers provide for purchase money security interests in products sold. If several of these contractual relationships are terminated or materially altered by the pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers or we are otherwise unable to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts on favorable terms we could lose a major source of the pharmaceuticals we dispense.\nOur revenues, profitability and cash flows may be negatively impacted if safety risks of a specialty drug are publicized or if a specialty drug is withdrawn from the market due to manufacturing or other issues.\nPhysicians may significantly reduce the numbers of prescriptions for a specialty drug with safety concerns or manufacturing issues. Additionally, negative press regarding a drug with a higher safety risk profile may result in reduced global consumer demand for such drug. Decreased utilization and demand of a specialty drug we distribute could materially and adversely impact our volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows.\nMany healthcare companies have a presence in the specialty pharmacy market, and we expect a significant increase in competition due to high growth anticipated in specialty drug spending, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nThere are a significant number of competitors that provide one or more comprehensive services, including distribution, with respect to specialty pharmacy drugs, some of whom have greater resources than we do, including: pharmacy benefit managers; retail pharmacy chains and independent retail pharmacies; health plans; national, regional and niche specialty pharmacies; home and specialty infusion therapy companies; physician practices and hospital systems and group purchasing organizations.\nWe are currently the largest independent specialty pharmacy in the U.S., with a 3% overall market share (based on 2014 revenues from pharmacy-dispensed specialty drugs). The three leading specialty pharmacies, which operate as divisions within each of Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and Walgreens, have significantly greater market share, resources and purchasing power than we do, and Express Scripts and CVS Caremark also benefit from their services as pharmacy benefit managers to a number of healthcare organizations. As we increase in scale and market share, we expect more direct competition for certain drugs, payor and patient access, and services from these three companies.\nFurther, a number of other traditional pharmacies with significant resources are attempting to build, acquire or partner with specialty pharmacies due to the double-digit growth anticipated in spending on specialty prescription drugs compared to low to negative growth in spending on traditional prescription drugs. There are also many smaller specialty pharmacies and other entities in the healthcare industry that provide limited specialty pharmacy services; while such entities presently compete with us to a lesser extent, they may be able to invest significant resources, through acquisition or otherwise, to compete with us on a larger scale.\nMoreover, many of the retail pharmacies to which we provide patient management services may in the future acquire a competing specialty pharmacy business or start their own specialty pharmacy business and thereby become our competitors. In addition, many of our pharmacy benefit management customers have their own specialty pharmacy businesses, and to the extent certain of our products can be obtained internally, these customers could cease to do business with us. Our failure to maintain and expand relationships with payors and pharmacy benefit management companies, who can effectively determine the pharmacy source for their members, could materially and adversely affect our competitive position and prospects.\nAny increase in competition noted above could significantly increase the competition for limited distribution drugs, reduce gross profit, and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur ability to grow our specialty pharmacy business could be limited if we do not expand the number of drugs and treatments we offer or if we lose even a small percentage of our existing patients.\nOur specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high cost medications that serve a relatively small patient population. Due to the limited patient populations utilizing the medications that our specialty pharmacy business handles, our future growth relies, in part, on expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories. Further, given our relatively high net sales and gross profit per prescription dispensed, a small percentage decrease in our patient base or reduction in demand for any reason for the medications we currently dispense could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe generate a significant amount of revenue from certain specialty drugs we dispense.\nOur three largest revenue producing specialty drugs we dispense represented 28%, 35% and 40% of our revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and our ten largest revenue producing specialty drugs we dispense represented 54%, 57% and 63% of our revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, although the mix of our highest volume specialty drugs fluctuates historically, our two largest revenue producing specialty drugs have not changed in the past three years. In the event that the use of these specialty drugs were to decline due to clinical ineffectiveness or as a result of the introduction of more effective alternatives, and we are unable to obtain access to high growth alternative specialty drugs, our revenues would be adversely affected. Loss of revenues from our three largest revenue producing specialty drugs without access to alternative high growth specialty drugs could have a material adverse effect on our revenues in the short term.\nWe receive a significant amount of prescription drugs from one wholesaler and one manufacturer. The loss of either of these relationships could disrupt our business and adversely impact our revenues for one or more fiscal quarters.\nSpecialty drug purchases from AmerisourceBergen, a drug wholesaler, and Celgene, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, represented 57% and 15%, respectively, of cost of goods sold in 2014, and 58% and 19%, respectively, of cost of goods sold in 2013. Our contract with AmerisourceBergen has an initial term of five years expiring December 31, 2016, and can be terminated by, among other things, either party's material breach that continues for 30 days. The contract also commits us to a minimum of approximately $3.5 billion in purchase obligations over a five year period. Failure to meet this minimum would result in significant additional expense without corresponding revenues. The agreement also provides for negotiated discounts that differ by drug classification, and any permitted reclassification of products by AmerisourceBergen to a lower discount category could have an adverse impact on our gross profit. In addition, AmerisourceBergen recently entered into a long term relationship with one of the largest specialty pharmacy companies in the country, which could adversely impact our relationship with AmerisourceBergen. Our significant competitors may obtain better discounts from AmerisourceBergen or other wholesalers, which could impair our competitiveness.\nOur agreement with Celgene began July 1, 2011 and was renewed on July 21, 2013 and continues until June 30, 2016, and can be terminated by either party without cause upon 90 days' prior written notice, or earlier in the event of a material breach. Unlike the specialty drugs we purchase from AmerisourceBergen, the specialty drugs we purchase from Celgene are not available from any other source.\nThe loss of either of these relationships, the failure by the suppliers to fulfill our purchase orders on a timely basis or at all, or a contractual dispute could significantly disrupt our business and adversely impact our revenues for one or more fiscal quarters. These agreements also limit our ability to distribute competing drugs, while allowing the supplier to distribute through other channels.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with significant market power and we expect such trend to continue. As provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate, thereby decreasing the number of market participants, competition to provide products and services like ours will become more intense, and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants will become greater. In addition, industry participants may try to use their increased market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services. If we are forced to reduce prices as a result of either an imbalance of market power or decreased demand for our products, revenue would be reduced and we could become significantly less profitable.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to maintain and manage our rapid growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet the demands of our customers and other constituents.\nOver the past several years our business has grown significantly, and we aim to continue to expand the scope of our operations, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. Growth in our operations will place significant demands on our management, financial and other resources. We cannot be certain that our current systems, procedures, controls, and space will adequately support expansion of our operations, and we may be unable to expand or upgrade our systems or infrastructure to accommodate future growth. Our future operating results will depend on the ability of our management and key employees to successfully maintain our independence and corporate culture, preserve the effectiveness of our high-touch patient care model, manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical, administrative, financial control and reporting systems. Our inability to finance future growth, manage future expansion or hire and retain the personnel needed to manage our business successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe have limited experience acquiring companies and may not be able to effectively execute our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nWe have grown organically since we were founded, but we recently completed two important acquisitions. In December 2013, we acquired AHF, which provides specialty drugs and infusion services for bleeding disorders, principally hemophilia. In June 2014, we acquired MedPro, a specialty pharmacy focused on specialty infusion including hemophilia and immune globulin.\nAny of the following risks associated with our recent acquisitions or future acquisitions, individually or in aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our business:\n\u2022 difficulties in realizing anticipated financial or strategic benefits of such acquisition;\n\u2022 diversion of capital from other uses;\n\u2022 potential dilution of shareholder ownership if stock is used as consideration for the acquisition or if an equity offering is completed in connection with the financing of the acquisition;\n\u2022 the risks related to increased indebtedness;\n\u2022 significant capital expenditures may be required to integrate acquisition into our operations;\n\u2022 disruption of our ongoing business or the ongoing acquired business, including impairment of existing relationships with our employees, distributors, suppliers, customers or other constituents or those of the acquired companies;\n\u2022 diversion of management's attention and other resources from current operations, including potential strain on financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022 difficulty in integrating acquired operations, including restructuring and realigning activities, personnel, technologies and products, including the loss of key employees, distributors, suppliers, customers or other constituents of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022 inability to realize cost savings, sales increases or other benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions, either as to amount or in the expected time frame;\n\u2022 assumption of known and unknown liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to quantify; and\n\u2022 non-cash impairment charges or other accounting charges relating to the acquired assets.\nOur lack of historical experience with acquisitions make the foregoing risks especially applicable to us.\nWe will continue to review strategic acquisition opportunities that will enhance our market position, expand our expertise and drug access, add value to our constituents and provide sufficient synergies. Strategic transactions, including the pursuit of such transactions, often require significant up-front costs and require significant resources and management attention. These significant up-front costs related to the assessment, due diligence, negotiation and execution of the transaction. We may also incur additional costs to retain key employees as well as transaction fees and costs related to executing our integration plans.\nFor additional information regarding risks relating to our pending acquisition of BioRx, see \"-Risks Related to Our Pending Acquisition of BioRx.\"\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results, and in particular our revenues, have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations make it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and are difficult to predict, including the following:\n\u2022 the launch timing for specialty drugs;\n\u2022 the effect of the expiration of drug patents and the introduction of generic drugs;\n\u2022 the demand for the specialty drugs to which we have access;\n\u2022 whether our expected distribution share of drugs that come to market is properly estimated;\n\u2022 whether revenues and margins on sales of drugs that come to market are properly estimated;\n\u2022 expenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional capabilities;\n\u2022 the timing of increases in drug costs by the manufacturers; and\n\u2022 changes in the reimbursement policies of payors.\nThese factors, individually or in the aggregate, could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period.\nThe failure or disruption of our information technology systems, our information security systems and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information could materially adversely affect our business.\nMany aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected, processed, stored, and handled by these systems. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain highly confidential information, including personal health information and other data that our customers and other constituents provide to purchase products or services, enroll in programs or services, register on our websites, interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with us. In addition, for these operations, we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Although we have not historically experienced a major systems failure or security breach, our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card information breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error.\nA compromise of our information security controls or those of the businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from patients, physicians and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations. Moreover, a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure, and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. If our information systems are damaged, fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and we may experience a loss of critical information, customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services. In addition, compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. See also \"-Risks Related to Federal and State Laws and Regulations-Our business operations involve the substantial receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals. A failure to adequately protect such information may harm our reputation and subject us to significant liabilities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\"\nOur failure to maintain significant relationships or build new relationships with clinical experts and key thought leaders at U.S. physician groups and universities could result in a loss of existing patients, future referrals on existing and future drugs and pharmaceutical industry data and could materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nWe have developed significant relationships with clinical experts and key opinion leaders at physician groups and universities throughout the U.S. who are focused on oncology and immunology, involved in significant research projects related to specialty drugs, and who are high-volume prescribers of specialty drugs. Our failure to provide quality and timely services to such persons and their patients could impair our relationship, which could result in a loss of existing patients, future referrals on existing and future drugs and pharmaceutical industry data (including the anticipated drug pipeline) and therefore materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nWe rely heavily on a single shipping provider, and our business could be harmed if our shipping rates increase, our provider is unavailable or our provider performs poorly and we are unable to successfully replace our shipping provider.\nA substantial majority of the specialty drugs we dispense are shipped through UPS. We depend heavily on these shipping services for efficient and cost effective delivery of our products.\nThe risks associated with our dependence on UPS include:\n\u2022 any significant increase in shipping rates, including rate increases resulting from higher fuel prices;\n\u2022 strikes or other service interruptions by UPS or by another carrier that could affect UPS;\n\u2022 spoilage of high cost drugs during shipment, since our drugs often require special handling, such as refrigeration; and\n\u2022 increased delivery errors by UPS, resulting in lost or stolen product.\nIn the event any of the foregoing occurs and we are unable to transition efficiently and effectively to a new provider, we could incur increased costs or experience a material disruption in our operations.\nA disruption in our operations could hurt our relations with our constituents and significantly impact our results of operations.\nWe depend upon our contractors and vendors and on our specialty pharmacies and other facilities for the continued operation of our business. In addition, our success depends, in part, upon our telephone sales and direct marketing efforts and our ability to provide prompt, accurate and complete services to all of our constituents. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, including hurricanes and other severe weather, terrorist attacks, power interruptions and fires could disrupt our operations and our ability to deliver our products, as well as the operations of our contractors and vendors. In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to deliver our services or products, including at our corporate headquarters building, which is our primary distribution and service facility, our revenues could be reduced and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any continuing disruption in either our computer system or our telephone system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customer orders and ship products on a timely basis, and could adversely affect our relations with our customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders or loss of customers.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management and key employees. Competition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees that we need to support our business and our anticipated future growth.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience, and continued efforts of our management. In particular, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Philip Hagerman, has led our company throughout its 39-year history. Further, we intend to grow the business significantly, which will depend on our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified individuals in key management, pharmacist, nursing and similar roles. Competition for senior management and other key personnel is intense, and the pool of suitable candidates is limited. If we lose the services of one or more of our key employees, we may not be able to find a suitable replacement and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIf a customized drug provided through our compounding services leads to significant patient injury or death, we may be exposed to significant liabilities and reputational harm.\nWe provide limited compounding services. Our compounding services include the preparation of personalized medications for patients. Our compounding pharmacists work with prescribers to customize a medication to meet a patient's specific health needs. While our compounding services accounted for less than 0.5% of our revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the risks associated with compounding could affect our overall operations. Because compounding involves the preparation of a patient-customized drug, cream, or injectable, including with respect to specific ingredients designed to increase or decrease dosage, we are exposed to a potentially large liability claim in the event that a compounded medication we prepared leads to significant patient harm or death. Such instances may also generate significant negative publicity that could harm our reputation and thereby materially affect our results of operations.\nOur industry is highly litigious and future litigation or other proceedings could subject us to significant monetary damages or penalties or require us to change our business practices, which could impair our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to risks relating to litigation, enforcement action, regulatory proceedings, government inquiries and investigations and other similar actions in connection with our business operations, including the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by our specialty and home delivery pharmacies, claims and complaints related to the various regulations to which we are subject and services rendered in connection with our disease management activity. While we are currently not\nsubject to any material litigation, such litigation is not unusual in our industry. Further, while certain costs are covered by insurance, we may incur uninsured costs related to the defense of such proceedings that could be material to our financial performance.\nFurthermore, unexpected volatility in insurance premiums or retention requirements or claims in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect investor views of us and the value of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, regarding internal control over financial reporting. Prior to becoming a public company, we were not required to comply with the requirements of Section 404 and previously we had identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for certain financial statement periods included in this report. A \"material weakness\" is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The identified material weakness related to our accounting for mandatorily redeemable common stock for public reporting companies. Specifically, upon becoming subject to the applicable accounting standards of public reporting companies as of the initial filing of the Registration Statement for our initial public offering, we erroneously did not re-characterize our shares of mandatorily redeemable common stock from equity to a liability in our consolidated balance sheets, and we did not mark-to-market this liability and record additional non-operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, in an amendment to the Registration Statement for our initial public offering, we restated our consolidated financial statements to appropriately account for such common stock for all periods presented. Although we have remediated the material weakness, we will not be required to make our first annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the year following this annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Further, our independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, LLP, will not be required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the year following this annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.\nThe process of becoming compliant with Section 404 may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time and effort to complete, and may result in additional significant deficiencies and material weaknesses being identified by us or our independent registered public accounting firm. We may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses, as well as increased independent registered public accounting firm fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter. Completing documentation of our internal control system and financial processes, remediation of control deficiencies and management testing of internal controls will require substantial effort by us.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting or our related disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price. In addition, our failure to timely file our periodic reports eventually could result in the delisting of our common stock from the New York Stock Exchange, regulatory sanctions from the SEC and the breach of covenants in our credit facilities or of any preferred equity or debt securities we may issue in the future, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our operations and your investment in our common stock.\nAny debt service obligations will reduce the funds available for other business purposes, and the terms and covenants relating to our current and future indebtedness could adversely impact our financial performance and liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had no debt outstanding under our revolving line of credit. As of such date, we could incur up to an additional $108.3 million in indebtedness under our revolving line of credit. To the extent we incur significant debt in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital or otherwise, we will be subject to risks typically associated with debt financing, such as insufficient cash flow to meet required debt service payment obligations and the inability to refinance existing indebtedness.\nIn addition, our line of credit contains covenants requiring us to, among other things, provide financial and other information reporting, provide notice upon certain events and maintain cash management arrangements. These covenants also place restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions, redeem or repurchase capital stock, make investments and loans and enter into certain transactions, including selling assets, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, or engaging in transactions with affiliates. The covenants under our line of credit also include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 to 1.00, as measured on a trailing 12-month basis, if the amount available to be drawn under our revolving line of credit is less than $20.0 million. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the covenants under our line of credit, we would be in default under the credit agreement, and may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources or otherwise not be able to draw down against our line of credit. Under such circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all.\nFor additional information regarding financing risks relating to our pending acquisition of BioRx, see \"-Risks Related to Our Pending Acquisition of BioRx.\"\nOur business could be harmed if the supply of any of the specialty drugs we distribute becomes scarce or is disrupted.\nMany specialty drugs are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages. In particular, specialty drugs used to treat disease states such as hemophilia and autoimmune conditions can depend on supplies of donated blood, which may fluctuate. A supply shortage, or in rare cases, a complete cessation of manufacturing, of a specialty drug we distribute could materially and adversely impact our volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows.\nIf some of the drugs that we provide lose their orphan drug status, we could face increased competition.\nIn order to encourage the development of drugs that might not otherwise be profitable for pharmaceutical companies, the FDA will occasionally grant certain drugs orphan status. When the FDA grants orphan status to a drug, it will not approve a second drug for the same treatment for a period of seven years unless the new drug is chemically different or clinically superior. Additionally, it is easier to gain marketing approval for an orphan drug, and there may be other financial incentives associated with the manufacturing and distribution of orphan drugs, such as extended exclusivity periods. Our business could be adversely affected by any challenges to or the expiration of a drug's orphan status. The loss of such status, the approval of new drugs notwithstanding a drug's orphan status or the development of drugs that are superior to the orphan drugs we sell could result in additional competition and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur business would be harmed if the pharmaceutical industry reduces research, development and marketing of specialty drugs that are compatible with the services we provide.\nOur business is highly dependent on continued research, development and marketing expenditures of pharmaceutical companies, and the ability of those companies to develop, supply and generate demand for specialty drugs that are compatible with the services we provide. Our business could be materially adversely affected if manufacturers fail to market and support existing drugs, research potential new treatments or to develop new drugs. Our business could also be harmed by any governmental or private initiative that would alter how drug manufacturers promote or sell products and services.\nWe support hospitals that participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program (\"340B Program\"). Recently, the 340B Program has faced increased scrutiny from Congress, federal agencies and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In the event of future changes to the 340B Program, the revenues we derive from hospital services could be adversely impacted.\nOur hospital program supports hospitals that are 340B covered entities pursuant to which such hospitals are able to purchase certain specialty drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers at a discount for dispensing to eligible patients. In cases where the covered entity treats an insured patient with a discounted specialty drug, the federal government or the patient's private insurance routinely reimburses the entity for the full price of the medication, and the entity is able to retain the difference between the reduced price it pays for the drug and the full amount for which it is reimbursed. In recent years, this practice and other aspects of the 340B Program have come under increased scrutiny, and the federal government is expected to propose guidance that will address key policies issues regarding the integrity of the 340B Program. Although we are not direct participants in the 340B Program and related services accounted for less than 0.1% of our revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our involvement with hospitals that are covered entities could cause reputational harm as a result of increased controversy regarding the 340B Program. In addition, if hospitals decrease their utilization of the 340B Program, whether due to regulatory changes or increased scrutiny, such decrease would impact revenue from this business.\nWe may be unable to obtain or retain the right to use or successfully integrate third-party licenses in our technology-based products, which could limit the number and type of products we are able to offer our customers.\nWe rely on third-party licenses for some of the technology used in our products, and intend to continue licensing technologies from third parties. Most of these licenses can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time. We may not be able to continue to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain or renew these licenses or find suitable alternatives could delay development of new products or prevent us from selling our existing products until suitable substitute technology can be identified, licensed, integrated or developed by us. We cannot assure you as to when we would be able to do so, if at all.\nMost of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive. Our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology to attempt to compete more effectively with us. In addition, our use of third-party technologies exposes us to risks associated with the integration of components from various sources into our products, such as unknown software errors or defects or unanticipated incompatibility with our systems and technologies. Further, we are dependent on our vendors' continued support of the technology we use. If a vendor chooses to discontinue or is unable to support a licensed technology, we may not be able to modify or adapt our products to fit other available technologies in a timely manner, if at all.\nRisks Related to Our Pending Acquisition of BioRx\nCompletion of the BioRx acquisition is subject to conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the acquisition will not be completed.\nThe obligations of ours and the sellers to the purchase agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including approval of the listing on the NYSE of our common stock to be issued, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing conditions. If the closing conditions are not waived or satisfied within 100 days, in the case of sellers' representative, or 120 days, in the case of Diplomat, any non-breaching party may terminate the purchase agreement.\nThe failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the acquisition could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the acquisition is successfully completed within its expected timeframe. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the acquisition will be satisfied or waived, or that the acquisition will be completed. The market price for our stock may reflect an assumption that the pending acquisition will occur, and the failure to complete the acquisition could result in a decline in our stock price.\nCombining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized.\nWe and BioRx have operated and, until the completion of the acquisition, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the acquisition, including anticipated benefits, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the business of BioRx with our business. It is possible that the pendency of the acquisition and/or the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, higher than expected costs, diversion of management attention of both BioRx and us, the disruption of either company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on (i) each of us and BioRx during this transition period and (ii) the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the acquisition.\nIn connection with the acquisition, we may incur significant additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility, and will increase our interest expense.\nWe had no outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility at December 31, 2014. Our pro forma indebtedness as of December 31, 2014, after giving effect to the acquisition and the anticipated incurrence of indebtedness in connection therewith, will be as much as $210 million. We will have substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the acquisition in comparison to that of us on a recent historical basis, which could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our interest expense. We will also incur various costs and expenses associated with the financing. The amount of cash required to pay interest and/or principal on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources, will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the transaction. The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the acquisition could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we do not achieve the\nexpected benefits from the acquisition, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nMoreover, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThe acquisition will involve substantial costs.\nWe and BioRx have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with the acquisition and combining the operations of the two companies. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will be comprised of transaction and regulatory costs related to the acquisition. We also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including purchasing and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the acquisition and the integration of the two companies' businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. See the risk factor entitled \"-Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized\" above.\nSales of shares of our common stock after the completion of the transaction and expiration of the lock-up period may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nWe would issue approximately 4.1 million shares of our common stock upon the initial closing of the transaction, and up to an additional 1.3 million shares of our common stock upon BioRx's achievement of a specified EBITDA-based target in the 12-month period following the closing. Although all sellers will be subject to a lock-up agreement preventing them from selling our common stock received at closing for a period of at least six months following closing, certain sellers may decide not to hold the shares of Company common stock they will receive in the acquisition to the extent permitted. Other sellers, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of our common stock that they receive in the acquisition as soon as permitted. Such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock and may take place promptly following the expiration of the respective lock-up periods, or promptly upon receipt with respect to the Contingent Consideration.\nUncertainties associated with the acquisition may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees of BioRx or us, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company following the acquisition.\nWe and BioRx are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined company's success after the acquisition will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of ours and BioRx. Current and prospective employees of BioRx and ours may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the acquisition, which may materially adversely affect the ability of each of us and BioRx to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the acquisition. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees of ours and BioRx.\nRisks Related to Federal and State Laws and Regulations\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and must comply with a significant number of complex and evolving requirements. Changes in state and federal government regulation could restrict our ability to conduct our business and cause us to incur significant costs.\nThe marketing, sale and purchase of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and provision of healthcare services generally are extensively regulated by federal and state governments. In addition, other aspects of our business are also subject to government regulation. The applicable regulatory framework is complex, and the laws are very broad in scope. Many of these laws remain open to interpretation and have not been addressed by substantive court decisions. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our interpretation would prevail or that one or more government agencies will not interpret the applicable laws and regulations differently. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing law can have a dramatic effect on our operations, our cost of doing business and the amount of reimbursement we receive from governmental third-party payors such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nSome of the healthcare laws and regulations that apply to our activities include:\n\u2022 The federal \"Anti-Kickback Statute\" prohibits individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully paying, offering, receiving or soliciting money or anything else of value in order to induce the referral of patients or to induce a person to purchase, lease, order, arrange for, or recommend services or goods covered in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid, or other government healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is an intent-based statute and the failure of a business arrangement to satisfy all elements of a safe harbor will not necessarily render the arrangement illegal, but it may subject that arrangement to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities. Any violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute can lead to significant penalties, including criminal penalties, civil fines and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\u2022 The \"Stark Law\" prohibits physicians from making referrals to entities with which the physicians or their immediate family members have a \"financial relationship\" (i.e., an ownership, investment or compensation relationship) for the furnishing of certain Designated Health Services that are reimbursable under Medicare. The Stark Law is a broad prohibition on certain business relationships, with detailed exceptions. However, unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute under which an activity may fall outside a safe harbor and still be lawful, a referral for Designated Health Services that does not fall within an exception is strictly prohibited by the Stark Law. A violation of the Stark Law is punishable by civil sanctions, including significant fines and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\u2022 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\"HITECH\") provide federal privacy protections for individually identifiable health information. See \"-Our business operations involve the substantial receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals. A failure to adequately protect any of this information could result in severe harm to our reputation and subject us to significant liabilities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\" below.\n\u2022 Pharmacies and pharmacists must obtain state licenses to operate and dispense pharmaceuticals. If we are unable to maintain our licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on non-resident pharmacies, this could limit or affect our ability to operate in some states.\n\u2022 Federal and state investigations and enforcement actions continue to focus on the health care industry, scrutinizing a wide range of items such as joint venture arrangements, referral and billing practices, product discount arrangements, home health care services, dissemination of confidential patient information, clinical drug research trials and gifts for patients.\nLegislative or regulatory policies designed to manage healthcare costs or alter healthcare financing practices or changes to government policies in general may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOccasionally, certain legislative and/or regulatory proposals are made which seek to manage the cost of healthcare, including prescription drug cost. Such proposals include \"single-payor\" government funded healthcare, changes in reimbursement rates, restrictions on rebates and discounts, restrictions on access or therapeutic substitution, limits on more efficient delivery channels, taxes on goods and services, price controls on prescription drugs and other significant healthcare reform proposals. Further, more exacting regulatory policies and requirements specific to the specialty pharmacy sector may cause a rise in costs, labor, and time to meet all such requirements. We are unable to predict whether any such policies or proposals will be enacted, or the specific terms thereof. Certain of these policies or proposals, if enacted, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business operations involve the substantial receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals. A failure to adequately protect any of this information could result in severe harm to our reputation and subject us to significant liabilities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMost of our activities involve the receipt or use of protected health information concerning individuals. We also use aggregated and de-identified data for research and analysis purposes, and in some cases, provide access to such de-identified data to pharmaceutical manufacturers, payors and third-party data aggregators and analysts. We believe our de-identified data is proprietary and we expect our future operations will include additional services regarding the de-identified data we accumulate to take greater advantage of our relationships with data-driven pharmaceutical manufacturers.\nThere is substantial regulation at the federal and state levels addressing the use, disclosure and security of patient identifiable health information. At the federal level, HIPAA and the regulations issued thereunder impose extensive requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by all participants in health care delivery, including physicians, hospitals, insurers and other payors. Many of these obligations were expanded under HITECH, passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Failure to comply with standards issued pursuant to federal or state statutes or regulations may result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In addition to regulating privacy of individual health information, HIPAA includes several anti-fraud and abuse laws, extends criminal penalties to private health care benefit programs and, in addition to Medicare and Medicaid, to other federal health care programs, and expands the Office of Inspector General's authority to exclude persons and entities from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, future regulations and legislation that severely restrict or prohibit our use of patient identifiable or other information could limit our ability to use information critical to the operation of our business. If we violate a patient's privacy or are found to have violated any federal or state statute or regulation with regard to confidentiality or dissemination or use of protected health information, we could be liable for significant damages, fines or penalties and suffer severe reputational harm, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. These risks may become more prominent as we provide additional services related to our de-identified data.\nThere remains considerable uncertainty as to the full impact of the Health Reform Laws on our business.\nMany of the structural changes enacted by the Health Reform Laws were implemented in 2014; however, some of the applicable regulations and sub-regulatory guidance have not yet been issued and/or finalized. Therefore, there remains considerable uncertainty as to the full impact of the Health Reform Laws on our business. While these reforms may not affect our business directly, they affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan customers. As a result, they could indirectly impact many of our services and business practices. We cannot predict what\neffect, if any, the Health Reform Laws, related regulations and sub-regulatory guidance may have on our business.\nRisks Related to Governance Matters\nCertain provisions of our corporate governance documents, Michigan law and the voting agreement among the Hagerman family and Rowe family could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These include provisions that, among other things:\n\u2022 permit the Board to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may determine (including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in control);\n\u2022 provide that the authorized number of directors may be fixed only by the Board in accordance with our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022 do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election);\n\u2022 divide our Board into three staggered classes;\n\u2022 provide that all vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022 prohibit removal of directors without cause;\n\u2022 prohibit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders;\n\u2022 requires unanimous consent for stockholders to take action by written consent without approval of the action by our Board;\n\u2022 provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide advance notice in writing and also comply with specified requirements related to the form and content of a shareholder's notice;\n\u2022 require at least 80% supermajority shareholder approval to alter, amend or repeal certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation; and\n\u2022 require at least 80% supermajority shareholder approval in order for shareholders to adopt, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of the Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing members of our management. Any matters requiring the approval of our shareholders will require the approval of the Hagerman family and the Rowe family (as defined below), which may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders. See \"-Philip Hagerman, our chairman and chief executive officer, will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted for shareholder approval and may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders.\"\nIn addition, the award agreements for outstanding stock options under our 2007 Option Plan generally provide that all unvested options will immediately vest upon a change in control. The\nOmnibus Plan permits the Board of Directors or a committee thereof to accelerate, vest or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to outstanding equity awards, in the event of, or immediately prior to, a change in control. Such vesting or acceleration could discourage the acquisition of our Company.\nWe could also become subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Michigan law which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not an acquisition or merger is desired by or beneficial to our shareholders. If a corporation's board of directors chooses to \"opt-in\" to certain provisions of Michigan Law, such corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% of the corporation's outstanding voting shares unless the holder has held the shares for five years or more or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the business combination. Our Board of Directors has not elected to be subject to this provision, but could do so in the future. Any provision of our amended and restated articles of incorporation or bylaws or Michigan law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock otherwise.\nPhilip Hagerman, our chairman and chief executive officer, has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted for shareholder approval and may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders.\nPhilip Hagerman and certain members of his immediate family and various trusts affiliated with or for the benefit of such persons (together with Philip Hagerman, the \"Hagerman family\") and the Rowe family beneficially own approximately 56.7% of our common stock as of March 2, 2015, and members of the Hagerman family and the Rowe family vote as a group (based on the voting determination of a majority of the shares held by the Hagerman family and the Rowe family, which Philip Hagerman holds) pursuant to a voting agreement. Therefore, Philip Hagerman will continue to have effective control over the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by shareholders, including the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws and approval of a sale of the Company and other significant corporate transactions, regardless of how other shareholders vote on these matters. Furthermore, the interests of the Hagerman family may be different than the interests of other shareholders. This concentration of voting power could also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 14954, "SIC": 5912, "TIC": "DPLO"}
