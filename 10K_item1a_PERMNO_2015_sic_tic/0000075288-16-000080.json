{"cik": "75288", "company": "OXFORD INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below highlight some of the factors that could materially affect our operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, prospects and/or operating results may be adversely affected. These are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. We operate in a competitive and rapidly changing business environment, and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and our success depends on the reputation and value of our brand names and our ability to offer innovative and market appropriate products that respond to rapidly changing fashion trends; any failure to maintain the reputation or value of our brands, to offer innovative, fashionable and desirable brands and products and/or to appropriately respond to competitive factors within our industry could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and our success depends on the reputation and value of our brand names. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are the reputation, value and image of brand names; design; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service. We believe that our ability to compete successfully is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference, and presenting appealing products for consumers.\nThe value of our brands could be diminished by actions taken by us or by our wholesale customers or others who have an interest in the brands, including by failing to respond to emerging fashion trends or meet consumer quality expectations; by selling products bearing our brands through distribution channels that are inconsistent with the retail channels in which our customers expect to find those brands; by becoming overly promotional; or by setting up consumer expectations for promotional activity for our products. We are becoming more reliant on social media as one of our marketing strategies and the value of our brands could be adversely affected if we do not effectively communicate our brand message through social media vehicles that interface with our consumers on a regular basis. In addition, we cannot always control the marketing and promotion of our products by our wholesale customers or other third parties and actions by such parties that are inconsistent with our own marketing efforts or that otherwise adversely affect the appeal of our products could diminish the value or reputation of one or more of our brands and have an adverse effect on our sales and business operations.\nDuring Fiscal 2015, Tommy Bahama\u2019s and Lilly Pulitzer\u2019s net sales represented 68% and 21%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. The limited diversification in our portfolio may heighten the risks we face if one of our brands fails to meet our expectations and/or is adversely impacted by any actions we or third parties take with respect to that brand or by competitive conditions in the apparel industry.\nAlthough certain of our products carry over from season to season, the apparel industry is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands. Due to the competitive nature of the apparel industry, there can be no assurance that the demand for our products will not decline or that we will be able to successfully evaluate and adapt our products to align with consumer preferences and changes in consumer demographics. Any failure on our part to develop and market appealing products could result in weakened financial performance and/or harm the reputation and desirability of our brands and products.\nThe highly competitive apparel industry, characterized by low entry barriers, includes numerous domestic and foreign apparel designers, manufacturers, distributors, importers, licensors and retailers, some of whom are also our customers and/or are significantly larger, are more diversified and have significantly greater financial resources than we do. Certain of our competitors offer apparel for sale at lower initial price points than our products and/or at significant discounts, particularly in response to weak economic conditions, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in significant pricing pressure within the apparel industry. This has been exacerbated by structural headwinds in the department store and specialty retail sectors, where the growth of fast fashion and value fashion retailers and expansion of off-price retailers has shifted consumer expectations to lower priced products from traditional, well-known brands. Competitive factors within the apparel industry may result in reduced sales, increased costs, lower prices for our products and/or decreased margins.\nWe also license certain of our brands to third party licensees. While we enter into comprehensive license and similar collaborative agreements with third parties covering product design, product quality, sourcing, distribution, manufacturing and marketing requirements and approvals, there can be no guarantee our brands will not be negatively impacted through our association with products outside of our core apparel products, by the market perception of the third parties with whom we associate and/or due to the actions of a licensee. The improper or detrimental actions of a licensee could significantly impact the perception of our brands.\nIn addition, the reputation of our brands could be harmed if our third party manufacturers and vendors, substantially all of which are located outside the United States, fail to meet appropriate product safety, product quality and social compliance standards, including the terms of our applicable codes of conduct and vendor compliance standards. We cannot assure that our manufacturers and vendors will at all times conduct their operations in accordance with ethical practices or that the products we purchase will always meet our safety and quality control standards. Any violation of our applicable codes of conduct or local laws relating to labor conditions by our manufacturers or vendors or other actions or failures by us or such parties may result in negative public perception of our brands or products, as well as disrupt our supply chain, which may adversely affect our business operations.\nThe apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic conditions, and a deterioration or worsening of consumer confidence or consumer purchases of discretionary products may adversely affect our business and financial condition, including as a result of adverse business conditions for third parties with whom we do business.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Demand for our products may be significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending, which may be influenced by employment levels, recessions, fuel and energy costs, interest rates, tax rates and changes in tax laws, personal debt levels, stock market volatility, general political conditions, including the impact domestically and internationally of shifts in political conditions that may result from a change in presidential and/or congressional regime, and other factors. The factors impacting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending are outside of our control and difficult to predict, and, often, the apparel industry experiences longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy. Any deterioration or worsening of consumer confidence or discretionary consumer spending could reduce our sales and/or adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAdditionally, significant changes in the operations or liquidity of any of the parties with which we conduct our business, including suppliers, customers, trademark licensees and lenders, among others, now or in the future, or in the access to capital markets for any such parties, could result in lower demand for our products, lower sales, higher costs or other disruptions in our business.\nIn response to technological advancements, retailers are shifting how they interact with their consumers and facilitate transactions, and our ability to execute our direct to consumer retail strategies in our branded businesses and/or the effect of the shift in the manner in which retail consumers transact business, subjects us to risks that could adversely affect our financial results and operations.\nCertain of our brands distribute products through bricks and mortar retail stores and e-commerce websites and regularly communicate with consumers through social media and other methods of digital marketing. One of our key initiatives is to grow our branded businesses through retail strategies that allow our consumers to access our brands whenever and wherever they choose to shop. Our success depends to a large degree on our ability to introduce new retail concepts and products, locate new retail locations with the proper consumer demographics, establish the infrastructure necessary to support growth, source appropriate levels of inventory, hire and train qualified personnel, anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing technology to align with our consumers\u2019 shopping preferences and maintain brand specific websites and other social media presence that offer the functionality and security customers expect.\nIn addition, in response to technological advancements, retail consumers have shifted their shopping behavior in recent years, with computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices facilitating retail transactions anywhere in the world and allowing greater consumer transparency in product pricing and competitive offerings from other retailers. As a result, retailers have been forced to shift the way in which they do business, including development of applications for electronic devices; improvement of guest-facing technology; one-day or same-day delivery of products purchased online (including through the enhancement of inventory management systems and their interface with e-commerce websites, the development and more efficient use of additional distribution facilities, either owned or provided by a third party, and in-store enhancements that facilitate shipment of e-commerce transactions from traditional bricks and mortar retail locations); free shipping of e-commerce transactions; greater and more fluid inventory availability between online transactional businesses and bricks and mortar retail locations; and greater consistency in marketing and pricing strategies for online and traditional bricks and mortar retail operations, including with respect to the retail pricing strategies of a retailer\u2019s own product offerings and those of its wholesale customers.\nThe continuing shift in the manner in which consumers transact business globally and our efforts to respond to these changes and execute our direct to consumer retail strategies could adversely affect our financial results and operations as a result of, among other things: investment in technology and infrastructure, which is extremely complex, in order to remain competitive (including investments to maintain modern technology and functionality similar to that provided by our competitors and expected by our customers); reliance on outdated technology that is not as appealing or functionally effective as those of our competitors; an inability to provide customer-facing technology systems, including mobile technology solutions, that function reliably and provide a convenient and consistent experience for our customers; our own e-commerce business and/or third party offers diverting sales from our bricks and mortar retail stores, where we have made substantial capital expenditures on leasehold improvements and have significant remaining long-term financial commitments, and rendering the traditional retail model more challenging financially; decision making with respect to the wholesale customers to whom we are willing to sell our products in order to maintain a consistent brand message and pricing strategy; our own promotional activity and pricing strategies; any failure to properly communicate our brand message or recreate the ambiance of our retail stores through social media; a reliance on third party service providers for software, processing and similar services; liability for our online content; credit card fraud; and failure of computer systems, theft of personal consumer information and computer viruses. The rapid dissemination of information and opinions in the current marketplace through social media and other platforms also increases the challenges of responding to negative perceptions or commentary about our brands or products. If we are unable to properly manage these risks and effectively respond to the behavioral shift in consumer expectations, we may lose sales and/or our reputation and credibility may be damaged.\nLoss of one or more of our key wholesale customers, or a significant adverse change in a customer\u2019s financial performance or financial position, could negatively impact our net sales and profitability.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our wholesale sales from a few key customers. For example, during Fiscal 2015, 46% of our consolidated wholesale sales or 16% of our consolidated net sales were to our five largest customers. Over the last several years, there have been significant levels of store closures by large retailers, increased prevalence and emphasis on private label products at large retailers, direct sourcing of products by large retailers, consolidation of a number of retailers and increased competition experienced by our wholesale customers from online competitors. A decrease in the number of stores that carry our products, restructuring of our customers\u2019 operations, continued store closures by major department stores, direct sourcing and greater leverage by customers, realignment of customer affiliations or other factors could negatively impact our net sales and profitability.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with any of our wholesale customers. Instead, we rely on long-standing relationships with these customers, the appeal of our brands and our position within the marketplace. As a result, purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis, and each relationship can generally be terminated by either party at any time. A decision by one or more of our key wholesale customers to terminate its relationship with us or to reduce its purchases from us, whether motivated by competitive considerations, quality or style issues, financial difficulties, economic conditions or otherwise, or our own decision to terminate or curtail our sales to a particular customer, for brand protection or otherwise, could adversely affect our net sales and profitability, as it would be difficult to immediately, if at all, replace this business with new customers, reduce our operating costs or increase sales volumes with other existing customers.\nIn addition, due to long product lead times, our product lines are typically designed and manufactured in anticipation of orders for sale. We make commitments for production in connection with these lines up to several months prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers, and if orders do not materialize or are canceled, we may incur expenses to terminate our production commitments or incur losses in order to dispose excess inventories. While we try to manage inventory risk by soliciting firm commitments from our wholesale customers, as the direct to consumer channels of distribution continue to represent a greater proportion of our consolidated net sales, our ability to mitigate the risks associated with our production commitments is tempered.\nWe also extend credit to most of our key wholesale customers without requiring collateral, which results in a large amount of receivables from just a few customers. At January 30, 2016, our five largest outstanding customer balances represented $28 million, or 48% of our consolidated receivables balance. Companies in the apparel industry, including some of our customers, may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and reorganizations, tightened credit markets and/or declining sales and profitability. A significant adverse change in a customer\u2019s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer\u2019s receivables or limit our ability to collect amounts related to shipments to that customer.\nWe rely to a large extent on third party producers in foreign countries to meet our production demands and failures by these producers to meet our requirements, the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices and/or changes in international trade regulation may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, disrupt our supply chain or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.\nWe source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third party producers located in foreign countries, including sourcing approximately 62% of our product purchases from China during Fiscal 2015. Although we place a high value on long-term relationships with our suppliers, generally we do not have long-term supply contracts but, instead, conduct business on an order-by-order basis. Therefore, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers. We regularly depend on the ability of third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity, and in some cases, the products we purchase and the raw materials that are used in our products are available only from one source or a limited number of sources. Although we monitor production in third party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis; given the production time and shipment time for goods for a particular season, if scheduled shipments from our suppliers are missed, there will not be time for another vendor to produce replacement goods. This would jeopardize our ability to service our customers and properly merchandise our direct to consumer channels, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales.\nIn addition, due to our sourcing activities, we are exposed to risks associated with changes in the laws and regulations governing the importing and exporting of apparel products into and from the countries in which we operate. These risks include changes in social, political, labor and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers are located; the imposition of additional or new duties, tariffs, taxes, quota restrictions or other changes and shifts in sourcing patterns as a result of such changes; significant delays in the delivery of our products, due to security or other considerations; fluctuations in sourcing costs; the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties; fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies; changes in customs procedures for importing apparel products; and restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries. We may not be able to offset any disruption or cost increases to our supply chain as a result of any of these factors by shifting production to suitable manufacturers in other jurisdictions in a timely manner or at acceptable prices, and future regulatory actions or changes in international trade regulation may provide our competitors with a material advantage over us.\nBreaches of information security or privacy could damage our reputation or credibility and cause us financial harm.\nAs an ongoing part of our business operations, including direct to consumer transactions and marketing through various social media tools, we regularly collect and utilize sensitive and confidential personal information, including of our customers, employees and suppliers and including credit card information. The routine operation of our business involves the storage and transmission of customer personal information, preferences and credit card information, and we use social media and other online activities to connect with our customers. The regulatory environment governing our use of individually identifiable data of customers, employees and others is complex, and the security of personal information is a matter of public concern.\nCybersecurity attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or disrupt our systems. Despite our implementation of security measures, if an actual or perceived data security breach occurs, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, vandalism, human error or otherwise, the image of our brands and our reputation and credibility could be damaged. The costs to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems and vulnerabilities, including to comply with security or other measures under state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or to resolve any litigation, and to enhance cybersecurity protection through organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants could be significant and result in significant financial losses and expenses, as well as lost sales.\nAs part of our routine operations, we also contract with third party service providers to store, process and transmit personal information of our employees and customers. Although we contractually require that these providers implement reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur at their location or within their systems. Privacy breaches of confidential information stored or used by our third party service providers may expose us to negative publicity, as well as potential out-of-pocket costs which could materially adversely affect our business and customer relationships.\nIn addition, privacy and information security laws and requirements change frequently, and compliance with them or similar security standards, such as those created by the payment card industry, may require us to modify our operations and/or incur costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative processes. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or similar security standards, could lead to fines, penalties or adverse publicity.\nOur business depends on our senior management and other key personnel, and the unsuccessful transition of key management responsibilities, the unexpected loss of individuals integral to our business, our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or our failure to successfully plan for and implement succession of our senior management and key personnel may have an adverse effect on our operations, business relationships and ability to execute our strategies.\nOur senior management has substantial experience and expertise in the apparel and related industries, with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Thomas C. Chubb III having worked with our company for more than 25 years, including in various executive management capacities. Our success depends upon disciplined execution at all levels of our organization, including our senior management, and continued succession planning. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense, and we compete to attract and retain these individuals with other companies that may have greater financial resources than us. While we believe that we have depth within our management team, the unexpected loss of any of our senior management, or the unsuccessful integration of new leadership, could harm our business and financial performance.\nAs we have previously announced, we introduced a new chief executive at Tommy Bahama at the beginning of fiscal 2016 and will officially have a new chief executive at Lilly Pulitzer starting in April 2016, with their predecessors retiring from their respective positions. Although the new executives at Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer have each been with their respective businesses for over 10 years and we believe that the transition of leadership was made according to carefully executed succession plans, any unsuccessful assumption of additional leadership responsibilities by either of these individuals or their respective teams, many of whom are taking on additional responsibilities, could materially adversely affect our operations, business relationships and ability to execute our strategies.\nOur operations are reliant on information technology and any interruption or other failure, in particular at one of our principal distribution facilities, may impair our ability to provide products to our customers, efficiently conduct our operations, and meet the needs of our management.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology. Information systems are used in all stages of our operations and as a method of communication with our customers, service providers and suppliers. Additionally, each of our operating groups utilizes e-commerce websites to sell goods directly to consumers. Our management also relies on information systems to provide relevant and accurate information in order to allocate resources and forecast and report our operating results. Service interruptions may occur as a result of a number of factors, including power outages, consumer traffic levels, computer viruses, hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties, disasters, or failures to properly install, upgrade, integrate, protect, repair or maintain our various systems and e-commerce websites.\nWe regularly evaluate upgrades or enhancements to our information systems to more efficiently and competitively operate our businesses. We may experience difficulties during the implementation, upgrade or subsequent operation of our systems and/or not be equipped to address system problems. Any material disruption in our information technology systems, or any failure to timely, efficiently and effectively integrate new systems, could have an adverse affect on our business or results of operations.\nWe may additionally have a greater risk than our peers due to the concentration of our distribution facilities. The primary distribution facilities that we operate are: a distribution center in Auburn, Washington for our Tommy Bahama products; a distribution center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania for our Lilly Pulitzer products; and distribution centers in Toccoa, Georgia and Lyons, Georgia for our Lanier Apparel products. Each of these distribution centers relies on computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks. Our ability to support our direct to consumer operations, meet customer expectations, manage inventory and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of these brand-focused distribution facilities, each of which manages the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of finished goods for one of our operating groups.\nIf any of our primary distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, including as a result of natural or man-made disasters, cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses or otherwise, if our distribution facilities fail to upgrade their technological systems to ensure efficient operations, or if we are unable to receive goods in a distribution center or to ship the goods in a distribution center, as a result of a technology failure or otherwise, we could experience a reduction in sales, a substantial loss of inventory or higher costs, insufficient inventory at our retail stores to meet consumer expectations and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products. In addition, for the distribution facilities that we operate, there are substantial fixed costs associated with these large, highly automated distribution centers, and we could experience reduced operating and cost efficiencies during periods of economic weakness. Any disruption to our distribution facilities or in their efficient operation could negatively affect our operating results and our customer relationships.\nOur business is subject to various federal, foreign, state and local laws and regulations, and the costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our costs or operations.\nIn the United States, we are subject to stringent standards, laws and other regulations, including those relating to health, product performance and safety, labor, employment, including provisions relating to health insurance for our employees under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in 2010, privacy and data security, anti-bribery, consumer protection, taxation, customs, logistics and similar operational matters. In addition, operating in foreign jurisdictions, including those where we may operate retail stores, requires compliance with similar laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, in the United States and abroad, are complex and often vary widely by jurisdiction, making it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently or will in the future be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, and unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations by us, or any of our suppliers or licensees, may restrict our ability to import products, require a recall of our products, lead to fines or otherwise increase our costs, negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, materially limit our ability to operate our business or result in adverse publicity.\nIn addition, like many retailers, we are impacted by trends in litigation, including class action litigation brought under various consumer protection and employment laws and are subject to various claims and pending or threatened lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings, and regardless of the outcome or whether the claims have merit, legal proceedings may be expensive and require our management devote significant time to defend.\nAlso, the restaurant industry requires compliance with a variety of federal, state and local regulations. In particular, all of our Tommy Bahama restaurants serve alcohol and, therefore, maintain liquor licenses. Our ability to maintain our liquor licenses depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The loss of a liquor license would adversely affect the profitability of a restaurant. Additionally, as a participant in the restaurant industry, we face risks related to food quality, food-borne illness, injury, health inspection scores and labor relations.\nRegardless of whether any allegations of violations of the laws and regulations governing our business are valid or whether we ultimately become liable, we may be materially affected by negative publicity associated with these issues. For example, the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to allegations of violations at one of our restaurants may extend beyond the restaurant involved to affect some or all of the other restaurants, as well as the image of the Tommy Bahama brand as a whole.\nFurthermore, as a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Compliance with these regulations requires us to devote time and management resources to institute corporate processes and compliance programs and to update these processes and programs in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements and could affect the manner in which we operate our businesses. We cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. We could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation, or our brand reputation could suffer, either as a result of a failure to comply with any of these regulations or our disclosures in response to these regulations.\nThe acquisition of new businesses and the divestiture or discontinuation of businesses and product lines have certain inherent risks, including, for example, strains on our management team and unexpected costs resulting from the transaction.\nGrowth of our business through acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model is a component of our business strategy. Generally, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including: the current competitive climate for suitable acquisition candidates, which is driving market multiples; the benefits of the acquisition not materializing as planned or not materializing within the time periods or to the extent anticipated; our ability to manage the people and processes of an acquired business; difficulties in retaining key relationships with customers and suppliers; risks in entering geographic markets and/or product\ncategories in which we have no or limited prior experience; and the possibility that we pay more to consummate an acquisition than the value we derive from the acquired business.\nAs a result of acquisitions, we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence. Although we may be entitled to indemnification against undisclosed liabilities from the sellers of the acquired business, our recourse may be limited and we cannot be certain that the indemnification, even if obtained, will be enforceable or collectible. Any of these liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, integrating acquired businesses is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. The integration process for newly acquired businesses could create for us a number of challenges and adverse consequences associated with the integration of product lines, employees, sales teams and outsourced manufacturers; employee turnover, including key management and creative personnel of the acquired and existing businesses; disruption in product cycles for newly acquired product lines; maintenance of acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; operating business in new geographic territories; diversion of the attention of our management from other areas of our business; and the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired and existing businesses. Merger and acquisition activity is inherently risky, and we cannot be certain that any acquisition will be successful and will not materially harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nAdditionally, acquisitions may cause us to incur debt or make dilutive issuances of our equity securities; cause large one-time expenses; or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future. In connection with acquisitions, we would also make various estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our estimates or assumptions are not accurate, we may suffer losses that could be material.\nFrom time to time, we also divest or discontinue businesses and/or product lines that do not align with our strategy or provide the returns that we expect or desire. For example, during Fiscal 2015, we sold the operations and assets of our former Ben Sherman operating group. Disposition transactions, as well as the discontinuation of business and/or product lines, may result in underutilization of our retained resources if the exited operations are not replaced with new lines of business, either internally or through acquisition. In addition, we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities, some of which may be triggered or increased by a purchaser\u2019s operation of the disposed business following the transaction. Those liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to grow our business through organic growth, and any failure to successfully execute this aspect of our business strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOne key component of our business strategy is organic growth in our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands. Organic growth may be achieved by, among other things, increasing sales in our direct to consumer channels; selling our products in new markets, including international markets; increasing our market share in existing markets, including to existing wholesale customers; expanding the demographic appeal of our brands; and increasing the product offerings within our various operating groups, including, for example, our ongoing emphasis to develop and grow Tommy Bahama\u2019s women\u2019s business. Successful growth of our business is subject to, among other things, our ability to implement plans for expanding our existing businesses at satisfactory levels. We may not be successful in achieving suitable organic growth, and our inability to grow our business may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have and intend to continue to make significant investment in growing our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, which includes investment in technology and infrastructure; retail stores and restaurants; office and distribution center facilities; and personnel. These investments may not yield the full benefits we anticipate and/or sales growth may be outpaced by increases in operating costs, putting downward pressure on our operating margins and adversely affecting our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other intellectual property, as well as certain contractual arrangements, including licenses, and other proprietary intellectual property rights, have significant value and are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition by retailers and consumers. In Fiscal 2015, 90% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to branded products for which we own the trademark. Therefore, our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property. We rely on laws in the United States and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. However, we may not be able to sufficiently prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United\nStates. The use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm the reputation of our brands.\nFrom time to time, we discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products, that otherwise infringe on our proprietary rights or that otherwise seek to mimic or leverage our intellectual property. These activities typically increase as brand recognition increases, especially in markets outside the United States. Counterfeiting of our brands could divert away sales, and association of our brands with inferior counterfeit reproductions could adversely affect the integrity and reputation of our brands.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. As we extend our brands into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of our distribution and marketing, we could become subject to litigation or challenge based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event a claim of infringement against us is successful or would otherwise affect our operations, we may be required to pay damages, royalties or license fees or other costs to continue to use intellectual property rights that we had been using, or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time. Litigation and other legal action of this type, regardless of whether it is successful, could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of the attention of our management and other resources.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nAs a global apparel company, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We record our income tax liability based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations, which requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation. In addition, we may from time to time modify our operations in an effort to minimize our global income tax exposure. Our effective income tax rate in any particular period or in future periods may be affected by a number of factors, including among others a shift in the mix of revenues, income and/or losses among domestic and international sources during a year or over a period of years; changes in tax laws and regulations and/or international tax treaties; the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions; the realization of any anticipated net operating loss carryforwards; and the resolution of uncertain tax positions, any of which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nIn addition, a number of proposals for broad reform of the United States corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies. Although it is not possible to accurately determine the overall effect of these recommendations and proposals on our effective tax rate, changes such as these may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFluctuations and volatility in the cost and availability of raw materials, labor and freight may materially increase our costs.\nWe and our third party suppliers rely on the availability of raw materials at reasonable prices. The principal fabrics used in our business are cotton, linens, wools, silk, other natural fibers, synthetics and blends of these materials. The prices paid for these fabrics depend on the market price for raw materials used to produce them. In addition, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, such as dyes and chemicals, and other costs, can fluctuate. In recent years, we have seen increases in the costs of certain raw materials, particularly cotton, as a result of weather-related supply disruptions, significant declines in U.S. inventory and a sharp rise in the futures market for cotton. We historically have not entered into any futures contracts to hedge commodity prices.\nIn recent years, we have also seen increases in the cost of labor at many of our suppliers, particularly with the growth of the middle class in certain countries, as well as in freight costs. In China, for example, apparel manufacturers have experienced increased costs due to labor shortages and other factors, and these increased costs are often passed on to us. Although we attempt to mitigate the effect of increases in our cost of goods sold through sourcing initiatives and by selectively increasing the prices of our products, these product costing pressures, as well as other variable cost pressures, may materially increase our costs, and we may be unable to fully pass on these costs to our customers.\nWe may not be successful in identifying locations and negotiating appropriate lease terms for retail stores and restaurants.\nAn integral part of our strategy has been to develop and operate retail stores and restaurants for certain of our lifestyle brands. Net sales from our retail stores and restaurants were 49% of our consolidated net sales during Fiscal 2015, and we expect to increase the number of our retail stores during Fiscal 2016 and in future years.\nWe lease all of our retail store and restaurant locations. Successful operation of our retail stores and restaurants depends, in part, on our ability to identify desirable, brand appropriate locations, the overall ability of the location to attract a consumer\nbase sufficient to make store sales volume profitable, our ability to negotiate satisfactory lease terms and employ qualified personnel, and our ability to timely construct and complete any build-out and open the location in accordance with our plans. We compete with others for these favorable store locations, lease terms and desired personnel. If we are unable to identify new locations with consumer traffic sufficient to support a profitable sales level or the local market reception to a new retail store opening is inconsistent with our expectations, retail growth may be limited. Further, any decline in the volume of consumer traffic at our retail stores and restaurants, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in consumer shopping preferences or technology, a decline in the popularity of malls or lifestyle centers in general or at those in which we operate, the closing of anchor stores or other adjacent tenants, or otherwise, could have a negative impact on our sales, gross margin, and results of operations.\nOur retail store and restaurant leases generally represent long-term financial commitments, with substantial costs at lease inception for a location\u2019s design, leasehold improvements, fixtures and systems installation. From time to time, we seek to downsize or close some of our retail store or restaurant operations, which may require a modification or termination of an existing lease; such actions may require payment of exit fees and/or result in fixed asset impairment charges, the amounts of which could be material.\nIn addition, our retail store and restaurant leases generally grant the third party landlord with discretion on a number of operational matters, such as store hours and construction of our improvements. The recent consolidation within the commercial real estate development, operation and/or management industries may reduce our leverage with those parties, thereby adversely affecting the terms of future leases for our retail stores and restaurants or making entering into long-term commitments with such parties cost prohibitive.\nIn recent years, we have expanded our Tommy Bahama direct to consumer operations into international markets; these efforts may continue to adversely impact our results of operations.\nStarting in Fiscal 2012, we expanded our Tommy Bahama retail operations into international markets, specifically in the Asia-Pacific region and in Canada. While we continue to look for additional, brand-appropriate locations for retail stores in these markets, particularly in Australia and Canada in the near term, we have also undertaken exploratory efforts to identify suitable third party distribution partners in various international markets. Our Tommy Bahama international infrastructure has had, and will continue to have, a negative impact on our operating results until we are able to fully scale our infrastructure costs and generate sufficient sales and other income through those operations to offset the requisite infrastructure costs.\nWe have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices related to international operations and there are risks associated with doing business in these markets, including lack of brand recognition in certain markets; understanding fashion trends and satisfying consumer tastes; understanding sizing and fitting in these markets; market acceptance of our products, which is difficult to assess immediately; establishing appropriate market-specific operational and logistics functions; managing compliance with the various legal requirements; staffing and managing foreign operations; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; obtaining governmental approvals that may be required to operate; potentially adverse tax implications; and maintaining proper levels of inventory. If we are unable to properly manage these risks or if our international efforts do not prove successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations could continue to be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the local laws of the foreign countries into which we enter. If any of our international operations, or our employees or agents, violates such laws, we could become subject to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nIn the future, we may elect to operate in certain international markets through joint ventures with third parties or retail license and/or wholesale distribution arrangements with third parties. Any such arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including our reliance on the operational skill and expertise of a local operator, the ability of the joint venture or operator to manage its employees and appropriately represent our brands in those markets, and any protective rights that we may be forced to grant to the third party, which could limit our ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of such a relationship.\nOur geographical concentration of retail stores and wholesale customers for certain of our products exposes us to certain regional risks.\nOur retail locations are heavily concentrated in certain geographic areas in the United States, including Florida and California for our Tommy Bahama retail stores (52 out of 141 domestic stores in these states as of January 30, 2016) and Florida for our Lilly Pulitzer retail stores (12 out of 34 stores as of January 30, 2016). Additionally, a significant portion of our wholesale sales for Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer products are concentrated in the same geographic areas as our own retail store locations\nfor these brands. Due to this concentration, we have heightened exposure to factors that impact these regions, including general economic conditions, weather patterns, natural disasters, changing demographics and other factors.\nOur business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels.\nWe schedule production from third party manufacturers based on our expectations for the demand for our products. However, we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory, which may result in inventory markdowns or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices and through off-price channels. These events could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands. Conversely, we may not be in a position to order quality products from our manufacturers in a timely manner and/or we may experience inventory shortages as demand for our products increases, which might result in unfilled orders, negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost sales, any of which could harm our business.\nWe hold licenses for the use of other parties\u2019 brand names, and we cannot guarantee our continued use of such brand names or the quality or salability of such brand names.\nWe have entered into license and design agreements to use certain trademarks and trade names, such as Kenneth Cole, Dockers, Geoffrey Beene and Nick Graham, to market some of our products. During Fiscal 2015, sales of products bearing brands licensed to us accounted for 6% of our consolidated net sales and 53% of our Lanier Apparel net sales. When we enter into these license and design agreements, they generally provide for short contract durations (typically three to five years); these agreements often include options that we may exercise to extend the term of the contract but, when available, those option rights are subject to our satisfaction of certain contingencies (e.g., minimum sales thresholds) that may be difficult for us to satisfy. Competitive conditions for the right to use popular trademarks means that we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these licenses on acceptable terms upon expiration, that the terms of any renewal will not result in operating margin pressures or reduced profitability, or that we will be able to acquire new licenses to use other desirable trademarks. The termination or expiration of a license agreement will cause us to lose the sales and any associated profits generated pursuant to such license, which could be material, and in certain cases could also result in an impairment charge for related assets.\nOur license agreements generally require us to receive approval from the brand\u2019s owner of all design and other elements of the licensed products we sell prior to production, as well as to receive approval from the brand owner of distribution channels in which we may sell and the manner in which we market and distribute licensed products. Any failure by us to comply with these requirements could result in the termination of the license agreement.\nIn addition to certain compliance obligations, all of our significant licenses provide minimum thresholds for royalty payments and advertising expenditures for each license year, which we must pay regardless of the level of our sales of the licensed products. If these thresholds are not met, our licensors may be permitted contractually to terminate these agreements or seek payment of minimum royalties even if the minimum sales are not achieved. In addition, our licensors produce their own products and license their trademarks to other third parties, and we are unable to control the quality of these goods that others produce. If licensors or others do not maintain the quality of these trademarks or if the brand image deteriorates, or the licensors otherwise change the parameters of design, pricing, distribution or marketing, our sales and any associated profits generated by such brands may decline.\nWe make use of debt to finance our operations, which exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial position and operating results.\nOur levels of debt vary as a result of the seasonality of our business, investments in our operations and working capital needs. As of January 30, 2016, we had $44.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. In the future, our debt levels may increase under our existing facilities or potentially under new facilities, or the terms or forms of our financing arrangements may change.\nOur indebtedness includes, and any future indebtedness may include, certain obligations and limitations, including the periodic payment of principal and interest, maintenance of certain covenants and certain other limitations. The negative covenants in our debt agreements limit our ability to incur debt, guaranty certain obligations, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase common stock, make investments, including the amount we may generally invest in, or use to support, our foreign operations, sell assets, make acquisitions, merge with other companies, or satisfy other debt. These obligations and limitations may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and limit our flexibility in carrying out our business plan and planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate.\nIn addition, we have interest rate risk on indebtedness under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. Our exposure to variable rate indebtedness may increase in the future, based on our debt levels and/or the terms of future financing arrangements. An increase in interest rates may require us to pay a greater amount of our funds from operations towards interest, even if the amount of borrowings outstanding remains the same. As a result, we may have to revise or delay our business plans, reduce or delay capital expenditures or otherwise adjust our plans for operations.\nThe continued growth of our business, including the completion of potentially desirable acquisitions, also depends on our access to sufficient funds. We typically rely on cash flow from operations and borrowings under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and investment activities. As of January 30, 2016, we had $185.9 million in unused availability under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. If the need arises in the future to finance expenditures in excess of those supported by our operations and existing credit facilities, we may need to seek additional funding, whether through debt or equity financing. Our ability to obtain that financing will depend on many factors, including prevailing market conditions, our financial condition and, depending on the sources of financing, our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions. The terms of any such financing or our inability to secure such financing could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategies.\nLabor-related matters, including labor disputes, may adversely affect our operations.\nWe may be adversely affected as a result of labor disputes in our own operations or in those of third parties with whom we work. Our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner, and our new retail store and restaurant growth is dependent on timely construction of our locations. While we are not subject to any organized labor agreements and have historically enjoyed good employee relations, there can be no assurance that we will not experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future with our non-unionized employees. In addition, potential labor disputes at independent factories where our goods are produced, shipping ports, or transportation carriers create risks for our business, particularly if a dispute results in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak manufacturing, shipping and selling seasons. For example, a severe and prolonged disruption to ocean freight transportation, such as the disruption to West Coast port operations in 2014 and 2015 due to a port workers\u2019 union dispute, delayed our receipt of product. Further, we plan our inventory purchases and forecasts based on the anticipated timing of retail store and restaurant openings, which could be delayed as a result of a number of factors, including labor disputes among contractors engaged to construct our locations or within government licensing or permitting offices. Any potential labor dispute, either in our own operations or in those of third parties on whom we rely, could materially affect our costs, decrease our sales, harm our reputation or otherwise negatively affect our operations.\nOur international operations, including foreign sourcing and retail operations, result in an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are exposed to certain risks in conducting business outside of the United States. The substantial majority of our orders for the production of apparel in foreign countries is denominated in U.S. dollars. If the value of the U.S. dollar decreases relative to certain foreign currencies in the future, then the prices that we negotiate for products could increase, and it is possible that we would not be able to pass this increase on to customers, which would negatively impact our margins. However, if the value of the U.S. dollar increases between the time a price is set and payment for a product, the price we pay may be higher than that paid for comparable goods by competitors that pay for goods in local currencies, and these competitors may be able to sell their products at more competitive prices. Additionally, currency fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and difficult to finance.\nWe received U.S. dollars for more than 95% of our product sales during Fiscal 2015. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies in which we have sales could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of operations, although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts in prior periods. In addition, to the extent that a stronger U.S. dollar increases costs, and the products are sold in another currency but the additional cost cannot be passed on to our customers, our gross margins will be negatively impacted.\nOur operations may be affected by changes in weather patterns, natural or man-made disasters, war, terrorism or other catastrophes.\nOur sales volume and operations may be adversely affected by unseasonable or severe weather conditions, natural or man-made disasters, war, terrorist attacks, including heightened security measures and responsive military actions, or other catastrophes which may cause consumers to alter their purchasing habits or result in a disruption to our operations. Because of the seasonality of our business, the concentration of a significant proportion of our retail stores and wholesale customers in certain\ngeographic regions, the concentration of our sourcing operations and the concentration of our distribution operations, the occurrence of such events could disproportionately impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others.\nWe may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others. Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, may not align with our business strategies and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers and other third parties.", "PERMNO": 34948, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "OXM"}
