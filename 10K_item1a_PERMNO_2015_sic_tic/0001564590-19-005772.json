RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with all the other information in this report, including our financial statements and notes thereto, before you invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually materializes, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nIn assessing these risks, you should also refer to other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\n1) RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL\nWe have incurred significant losses, and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses as we continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are an early stage commercial biopharmaceutical company. We launched our first commercial products in 2018 and continue to incur significant expenses related to commercialization, our ongoing and planned future clinical studies, research and development activities, selling, general and administrative activities and charges relating to Bevyxxa. Our operating expenses increased during the year of 2018, and we do not anticipate a significant decrease in the near term. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.5 billion.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities, collaborations, including a loan from one of our collaboration partners, a sale of a royalty stream from future product sales, sales of commercial and development rights to some of our product candidates, and to a lesser extent, government grants, equipment leases, venture debt and with the benefit of tax credits made available under a federal stimulus program supporting drug development. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to product commercialization, research and development, including manufacturing and clinical studies. We anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial expenses as we:\n\u2022\nestablish and scale-up manufacturing capabilities and a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize our products in the U.S. and abroad;\n\u2022\ninitiate or continue clinical studies, including a post-marketing randomized controlled trial of Andexxa;\n\u2022\ncontinue the research and development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek to discover or in-license additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies; and\n\u2022\nenhance operational, compliance, financial, quality and information management systems and hire more personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates and support our commercialization efforts.\nTo be profitable in the future, we must succeed in commercializing our products and developing and commercializing other products with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of activities, including manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and any other products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, obtaining additional regulatory approvals and successfully completing clinical studies. We are only in the preliminary stages of some of these activities. We may not succeed in these activities and may never generate revenue that is sufficient to be profitable in the future. Even if we are profitable, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to achieve sustained profitability would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product candidates, market our product candidates, if approved, or continue our operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. Due to the recent approval by the FDA of our products and the absence of historical sales data, our product sales will be difficult to predict from period to period and as a result, you should not rely on sales results in any period as being indicative of future performance and sales may be below the expectation of securities analysts or investors in the future. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of demand and market acceptance;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour abilities to obtain desired regulatory approvals in the U.S., EU and other foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which coverage and reimbursement is available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed care programs and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nrebates, discount, other pricing concessions and fees that we may provide to integrated delivery networks, group purchasing organizations, other purchasers and pharmacy benefits managers and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nthe timing, cost and level of investment in our marketing efforts to support sales;\n\u2022\nthe timing, cost and level of investment in our research and development activities involving approved products and product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing, distribution and the amount of legally mandated discounts to government entities, other discounts and rebates, product returns and other gross-to-net deductions;\n\u2022\nthe risk/benefit profile, cost and reimbursement of existing and potential future drugs which compete with approved products;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of non-cash items such as stock compensation expenses, reserves, cost of goods sold and non-recurring charges such as inventory write-offs; and\n\u2022\nexpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue or earnings guidance we may provide.\nWe will need additional funds to support our operations, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, which would force us to delay, reduce or suspend our research and development programs and other operations or commercialization efforts. Raising additional capital may subject us to unfavorable terms, cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations, reduce future profitability or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates and technologies.\nWe will continue to require substantial funds to support commercial operations and pursue further research and development efforts. Our financing requirements will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nproduct sales of Andexxa, and if approved for commercial marketing, our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution and general corporate and commercial infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of international expansion;\n\u2022\nthe timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe possible development of additional product candidates, including through in-licensing and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe degree and rate of market acceptance of any products launched by us or partners;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing, commercialization or other financing arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements;\n\u2022\nthe rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies; and\n\u2022\nthe emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other financing, marketing and distribution arrangements. Additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or it may not be available on favorable terms.\nIf we raise additional capital through financing, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing or other financial arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and our repayment obligations may reduce future financial performance. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or suspend one or more of our clinical studies, research and development programs or commercialization efforts.\nOur obligations under our credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, so if we default on those obligations, the lenders could foreclose on our assets. As a result of these security interests, such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent at a time when the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our indebtedness and other obligations. Additionally, our credit facility contains restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business.\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement by and among us, the guarantor and lenders (\u201cLenders\u201d) party thereto, and HCR Collateral Management, LLC, as Administrative Agent, dated February 28, 2019 (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as Collateral Agent for the Lenders, has been granted a security interest in\nsubstantially all of our assets. As a result, if we default under our obligations to the Lenders, the Collateral Agent could foreclose on its security interest and liquidate some or all of these assets, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event of a default in connection with our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization, the Collateral Agent would have a prior right to substantially all of our assets to the exclusion of our general unsecured creditors. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations under the Credit Facility, resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of any unsecured indebtedness. Only after satisfying the claims of the Lenders and any unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders. Events of default under the Credit Facility include, among other things, our failure to pay any amounts due under the Credit Facility or any of the other loan documents, a breach of covenants under the Credit Facility, our insolvency, a material adverse effect occurring, the occurrence of certain defaults under certain other indebtedness for which we are obligated or certain final judgments against us.\nThe pledge of these assets and other restrictions imposed in the Credit Facility may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged to secure the Credit Facility obligations, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility.\nIf we are unable to comply with certain financial and operating restrictions in the Credit Facility, we may be limited in our business activities and access to credit or may default under the Credit Facility.\nProvisions in the Credit Facility impose restrictions or require prior approval on our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022Incur additional debt;\n\u2022Make certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022Guarantee the indebtedness of others or our subsidiaries;\n\u2022Create liens or encumbrances;\n\u2022Engage in new lines of business;\n\u2022Enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022Pay cash dividends and make distributions;\n\u2022Redeem or repurchase capital shares;\n\u2022Sell, lease or transfer certain parts of our business or property;\n\u2022Prepay other indebtedness; and\n\u2022Acquire new companies and merge or consolidate.\nThe Credit Facility also contains other customary covenants, including covenants that require us to maintain a minimum cash balance of up to $40 million, dependent on borrowings and levels of sales of Andexxa. We may not be able to comply with these covenants in the future. Our failure to comply with these covenants may result in the declaration of an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may result in the acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility and would require us to pay all amounts outstanding. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds then available for repayment or we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms\nacceptable to us or at all. Our failure to repay our indebtedness would result in the Collateral Agent foreclosing on all or a portion of our assets and possibly force us to curtail or cease our operations.\n2) RISKS RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AND MARKETING OPERATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES\nOur products may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nOur success depends heavily on the launch and commercialization of our products. The commercial success of our products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third-party payors as clinically useful, cost-effective and safe. The degree of market acceptance of any drug depends on a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nefficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe price we charge for our products;\n\u2022\ninterpretations of the results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of physicians and healthcare organizations to change their current treatment practices;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of hospitals and hospital systems to include our products as treatment options;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to pay for our products, including co-pays under their health coverage plans;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement.\nFailure to attain market acceptance among the medical community and third-party payors may have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. If we are not successful in commercializing Andexxa, our future product revenue will suffer, we may incur significant additional losses and our business will be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to develop effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities on our own or through collaborations or other marketing partners, we will not be successful in commercializing our products or our other future products.\nWe are still in the early stages of developing our sales and marketing infrastructure. To achieve commercial success for our products or any current or potential product candidate, we must continue to develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. We plan to market expand our hospital-based sales force in other major markets and work with partners in other parts of the world to commercialize our products globally. There are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services.\nWe also may not be successful entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively, which could damage our reputation. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new therapeutic products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to commercializing our products and developing our current product candidates, and we will face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide.\nWhile there are no therapies other than Andexxa approved specifically as antidotes for Factor Xa inhibitors, we are aware of at least one drug candidate that has been studied in early stage clinical trials as a potential antidote to Factor Xa inhibitors. In addition, Andexxa may compete with the off-label use of other treatments designed to enhance coagulation, such as FFP, PCCs, rFVIIa or whole blood. Although there is no approved indication for these products in patients taking Factor Xa inhibitors, physicians may choose to use them because of familiarity, cost or other reasons. In addition, we are aware that several companies have conducted preclinical research on compounds intended to be antidotes for Factor Xa inhibitors.\nFor Bevyxxa, several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies currently market and sell direct or indirect anticoagulants for use in various disease states, including injectable anticoagulants for the prevention of VTE in acutely ill medical patients. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Some of these competitors are or may be attempting to develop therapeutics for our target indications.\nIn addition, most of our competitors are large pharmaceutical companies that will have a greater ability to reduce prices for their competing drugs in an effort to gain or maintain market share and undermine the value proposition that we might otherwise be able to offer to payors. Bevyxxa is indicated for the prophylaxis of VTE in adult patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness who are at risk for thromboembolic complications due to moderate or severe restricted mobility and other risk factors. The current standard of care for VTE prophylaxis in acute medically ill patients in the United States is a 6- to 14-day administration of enoxaparin, marketed as Lovenox and also available in generic form. Enoxaparin is a low cost therapy that is widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. As a result of this and other factors, we have faced initial difficulties in marketing Bevyxxa in this patient population. Additionally, our competitors may have the financial and other resources to conduct additional clinical studies in an effort to obtain regulatory approval for use of their drugs for VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients. For example, Bayer and Janssen recently published results from their Phase 3 MARINER clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban for up to 45 days post hospital discharge (after enoxaparin in hospital) to reduce the risk of symptomatic VTE in medical ill patients. If the results of Bayer and Janssen\u2019s clinical studies support a successful path to regulatory approval, Bevyxxa is expected to face increased competition in the marketplace from a drug that would be used as a different treatment strategy (post discharge only) in an overlapping patient population. Such treatment strategy would not require physicians, patients and third-party payors to replace enoxaparin with a new or higher priced therapy in the hospital.\nThere are also a number of products in clinical development for hematologic cancer, ophthalmological diseases, allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma and other inflammatory or autoimmune diseases that are potential indications for cerdulatinib or selective Syk inhibitors. Our competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Many competing products are in later stages of development than our products and, therefore, may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products before we obtain approval for ours.\nMany of our competitors, including a number of large pharmaceutical companies that compete directly with us, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nWe obtained regulatory approval of Andexxa in the United States through an Accelerated Approval process. Continued approval is contingent upon post-marketing study.\nThe Accelerated Approval regulations allow drugs that are being developed to treat an unmet medical need to be approved substantially based on evidence of an effect on a biomarker endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit rather than a clinical endpoint such as survival or irreversible morbidity. Our approval of Andexxa was supported by data from two Phase 3 ANNEXA studies (ANNEXA-R and ANNEXA-A), which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Andexxa in reversing the anticoagulant activity of the Factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban in healthy volunteers, and interim patient data from our ongoing ANNEXA-4 single-arm, open-label study in patients on a Factor Xa inhibitor experiencing a life threatening or uncontrolled bleeding episode. However, these studies have inherent limitations as compared with a randomized controlled trial. As a condition to approval, the FDA has required us to conduct a post-marketing randomized controlled trial of Andexxa. This trial will randomize patients to receive either Andexxa or the type of care the enrolling institution would provide in the absence of Andexxa. This study has been opened to enrollment and we expect it to be reported in 2023. We expect the practical implementation and ethical considerations of a randomized controlled trial for Andexxa to present challenges, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully conduct and enroll such a trial in a manner satisfactory to the FDA or within the time period required by the FDA. Further, if the randomized controlled trial is not successful, the FDA could modify or withdraw our marketing approval for Andexxa.\nIf clinical studies of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our future product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical studies are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical studies could occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical studies that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical studies of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical studies may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate or patients may drop out of these clinical studies at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nclinical studies of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical studies or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical studies or the manufacturing of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nwe might have to suspend or terminate clinical studies of our product candidates for various reasons, including unanticipated serious side effects, other unexpected characteristics or unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nregulators may not approve our proposed clinical development plans;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical study or conduct a clinical study at a prospective study site;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical studies or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical studies of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these studies or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended;\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u2022\nbe subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used.\nOur product development costs may also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. We do not know whether any anticipated clinical studies will begin as planned, or whether anticipated or ongoing clinical studies will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant clinical study delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which would impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates and harm our business and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products internationally. Following the negative decision by the European Commission, we will not obtain marketing approval to commercialize Bevyxxa in the EU at this time, or potentially ever.\nIn order to market Andexxa, Bevyxxa or our future products in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. Specifically, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (\u201cMA\u201d). Before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.\nThe approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical studies conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. In addition, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to submit for regulatory approvals and even if we submit we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nOn March 1, 2019, the CHMP communicated a positive opinion for Conditional Approval of our MAA for Andexxa, to be marketed under the brand name Ondexxya in the EU. Based on the positive CHMP opinion, we expect an EC decision in the second quarter of 2019, although the CHMP opinion is not binding on the EC and there can be no assurance that the EC will provide such decision. We expect the EC decision for Conditional Approval, if obtained, will include several post-authorization requirements, including specific obligations to submit a final clinical study report for the randomized controlled trial of Andexxa (U.S.)/Ondexxya (EU), a final clinical study report for the ANNEXA-4 study, and an obligation to provide some additional pharmacokinetic data. The EC may not provide a positive decision and may also delay or further condition such decision. A negative EU outcome or significant delays in EU approval would materially harm our business.\nIn March 2018, the CHMP issued a negative opinion, recommending that the EMA reject the marketing application for Bevyxxa in the EU. We requested a re-examination of the initial opinion and in July 2018, we received a negative re-examination opinion from the CHMP. The European Commission adopted the CHMP decision in September 2018. Failure to obtain marketing approval of Bevyxxa in the EU will reduce the commercial potential of Bevyxxa and could also have a negative impact on our efforts to commercialize and obtain market acceptance for Bevyxxa in the US market.\nIf serious adverse side effects are identified with respect to any of our product candidates or either of our approved products, we may need to abandon our development of that product candidate or discontinue sale of that product.\nIt is impossible to guarantee when or if any of our product candidates will prove safe enough to receive regulatory approval. In addition, there can be no assurance that our clinical studies will identify all relevant safety issues. Known or previously unidentified adverse side effects can adversely affect regulatory approvals or marketing of approved products. In such an event, we might need to abandon marketing efforts or development of that product or product candidate or enter into a partnership to continue development.\nWhile no serious adverse side effects have been observed in our completed healthy subject studies with Andexxa, adverse effects have been observed in our ANNEXA-4 study in bleeding patients. Additionally, there is a risk that adverse events may be reported in our post-marketing randomized controlled trial of Andexxa, additional clinical experience or repeat doses that are determined to have been caused by Andexxa. Some protein-based biologics have encountered problems with immunogenicity, that is, their tendency to trigger an unwanted immune response against themselves. To date, no neutralizing antibodies against Andexxa or antibodies to Factor X or Xa have been detected; however there is still a risk that such antibodies could be identified through our ANNEXA-4 patient study results, additional clinical experience or from repeat doses. In addition, in our ANNEXA-4 patient trial, reversing the anticoagulant activity of Factor Xa inhibitors in patients with life threatening or uncontrolled bleeding who have underlying medical conditions requiring anticoagulation has been associated with thromboembolic events, ischemic events, cardiac arrest and sudden deaths, and the FDA has included a boxed warning in the Andexxa label to this effect.\nBevyxxa, like all currently marketed inhibitors of Factor Xa, carries some risk of life-threatening bleeding. In addition, patients taking Bevyxxa in our Phase 2 studies had an increased rate of gastrointestinal issues, such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and other side effects such as back pain, dizziness, headaches, rashes and insomnia as compared to subjects taking a placebo or an active comparator.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency it may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. Among other legal and administrative actions, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nmandate modifications to product labelling or promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022\nsuspend any regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, our partners or our potential future partners;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products or require a product recall.\nIn addition, the occurrence of any of the foregoing, even if promptly remedied, could negatively impact the perception of us or the relevant product among the medical community, patients or third-party payors.\nThe FDA\u2019s approval of Andexxa was limited to patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, and additional clinical studies and regulatory applications will be required to expand Andexxa indications. We can provide no assurances that such clinical studies or regulatory applications will be successful.\nWe are developing Andexxa as a universal antidote for patients receiving a Factor Xa inhibitor when reversal of anticoagulation is needed, such as in life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding or for emergency surgery/urgent procedures. Our approval of Andexxa was limited to patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Our studies have not yet included patients requiring emergency surgery or urgent procedures and we do not anticipate obtaining this indication without clinical data. We expect that we will also be required to provide additional clinical data to support addition to our label of other Factor Xa inhibitors, including Bevyxxa, edoxaban and enoxaparin. Additional clinical studies will\nrequire additional time and expense and may not prove successful. Limitations in our label for Andexxa will reduce the number of patients for whom Andexxa is indicated and could reduce the size of the anticipated market and our financial prospects. In addition, our label for Andexxa includes a boxed warning that treatment with Andexxa has been associated with serious and life-threatening adverse events, thromboembolic events, ischemic events, cardiac arrest and sudden deaths. This boxed warning may adversely impact market acceptance and the commercial potential of Andexxa. There can be no assurance that further clinical experience will provide a basis to remove this boxed warning.\n3) RISKS RELATED TO OUR RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES\nWe rely on single source third-party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply Andexxa, Bevyxxa and our product candidates for us. If one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to perform adequately or fulfill our needs, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to find new suppliers or manufacturers. We may also face significant delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe do not own facilities for clinical-scale or commercial manufacturing of our product candidates and we rely on third-party suppliers to manufacture Andexxa, Bevyxxa and our product candidates. For example, we have contracted with Lonza to manufacture Andexxa bulk drug substance and Baxter to manufacture drug product to support our commercial launch. We rely on Hovione to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Bevyxxa and Patheon Inc. (part of Thermo Fisher Scientific) to manufacture drug product to supply Bevyxxa. We also rely or expect to rely on other third party providers for raw materials, packaging, labeling and supply chain warehousing and distribution. If we and our suppliers cannot agree to the terms and conditions for them to provide the drug supply necessary for our clinical and commercial needs, or if any single source supplier breaches an agreement with us, or terminates the agreement in response to an alleged breach by us or otherwise becomes unable to fulfill its supply obligations, we would not be able to manufacture and distribute the product candidate until a qualified alternative supplier is identified, which could also significantly disrupt, delay the development of, and impair our ability to commercialize, our product candidates. In addition, lead times for our manufacturing and contractual requirements of our third-party manufacturers require us to estimate product demand in advance. If our forecasts are not accurate, we may experience shortfalls or surplus of product. If we do not manufacture enough product, we may experience stock-outs and interruption of supply of our products. If we manufacture a surplus of product, we may experience spoilage from product expiration and incur manufacturing expenses which were not required. We have fixed manufacturing commitments with our third-party manufacturers which are on a \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d basis which could require us to pay for manufacturing costs even if we eventually do not need the capacity forecasted at the time we entered into such commitments. The financial impact of either stock-outs or a product surplus could be significant with respect to financial commitments and the effect on our financial performance.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products in compliance U.S. and foreign regulatory manufacturing requirements, requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality assurance, including stability of the product candidate and quality control testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced regulatory requirements, other federal and state regulatory requirements and foreign regulations. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us or under applicable regulations and agreements, our ability to provide the drug supply necessary for our clinical studies and commercial needs would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical study materials could delay the completion of our clinical studies, increase the costs associated with maintaining our clinical study programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new studies at significant additional expense or terminate the studies completely.\nAll manufacturers of our product candidates must comply with regulatory manufacturing requirements enforced by the U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities through their facilities inspection programs. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our product candidates may be unable to comply with these manufacturing requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies may also\nimplement new standards at any time, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacturing, packaging or testing of products. We have limited control over our manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any product supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers\u2019 failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay or interruption of clinical studies, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, entail higher costs or adversely affect our reputation.\nAlthough alternative sources of supply exist, the number of third-party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities to manufacture biologics is limited, and it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. New suppliers of any product candidate would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing the product candidate. Obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or other qualifications under applicable regulatory requirements and ensuring non-infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could result in a significant interruption of supply and could require the new manufacturer to bear significant additional costs which may be passed on to us.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical studies, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such studies.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical studies of our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. We remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical studies is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the study.\nMoreover, the regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical studies to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of patients in clinical studies are protected. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully develop our products and our product candidates.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute supplies for our clinical studies. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future distributors could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe may enter into collaborations that place the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates outside our control, require us to relinquish important rights or may otherwise be on terms unfavorable to us, and if our collaborations are not successful, our product candidates may not reach their full market potential.\nWe may enter into additional collaboration agreements with third parties with respect to our product candidates for the commercialization of the candidates both inside and outside the United States, or for other purposes. For example, we have out-licensed development and commercial rights to Andexxa in Japan. In addition, depending on our capital requirements, development and commercialization costs, need for additional therapeutic expertise and other factors, it is possible that we will enter into broader development and commercialization arrangements with respect to our product candidates. Our likely collaborators for any distribution, marketing, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. We will have limited control over the amount and timing\nof resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue from these arrangements will depend in part on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to any such collaborations;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical study results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical studies, provide insufficient funding for a clinical study program, stop a clinical study, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical studies or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and a collaborator that causes the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that results in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and\n\u2022\ncollaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we may not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property.\nAny termination or disruption of our collaboration with potential collaborators could result in delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidates, increases in our costs to develop and commercialize the product candidate, or the termination of development of a product candidate.\n4) RISKS RELATED TO THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our key executives, and if we are not able to retain these members of our management, or retain or recruit additional management and other key personnel, our business will suffer.\nRecruiting and retaining leadership and other key personnel is critical to our success. Our former Chief Executive Officer, William Lis, retired in 2018 and our board of directors appointed Scott Garland to serve as our President and Chief Executive Officer. We are highly dependent on Mr. Garland and the other principal members of our executive and leadership teams. We may not be able to attract and retain management and other key personnel in the future, due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of personnel from universities, research institutions\nand technology companies. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our business strategies. Our consultants and advisors may also perform services for companies other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are not able to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nUnder the terms of their employment, our executives may terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of any of these people could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nWe expect to expand our development, regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nOver the next several years, we may experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, quality, commercial compliance, medical affairs, and sales and marketing. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to existing and new public company compliance and reporting regulations.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and those of The Nasdaq Stock Market, or the Nasdaq, have imposed various requirements on public companies including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Our management and other personnel have and will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations are continuously being revised, have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as applicable, requires us to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as applicable, requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our auditors as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to maintain an effective system of\ninternal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for our common stock, and could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nProduct liability lawsuits and claims against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit product sales.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical studies, and the commercial manufacturing, distribution and sale of Andexxa and Bevyxxa. For example, the manufacturers of currently marketed Factor Xa inhibitors and other manufacturers of anticoagulants have faced substantial litigation due to certain alleged bleeding risks. In addition, in our ANNEXA-4 patient trial, reversing the anticoagulant activity of Factor Xa inhibitors in patients with underlying medical conditions requiring anticoagulation has been associated with thromboembolic events, ischemic events, cardiac arrest and sudden deaths, and the FDA has included a boxed warning in the Andexxa label to this effect. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that Andexxa, Bevyxxa or our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of patients from clinical studies or cancellation of studies;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any additional products that we may develop.\nWe may not have sufficient insurance coverage for future product liability claims. We may not be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, harm our reputation in the industry, significantly increase our expenses, and reduce product sales. Product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product, product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on products, product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on sales, marketing and research programs and products and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other products or product candidates or other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product or product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights through collaboration, licensing, or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our\noperations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials. In addition, we may be required to incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our corporate headquarters is located in California near major earthquake faults. Our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake, fire or other natural or manmade disaster.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize any approved products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business. If any product candidates that we may develop are approved for commercialization outside the United States, we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndiffering payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems and price control;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nIn connection with our Andexxa and Bevyxxa development, we are currently utilizing certain suppliers outside of the United States, which subjects us to certain of the above risks.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to conduct critical operations and generally operate our business, which includes using information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, including customer, employee and company data. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. We also store certain information with third parties. Our information systems and those of our third-party vendors are subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber- or phishing-attacks and also are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks and external hazards. Disruption, degradation, or manipulation of these systems and infrastructure through intentional or accidental means could impact key business processes. Cyber-attacks against the Company\u2019s systems and infrastructure could result in exposure of confidential information, the modification of critical data, and/or the failure of critical operations. Likewise, improper or inadvertent employee behavior, including data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems, may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Any such breach could compromise our networks, and the information stored therein could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Such attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being lost or stolen, disruption of our operations, and other negative consequences, such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs, and diversion of management attention. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical study data from completed or ongoing clinical studies for any of our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. In addition, with planned operations in EU, we will need to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) provisions relating to personal data, use of third party processors, data breach notifications and transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States. The GDPR imposes large penalties for noncompliance and has the potential to increase our responsibility and liability in relation of personal data that we process, including in clinical trials, and we are required to put in place and maintain additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including increased company and vendor technology and data management measures and cybersecurity investments.\n5) RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to intellectual property license agreements with third parties, including with respect to Bevyxxa, cerdulatinib, and other early stage programs, and we expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that our future license agreements will impose, various supply, support, diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements or pursue other remedies, in which event we may not be able to develop and market any product that is covered by these agreements or be liable for damages. Termination of licenses or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms or our not having sufficient intellectual property rights to operate our business. The occurrence of such events could materially harm our business.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to obtain and maintain effective intellectual property rights for our technologies and product candidates.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and in other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. In some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or products that we license from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. In addition, if our current or future licensors, licensees, or\ncollaboration partners fail to establish or maintain such patents and other intellectual property rights, or lose rights to those patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated.\nWe have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles remain unresolved. In recent years patent rights have been the subject of significant litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or products or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or vice versa. Further, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act (\u201cAIA\u201d) implemented significant changes to United States patent law. The AIA could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our owned or in-licensed issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe have been and may again become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review, or other proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of our licensors, and the outcome of any proceedings are highly uncertain. For example, in November 2013, Zentiva k.s. and G\u00fcnter S\u00d6LCH separately filed papers with the European Patent Office opposing European Patent 2101760, assigned to Millennium to which we have an exclusive license. The European Patent Office decided in favor of revoking the European patent. Portola has appealed this revocation. Should any of these proceedings or appeals be unsuccessful, this could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner, or by successfully seeking to narrow or invalidate our patents or render them unenforceable. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, and may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a\nresult, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours or otherwise provide us with a competitive advantage.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension and data exclusivity for any product candidates we may develop, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidates we may develop, one or more of our owned or licensed U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar extensions as compensation for patent term lost during regulatory review processes are also available in certain foreign countries and territories, such as in Europe under a Supplementary Patent Certificate. However, we may not be granted an extension in the United States and/or foreign countries and territories because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. For example, we have applied for patent term extensions at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) within the applicable deadline after receiving approval for Andexxa and Bevyxxa, but have not yet received a final determination. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is shorter than what we request or we fail to choose the most optimal patents to extend, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors or other parties may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights or intellectual property of third parties. We may become party to, or be threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding third party intellectual property rights with respect to our products, product candidates, and technology, including interference proceedings before the USPTO. An interference proceeding is a proceeding before the USPTO to determine the priority among multiple patents or patent applications. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. Any litigation involving defense against claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of proprietary or intellectual property rights, regardless of the merit of such claims, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management time. If we are found to infringe a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to be willfully infringing a third party\u2019s patents. We may also be required to indemnify parties with whom we have contractual relationships against such claims. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. We also could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nEven if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our products or\nproduct candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties can have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, thus harming our business and competitive position.\nIn addition to our patented technology and products, we rely upon trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and our collaborators and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. However, it is possible that technology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. Furthermore, if the employees, consultants or collaborators that are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Further, our trade secrets could be disclosed, misappropriated or otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. In addition, intellectual property laws in foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If our trade secrets are disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed intellectual property of their former employers. Intellectual property litigation or proceedings could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other intellectual property-related proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\n6) RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. We will not be permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA or a BLA, from the FDA. Obtaining approval of an NDA or BLA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process that may not be successful. In addition, failure to comply with FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including the following:\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\ncivil or criminal penalties and fines;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical studies;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u2022\nrefusal to accept or approve applications for marketing approval of new drugs or biologics or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseizure or detention of our products or import bans.\nPrior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our product candidates in the United States or abroad, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical studies, and to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities abroad, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical studies can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we and our collaboration partners believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering any of our product candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or cause suspension of clinical studies of our product candidates and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications.\nRegulatory approval of an NDA or BLA is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. The regulatory authorities also have substantial discretion in the approval process. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical studies, or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical studies. The number of preclinical studies and clinical studies that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;\n\u2022\nFDA officials may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical studies sufficient;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may find our manufacturing data insufficient to support approval\n\u2022\nthe FDA might not approve our or our third-party manufacturer\u2019s processes or facilities; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf any of our product candidates fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical studies or does not gain regulatory approval, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely harmed.\nUnfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives could harm our business.\nThere is increasing pressure on biotechnology companies to reduce healthcare costs. In the U.S., these pressures come from a variety of sources, such as managed care groups, institutional, and government purchasers. Increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of federal healthcare programs and private sector beneficiaries could increase pricing pressures in the future. Such pressures may also increase the risk of litigation or investigation by the government regarding pricing calculations. The biotechnology industry will likely face greater regulation and political and legal action in the future.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new therapeutic products vary widely from country to country. Some countries, including many EU member countries, require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, including EU member countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. In\nsome foreign markets, including the EU member countries, current standard of care and/or competitive products may be used as a benchmark or reference to determine pricing and reimbursement level for novel products such as Andexxa and Bevyxxa. To the extent that comparators are available at lower prices than our anticipated pricing for Andexxa or Bevyxxa, the pricing and reimbursement level of our products in the EU could be negatively impacted. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenue we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country, or even reduce the commercial viability of the product to an extent that prevents the launch altogether.\nAdverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in Andexxa, Bevyxxa or one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval. Adverse pricing limitations prior to approval will also adversely affect us by reducing our commercial potential. Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments becomes available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels.\nA primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and these third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We are engaged in ongoing negotiations with hospitals and third-party payors regarding coverage, reimbursement and formulary placement. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with products administered under the supervision of a physician. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Payment rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government funded and private payors for our existing or new products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products or our product candidates.\nIn the United States, there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could affect our future revenue and profitability and the future revenue and profitability of our potential customers. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For example, one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in 2010. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes\nand fraud and abuse measures, all of which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. The Affordable Care Act, among other things:\n\u2022\nimposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell \u201cbranded prescription drugs,\u201d effective 2011;\n\u2022\nincreased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d, effective 2011;\n\u2022\nexpanded Medicaid drug rebates to cover drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nchanged the Medicaid rebate rates for line extensions or new formulations of oral solid dosage form;\n\u2022\nexpanded the types of entities eligible for the \u201cSection 340B discounts\u201d for outpatient drugs;\n\u2022\nrequired manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and\n\u2022\ncreated a process for approval of biologic therapies that are similar or identical to approved biologics and provides 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for biologics.\nLegislative changes to or regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible and appear likely in the 116th U.S. Congress and under the current administration. In addition, since January 2017, the President has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. On January 22, 2018, the President signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (\u201cBBA\u201d), among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Presidential administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. Moreover, several attempts have been made to reduce the length of exclusivity for biologic therapies, via federal government budget proposals and proposed legislation. For example, the Price Relief, Innovation, and Competition for Essential Drugs (\u201cPRICED\u201d) Act, introduced in 2016, would have reduced exclusivity for biological drugs from 12 to seven years. We cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, or Budget Control Act, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, which triggered the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs, including aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in April 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced\nMedicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nFurther, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While some of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Presidential administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nThere likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nour ability to set a price we believe is fair for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nPharmaceutical companies are heavily regulated by federal, state and local regulations in the countries in which business activities occur. Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to laws and regulations governing healthcare fraud and abuse, advertising and other promotional activities, data privacy and patient rights by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program provisions and the implementing regulations which will require, among other things, extensive tracking of physician and teaching hospital payments, maintenance of a payments database, and public reporting of the payment data;\n\u2022\nthe federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government;\n\u2022\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws governing data privacy and the EU general data privacy regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d);\n\u2022\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar statutes and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, which makes it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u2022\nthe Drug Quality and Security Act which requires manufacturers and other distribution parties to create systems to trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; and state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives.\nThe Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to substantial penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s planned withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on our business, global economic conditions, and financial markets.\nAs a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to leave the EU in March 2019, the EMA announced that it will relocate its headquarters from London to Amsterdam by March 30, 2019. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval of product candidates, disrupt the manufacture of our products and product candidates in the United Kingdom or the EU, disrupt the importation and export of active substances and other components of drug formulations, and disrupt the supply chain for clinical trial product and final authorized formulations. While negotiations continue regarding the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, the specific impact to the supervision, regulation and supply of medicines in the United Kingdom and Europe remain unclear. The cumulative effect of disruptions to the regulatory framework or supply chains may add considerably to the development lead time to, and expense of, marketing authorization and commercialization of products in the EU and/or the United Kingdom. In view of the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit implementation, we are unable to predict the effects of such disruption to the regulatory framework and supply chain in Europe.\n7) RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price may be volatile, and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and may be volatile in the future. The stock market in general, and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of revenues generated from sale of our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the expectations of investors related to the commercialization of our products and product candidates;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions or decisions, including the timing and outcome of any potential future FDA or EMA decision, or other products or product candidates, including those of our competitors;\n\u2022\ninaccurate sales or cash forecasting of our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials or regulatory actions with respect to our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other risks described in this \u201cRisk factors\u201d section.\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. In addition, following our update call on September 5, 2017, at least three plaintiffs\u2019 securities litigation firms publicly announced that they are investigating potential securities fraud claims that they may wish to make against us. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts may cease to publish research on our company at any time in their discretion. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. In addition, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If our operating results fail to meet the forecasts of analysts, our stock price will likely decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nour board of directors is divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms which may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change in control;\n\u2022\nour board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nour stockholders may not act by written consent or call special stockholders\u2019 meetings; as a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions other than at annual stockholders\u2019 meetings or special stockholders\u2019 meetings called by the board of directors, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer or the president;\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nstockholders must provide advance notice and additional disclosures in order to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; and\n\u2022\nour board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock; the ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOur agreements with our executive officers may require us to pay severance benefits to any of those persons who are terminated in connection with a change in control of us, which could harm our financial condition or results or discourage third parties from seeking business combinations.\nOur executive officers are parties to agreements that contain change in control and severance provisions providing for aggregate cash payments of up to approximately $6.6 million for severance and other benefits and acceleration of vesting of equity awards with a value of approximately $5.3 million as of December 31, 2018, based on the closing price of our common stock of $19.52 on such date in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change in control of us. The accelerated vesting of equity awards could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and harm the market price of our common stock. The payment of these severance benefits could harm our financial condition and results. In addition, these potential severance payments may discourage or prevent third parties from seeking a business combination with us.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of existing or any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 13940, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PTLA"}
