We have described below what we currently believe to be the material risks and uncertainties in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. We also face other risks and uncertainties beyond what is described below. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of securities, including our common stock, could decline significantly. You could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Company Sale to Penn National\nThe announcement and pendency of the Proposed Company Sale to Penn National may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties related to the Proposed Company Sale that may adversely affect our business, operating results and stock price, whether or not the Proposed Company Sale is completed, including: (1) having to focus the Company\u2019s management on the Proposed Company Sale, which could lead to disruption of the Company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in its services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, (2) potential difficulties in recruiting and retaining team members as a result of the transaction; (3) the transaction may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays, including those arising from legal proceedings related to the transaction; (4) our business, including our relationships with our guests, team members and suppliers, may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the Proposed Company Sale; (5) certain persons with whom the Company have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with the Company as a result of the Proposed Company Sale; (6) that we may be adversely affected by other economic, business or competitive factors during the time the Proposed Company Sale is pending; and (7) that the Penn National Merger Agreement contains provisions that place certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Proposed Company Sale, which may disrupt our current plans and operations, including plans for future growth, and/or adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures.\nIn connection with the Proposed Company Sale to Penn National, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary Form S-4 filed with the SEC allegedly contains material omissions and misstatements. The complaint seeks, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Proposed Company Sale until additional disclosures are made, and damages. While we believe that the allegations in this lawsuit are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against these allegations, we cannot assure you as to the outcome of this, or any similar future lawsuits, including the costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with litigation or settlement of these claims.\nBecause the Exchange Ratio is fixed and the market prices of Penn National Common Stock and Pinnacle Common Stock may fluctuate, our stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the Penn National Common Stock they will receive on the closing date.\nThe consideration that our stockholders will receive will be $20.00 in cash (plus, if the Proposed Company Sale is not consummated on or prior to October 31, 2018, $0.01 for each day during the period commencing on November 1, 2018 through the effective time of the Proposed Company Sale) and 0.42 share of Penn National Common Stock for every outstanding share of Pinnacle Common Stock and such Exchange Ratio will not vary based on the market price of Penn National Common Stock before the effective time of the Proposed Company Sale. If the market price of Penn National Common Stock declines prior to the closing of the Proposed Company Sale, the per share consideration our stockholders will receive could reflect a lower value than that upon which the Proposed Company Sale was valued at the time we entered into the Penn National Merger Agreement.\nThe Proposed Company Sale to Penn National may not be completed.\nThe Proposed Company Sale pursuant to which Penn National will acquire Pinnacle may not be completed as contemplated for a variety of reasons, including: (1) conditions to the closing of the transaction may not be satisfied; (2) the\noccurrence of an event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Penn National Merger Agreement; and (3) other risks to the consummation of the Proposed Company Sale.\nCompletion of the Proposed Company Sale is subject to certain conditions, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others: (1) receipt of the approval of stockholders of both Penn National and Pinnacle as required for the transaction, including the approval of the issuance of Penn National\u2019s common stock in connection with the Proposed Company Sale consideration; (2) the absence of any injunction, restraining order or other orders or laws prohibiting the consummation of the Proposed Company Sale; (3) the expiration or termination of any waiting period applicable to the Proposed Company Sale under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Acts of 1976, as amended; (4) the receipt of all required regulatory approvals in a timely manner (including receipt of necessary approvals from gaming regulatory authorities); (4) the registration of the shares of Penn National to be issued to stockholders of Pinnacle; and (5) the listing of the shares of Penn National on NASDAQ. The obligation of each party to consummate the Proposed Company Sale is also conditioned upon the accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties, the absence of a material adverse effect involving the other party, and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Penn National Merger Agreement.\nThe Penn National Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Penn National. If the Penn National Merger Agreement is terminated by either party because the stockholders of the Company fail to adopt the Penn National Merger Agreement, the Company will be required to pay a fixed expense reimbursement of $30.0 million to Penn National. The Company will be required to pay Penn National a termination fee equal to $60.0 million (less any expenses previously paid to Penn National in the case of a termination described in clause (iii) below) if the Penn National Merger Agreement is terminated (i) by Penn National because the Company\u2019s Board of Directors has made an adverse recommendation change, (ii) by the Company to accept and enter into a Company Superior Proposal (as defined in the Penn National Merger Agreement), and (iii) by Penn National or the Company because the stockholders of the Company fail to adopt the Penn National Merger Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal (as defined and adjusted in the Penn National Merger Agreement) had been publicly announced or becomes publicly known and not publicly withdrawn by at least 15 business days prior to the Company stockholders meeting to vote on the Penn National Merger Agreement, and within 12 months of such a termination the Company enters into or consummates a Company Takeover Proposal. Under certain circumstances, Penn National may be obligated to pay a termination fee to the Company, but such fee may not adequately compensate the Company for its losses.\nFailure to complete the Proposed Company Sale to Penn National could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of the Company.\nIf the Proposed Company Sale is not completed, the ongoing business of the Company may be adversely affected and the Company will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nhaving to pay certain costs relating to the Proposed Company Sale, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees; and\n\u2022\nthe Company will have forgone other opportunities in favor of the Proposed Company Sale and committed time and resources of its management to matters related to the Proposed Company Sale instead of pursuing such other opportunities that could be beneficial to the Company, including opportunities the Company is restricted from pursuing due to provisions in the Penn National Merger Agreement that place restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Proposed Company Sale, without realizing any of the benefits of having the Proposed Company Sale completed.\nIf the Proposed Company Sale is not completed, the Company cannot assure its stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect its business, financial results, and stock price.\nThe Penn National Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Proposed Company Sale, could discourage a potential competing acquirer of the Company from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require the Company to pay Penn National a termination fee of $60.0 million.\nThe Penn National Merger Agreement contains certain provisions that restrict the Company\u2019s ability to initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals, or offers regarding, or the making of a competing proposal, engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect to a competing proposal or furnish any non-public information to any person in connection with a competing proposal. Further, even if the Company\u2019s board of directors changes, withholds, modifies, withdraws or qualifies its recommendation with respect to the Penn National Merger Agreement proposal or the share issuance proposal, as applicable, unless the Company has terminated the Penn National Merger Agreement to accept and enter\ninto a Company Superior Proposal (as defined in the Penn National Merger Agreement), the Company will still be required to submit the adoption of the Penn National Merger Agreement to a vote at a special meeting of its stockholders. In addition, Penn National generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Penn National Merger Agreement in response to any third-party alternative transaction proposal before the Company\u2019s board of directors may change, withhold, modify, withdraw or qualify its recommendation with respect to the adoption of the Penn National Merger Agreement. In some circumstances, upon termination of the Penn National Merger Agreement, the Company will be required to pay a termination fee of $60.0 million to Penn National.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of the Company or pursuing an alternative transaction with the Company from considering or proposing such a transaction, even if, in the case of an acquisition of the Company, it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share price than the per share price proposed to be received in the Proposed Company Sale or might result in a potential third-party acquirer or merger partner proposing to pay a lower price to the stockholders of the Company than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the $60.0 million termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nThe completion of the transactions contemplated by the Penn National Merger Agreement may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which the Company is a party.\nIf the Company and Penn National are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if the Company and Penn National are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to the Company.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending as a result of downturns in the economy or other changes we cannot accurately predict.\nDemand for entertainment and leisure activities is sensitive to consumers\u2019 disposable incomes, and thus demand can be affected by changes in the economy that we cannot predict. We compete with a broad range of entertainment and leisure activities and consumer preferences may change. Perceived or actual unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, including recession, economic slowdown, high unemployment levels, housing and credit crises, high fuel or other transportation costs, and changes in consumer confidence may reduce disposable income of our customers or result in fewer patrons visiting our casinos. As a result, we cannot ensure that demand for entertainment and leisure activities will not be adversely affected or that customers will continue to want to frequent our facilities or continue to spend money at our facilities. Many of our younger customers do not play slot machines, which is where we derive the majority of our revenue. In the event that our customers do not use slot machines, this may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world, including a general tightening of the availability of credit, rising interest rates, increasing energy costs, rising prices, inflation, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, declining consumer confidence or significant declines in the stock market could lead to a reduction in discretionary spending on entertainment and leisure activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition, including through legislative legalization or expansion of gaming by states in or near where we operate facilities or through Native American gaming facilities and internet gaming, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe face significant competition in all of the areas in which we operate. Increased competitive pressures may adversely affect our ability to continue to attract customers or affect our ability to compete efficiently.\nSeveral of the facilities on which we operate are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas and/or may be affected by state laws that currently prohibit or restrict gaming operations. Economic difficulties faced by state governments could lead to intensified political pressures for the legalization of gaming in jurisdictions where it is currently prohibited. The legalization of gaming in such jurisdictions could be an expansion opportunity for us, or create competitive pressure, depending on where the legalization occurs and our ability to capitalize on it. Our ability to attract customers to the existing casinos on which we operate could be significantly and adversely affected by the legalization or expansion of gaming in certain jurisdictions, including, in particular, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia areas where our customers may also visit, and by the development or expansion of Native American casinos in areas where our customers may visit.\nVoters and state legislatures may seek to supplement traditional tax sources of state governments by authorizing or expanding gaming in those jurisdictions. We also face the risk that existing casino licensees will expand their operations and the risk that Native American gaming will continue to grow.\nOn October 30, 2017, Pennsylvania enacted legislation that expanded gaming by authorizing (i) up to 10 ancillary casinos which may each operate between 300 and 750 slot machine and initially up to 30 table games; (ii) the operation of up to five video gaming terminals at each truck stop that meets certain criteria; and (iii) the establishment of a program to permit internet gaming. This expansion of gaming in Pennsylvania may provide additional competition to the Meadows.\nFrom time to time, our competitors refurbish, rebrand or expand their casino offerings, which could function to increase competition. In addition, changes in ownership may result in improved quality of our competitors\u2019 facilities, which may make such facilities more competitive.\nWe also compete with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as bingo, pull-tab games, card parlors, sports books, pari-mutuel or telephonic betting on horse and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, instant racing machines, video lottery terminals (\u201cVLTs\u201d) (including racetracks that offer VLTs), video poker terminals and, in the future, we may compete with gaming or entertainment at other venues. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home, could divert customers from the facilities we operate and thus adversely affect our business. Such internet wagering services are likely to expand in future years and become more accessible to domestic gamblers as a result of U.S. Department of Justice positions related to the application of federal laws to intrastate internet gaming and initiatives in some states to consider legislation to legalize intrastate internet wagering. The law in this area has been rapidly evolving, and additional legislative developments may occur at the federal and state levels that would accelerate the proliferation of certain forms of internet gaming in the United States.\nOur gaming operations rely heavily on technology services provided by third parties. In the event that there is an interruption of these services to us, it may have an adverse effect on our operations and financial conditions.\nWe engage a number of third parties to provide gaming operating systems for the facilities we operate. As a result, we rely on such third parties to provide uninterrupted services to us in order to run our business efficiently and effectively. In the event one of these third parties experiences a disruption in its ability to provide such services to us (whether due to technological difficulties or power problems), this may result in a material disruption at the casinos on which we operate and have a material effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAny unscheduled interruption in our technology services is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations, cloud computing and lottery systems. Such interruptions may occur as a result of, for example, catastrophic events or rolling blackouts. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.\nOur business may be harmed from cyber security risk and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our guests\u2019 or our business partners\u2019 or our own information or other breaches of our information security.\nWe make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit guest information, or those of service providers, business partners, or employee information may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, our guests\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our guests\u2019 consent.\nIn addition, third party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our employees, guests, suppliers and other business partners. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers or business partners, may also be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, our business information, guest, supplier, and other business partner data may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their consent.\nAny such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, guests\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation, businesses, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Leases, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.\nWe are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to GLPI pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Leases. Under the Master Lease, the current annual aggregate rent payable by Pinnacle MLS, LLC, the tenant under the Master Lease, is $382.8 million. In addition, under the Meadows Lease, the current annual aggregate rent payable by PNK Development 33, LLC, the tenant under the Meadows Lease, is $25.8 million. As a result of our significant lease payments, our ability to fund our own operations or development projects, raise capital, make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, our obligations under the Leases may:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general or regional adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nreduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to raise capital, make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following are certain provisions, among others, of the Master Lease which restrict our ability to freely operate and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition:\n\u2022\nEscalations in Rent - We are obligated to pay base rent under the Master Lease, and base rent is composed of building base rent and land base rent. Every year of the Master Lease term, building base rent is subject to an annual escalation of up to 2% and we may be required to pay the escalated building base rent regardless of our revenues, profit or general financial condition.\n\u2022\nVariable Rent - We are obligated to pay percentage rent under the Master Lease, which is re-calculated every two years. Such percentage rent shall equal 4% of the change between (i) the average net revenues for the trailing two-year period and (ii) 50% of the trailing 12 months net revenues as of the month ending immediately prior to the execution of the Master Lease. We may be required to pay an increase in percentage rent based on increases in net revenues without a corresponding increase in our profits.\n\u2022\nNew Developments - If we contemplate developing or building a new facility which is located within a 60 mile radius of a facility that is subject to the Master Lease, the annual percentage rent due from the affected existing facility subject to the Master Lease may thereafter be subject to a floor. Therefore, our percentage rent may not decline as a result of a subsequent decline in revenues at the leased properties.\n\u2022\nGuaranty by Parent - In connection with certain assignments of the Master Lease, the ultimate parent company of such assignee of the Master Lease must execute a guaranty and shall be required to be solvent. Such requirement may limit our ability to freely assign the Master Lease or pursue certain transactions.\n\u2022\nMaster Lease Guaranties - The Master Lease is guaranteed by the tenant\u2019s parent and certain subsidiaries of the tenant (the \u201cLease Guarantors\u201d). A default under any of the Master Lease guaranties that is not cured within the applicable grace period will constitute an event of default under the Master Lease.\n\u2022\nCross-Defaults - If we or any of the Lease Guarantors fail to pay or bond final judgments aggregating in excess of $100 million, and such judgments are not discharged, waived or stayed within 45 days, an event of default will arise under the Master Lease.\n\u2022\nEffect of End of Term or Not Renewing the Master Lease - If we do not renew the Master Lease at the stipulated renewals or we do not enter into a new master lease at the end of the term, we will be required to sell the business of tenant. If we cannot agree upon acceptable terms of sale with a qualified successor tenant within a three month period after potential successive tenants are identified, GLPI will select the successor tenant to purchase our business through a competitive auction. If this occurs, we will be required to transfer our business to the highest bidder at the auction, subject to regulatory approvals.\nThe Meadows Lease contains provisions that are similar to many of the foregoing provisions of the Master Lease.\nSubstantially all of our gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with GLPI, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nWe lease 14 of the gaming facilities we operate pursuant to the Master Lease with GLPI and we lease the Meadows pursuant to the Meadows Lease with GLPI. The Leases provide that GLPI may terminate each lease for a number of reasons, including, subject to applicable cure periods, the default in any payment of rent, taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of any other covenant or agreement in the lease. Termination of either of the Leases could result in a default under our credit agreement with certain lenders, which is comprised of a term loan A facility with a maturity of five years, term loan B facility with a maturity of seven years and a revolving credit facility with a maturity of five years (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d and together with the term loan A facility and term loan B facility, the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) and the bond indenture governing our 5.625% senior notes due 2024 (\u201c5.625% Notes\u201d and together with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the \u201cDebt Agreements\u201d) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our obligations under the Leases in the future.\nEach of the Leases is a \u201ctriple-net lease.\u201d Accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay among other things the following: (i) all facility maintenance, (ii) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (iii) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor) and (iv) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for incurring the costs described in the preceding sentence notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall in part accrue to GLPI as owner of the associated facilities.\nIn addition, if some of our leased facilities should prove to be unprofitable, we could remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the Leases even if we decided to withdraw from those locations. We could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including lease termination costs, impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with growth and acquisitions.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets, through acquiring other gaming, hospitality and entertainment businesses or through redeveloping our existing locations. The expansion of our operations, whether through acquisitions, development or internal growth, could divert management\u2019s attention and could also cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal, professional and consulting fees. It is uncertain that we will be able to identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other problems. Additionally, it is uncertain that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or governmental approvals for our new projects or in jurisdictions that we have not operated in the past or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved. Further, we may not obtain adequate financing for such opportunities on acceptable terms. Finally, under the terms of the Penn National Merger Agreement, we have certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the\nProposed Company Sale, including with respect to growth and acquisition opportunities which may be beneficial to the Company.\nIf we make new acquisitions or new investments, we may face additional risks related to our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to satisfy our financial covenants and comply with other restrictive covenants under our Debt Agreements.\nWe derived 26.3% and 26.4% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 from our casinos located in Louisiana and Missouri, respectively, and are especially subject to certain risks, including economic and competitive risks, associated with the conditions in those areas and in the states from which we draw patrons.\nFour of our sixteen gaming facilities on which we operate are located in Louisiana. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived 26.3% of our revenues from these four casinos, including 13.1% from one of them, L\u2019Auberge Lake Charles in Lake Charles, Louisiana. In addition, we derived 26.4% of our revenues from our three casinos in Missouri during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nBecause we expect to derive a significant percentage of our revenues from operating facilities concentrated in two states, we are subject to greater risks from regional conditions than a gaming company operating facilities in several different geographies. A decrease in revenues from or increase in costs for any of these locations is likely to have a proportionally greater impact on our business and operations than it would for a gaming company with more geographically diverse facilities. Risks from regional conditions include the following:\n\u2022\nregional economic conditions;\n\u2022\nregional competitive conditions, including legalization or expansion of gaming in Louisiana or Missouri or in neighboring states;\n\u2022\nreduced land and air travel due to increasing fuel costs or transportation disruptions;\n\u2022\ninaccessibility of the area due to inclement weather, road construction or closure of primary access routes;\n\u2022\nthe outbreak of public health threats at any of our facilities, or in the areas in which they are located, or the perception that such threats exist; and\n\u2022\na decline in the number of visitors.\nOur present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could adversely affect our financial health; future cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our obligations, and we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing; and we may experience adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had indebtedness of $821.7 million, including $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Notes, $169.2 million in borrowings under our revolving commitment under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and $152.4 million in outstanding term loan borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In addition, we had $9.2 million in outstanding letters of credit under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2017.\nThere can be no assurance in the future that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or through asset sales to meet our expected long-term debt service obligations. Our indebtedness and projected future borrowings could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our expected indebtedness (including our obligations under the 5.625% Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Leases);\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing without restructuring the covenants in our expected indebtedness to permit the incurrence of such financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be used for payments on the debt (including our obligations under the 5.625% Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Leases) and related interest (as applicable), thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund other working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to respond to changing business, industry and economic conditions and to withstand competitive pressures, which may affect our financial condition;\n\u2022\ncausing us to incur higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates on our borrowings that have variable interest rates or in the event of refinancing existing debt at higher interest rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to make investments, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or the general economy and restricting us from making improvements or acquisitions or exploring business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less debt or greater resources; and\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Debt Agreements in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness (including our obligations under the 5.625% Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Leases) or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, in the event we undertake substantial new developments or facility renovations in the future or if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements and our debt service requirements may increase significantly.\nIf we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from future operations to meet our expected debt service obligations (including our obligations under the 5.625% Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Leases), we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on attractive terms, commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly because of our anticipated high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements expected to govern our debt.\nOur borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest, which could expose us to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates. While we may enter into interest rate hedges in the future, we currently have no such interest rate hedges. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable-rate indebtedness could increase significantly even though the amount borrowed would remain the same.\nOur indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us.\nOur Debt Agreements impose various customary negative covenants on us and our restricted subsidiaries. The restrictions that are imposed by these debt instruments include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake payments on subordinated obligations;\n\u2022\nmake dividends or distributions and repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ngrant liens on our property to secure debt;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell assets or enter into mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022\ncreate dividend and other payment restrictions affecting our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our lines of business;\n\u2022\ndesignate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nmake material amendments to the Leases.\nIn addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial tests, including interest coverage and maximum consolidated senior secured net leverage ratios. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, which events of default include the occurrence of a change of control, revocation of material licenses by gaming authorities (subject to a cure period), termination of the Leases and a cross-default to certain events of default under the Leases. The terms of the bond indenture governing the 5.625% Notes also include customary covenants and defaults for debt issuances of that nature. Our ability to comply with the covenants contained in these instruments may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control, including delay in the completion of new projects under construction. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the Debt Agreements, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default under our debt instruments, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition. If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods. This could trigger cross-defaults under our Debt Agreements. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay borrowings under our debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on any of those proposed debt instruments.\nTo service our indebtedness and make payments under the Leases, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, make payments under the Leases and fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our obligations under the Leases or pay our indebtedness, as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. In such circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, at or before maturity, and cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our expected indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners. These financing strategies may not be completed on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, certain states\u2019 laws contain restrictions on the ability of companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions. Some restrictions may prevent us from obtaining necessary capital.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms may be limited.\nAlthough we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as future cash from operations and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, will provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, we may need to seek additional financing to compete effectively. As a result of the Spin-Off and Merger with GLPI, Former Pinnacle sold substantially all of its real estate and as a result, we have less collateral with which we are able to secure financing in the future. This may result in us entering into debt financing terms that are more expensive and on less than ideal terms. Our debt ratings affect both our ability to raise debt financing and the cost of that financing. Future downgrades of our debt ratings may increase our borrowing costs and affect our ability to access the debt markets on terms and in amounts that would be satisfactory to us. If we are unable to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, it could:\n\u2022\nreduce funds available to us for purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to capitalize on business opportunities;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to economic downturns and competitive pressures in the markets in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage.\nIn the event that we undertake future development plans for capital-intensive projects, we may be required to borrow significant amounts under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, depending on which projects are pursued to completion, may cause us to incur substantial additional indebtedness.\nWe expect to fund our working capital and general corporate requirements (including our development activities) with cash flow from operations and funding from our Debt Agreements, but cannot provide assurances that such financing will provide adequate funding for our future developments. In the event that we pursue future developments and our future cash flows from operations do not match the levels we currently anticipate, whether due to downturns in the economy or otherwise, we may need to amend the terms of our credit facility or obtain waivers from our lenders in order to implement future development plans. We may not be able to obtain such an amendment or waiver from our lenders. In such event, we may need to raise funds through the capital markets and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or on terms acceptable to us.\nWe may experience an impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter (October 1st test date), or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing fair value estimates for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets because the results are based on estimated future cash flows and assumptions related thereto. Significant assumptions include estimates of future sales and expense trends, liquidity and capitalization, among other factors. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information, which we believe to be reasonable. If we are required to recognize an impairment to some portion of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe review the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. When performing this assessment, we consider current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic, legal, and regulatory factors. If we are required to recognize an impairment to some portion of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nInsufficient or lower-than-expected results generated from our new developments and acquisitions may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe cannot assure you that the revenues generated from our new developments and acquisitions, such as our acquisition of the Meadows in September 2016, will be sufficient to pay related expenses if and when these developments and acquisitions are completed, or, even if revenues are sufficient to pay expenses, that the new developments and acquisitions will yield an adequate return or any return on our significant investments. In particular, achieving the anticipated synergies of any transaction, is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether an acquired business can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner. It is possible that the integration process with respect to an acquired business could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of our ongoing business, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements. In addition, our projects, if completed, may take significantly longer than we expect to generate returns, if any. Moreover, lower-than-expected results from the opening of a new facility may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition and may make it more difficult to raise capital, even as such a shortfall would increase the need to raise capital. In addition, as new facilities on which we operate open, they may compete with the existing facilities which we own or operate.\nRising operating costs at our operations could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe operating expenses associated with our operations could increase due to, among other reasons, the following factors:\n\u2022\nchanges in the foreign, federal, state or local tax or regulations, including state gaming regulations or taxes, could impose additional restrictions or increase our operating costs;\n\u2022\naggressive marketing and promotional campaigns by our competitors for an extended period of time could force us to increase our expenditures for marketing and promotional campaigns in order to maintain our existing customer base and attract new customers;\n\u2022\nas our facilities age, we may need to increase our expenditures for repairs, maintenance, and to replace equipment necessary to operate our business in amounts greater than what we have spent historically;\n\u2022\nthe Master Lease requires us to pay variable rent and base rent, and base rent is composed of building base rent and land base rent. Every year of the Master Lease term, building base rent is subject to an annual escalation of up to 2% and may increase without a corresponding increase in revenues. Our annual variable rent is based on changes in our net revenue and as our revenues increase, our variable rent may increase without a corresponding increase in our profits;\n\u2022\nthe Meadows Lease requires us to pay percentage rent and base rent. Every year of the initial term of the Meadows Lease, our base rent is subject to an annual escalation of up to 5% with each year thereafter subject to an annual escalation of up to 2% and may increase without a corresponding increase in revenues. After the first two years of the Meadows Lease and each two years thereafter, the percentage rent is based on changes in the Meadows\u2019 average net revenue for the trailing two-lease-year period and as our Meadows\u2019 net revenues increase, our percentage rent under the Meadows Lease may increase without a corresponding increase in the Meadows\u2019 profits;\n\u2022\nan increase in the cost of health care benefits for our employees could have a negative impact on our financial results;\n\u2022\nour reliance on slot play revenues and any additional costs imposed on us from vendors;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of the many products and service we provide our customers, including food, beverages, retail items, entertainment, hotel rooms, spa and golf services;\n\u2022\navailability and costs associated with insurance;\n\u2022\nincrease in costs of labor, including due to potential unionization of our employees;\n\u2022\nour facilities use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy, and energy price increase may adversely affect our cost structure; and\n\u2022\nour facilities use significant amounts of water, and a water shortage may adversely affect our operations.\nIf our operating expenses increase without any offsetting increase in our revenues, our results of operations would suffer.\nOur slots and table games hold percentages may fluctuate.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance and our casino guests\u2019 winnings depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the element of chance, hold percentages are affected by other factors, including players\u2019 skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time played. The variability of our hold percentages have the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecessions have affected our business and financial condition, and economic conditions may continue to affect us in ways that we currently cannot accurately predict.\nEconomic recessions have had and may continue to have far reaching adverse consequences across many industries, including the gaming industry, which may have an effect on our business and financial condition. The U.S. economy experienced some weakness following a severe recession, which resulted in increased unemployment, decreased consumer spending and a decline in housing values. In addition, while the Federal Reserve took policy actions to promote market liquidity and encourage economic growth following the recession, such actions are now being curtailed as signs of improvement in the economy have emerged, and the impact of these monetary policy actions on the recovery is uncertain. Moreover, we rely on the strength of regional and local economies for the performance of each of our properties. If the national economic recovery slows or stalls, the national economy experiences another recession or any of the relevant regional or local economies suffers a downturn, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect to be engaged from time to time in one or more construction and development projects, and many factors could prevent us from completing them as planned, including the escalation of construction costs beyond increments anticipated in our construction budgets.\nConstruction of major buildings has certain inherent risks, including the risks of fire, structural collapse, human error and electrical, mechanical and plumbing malfunction. In addition, projects entail additional risks related to structural heights and the required use of cranes. Our expected development and expansion projects also entail significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nshortage of materials;\n\u2022\nshortage of skilled labor or work stoppages;\n\u2022\nunforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, excavation, environmental or geological problems;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, hurricanes, weather interference, changes in river levels, floods, fires, earthquakes or other casualty losses or delays;\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increase or delays in completing the project;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining or inability to obtain or maintain necessary license or permits;\n\u2022\nchanges to plans or specifications;\n\u2022\nperformance by contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\ndisputes with contractors;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our operations caused by diversion of management\u2019s attention to new development projects and construction at our existing facilities;\n\u2022\nremediation of environmental contamination at some of our proposed construction sites, which may prove more costly than anticipated in our construction budgets;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain and maintain necessary gaming regulatory approvals and licenses, or failure to obtain such approvals and licenses on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nrequirements or government-established \u201cgoals\u201d concerning union labor or requiring that a portion of the project expenditures be through companies controlled by specific ethnic or gender groups, goals that may not be obtainable, or may only be obtainable at additional project cost; and\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of raw materials for construction, driven by worldwide demand, higher labor and construction costs and other factors, may cause price increases beyond those anticipated in the budgets for our development projects.\nEscalating construction costs may cause us to modify the design and scope of projects from those initially contemplated or cause the budgets for those projects to be increased. We will generally carry insurance to cover certain liabilities related to construction, but not all risks are covered, and it is uncertain whether such insurance will provide sufficient payment in a timely fashion even for those risks that are insured and material to us.\nConstruction of our development projects exposes us to risks of cost overruns due to typical construction uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects. For these and other reasons, construction costs may exceed the estimated cost of completion, notwithstanding the existence of any guaranteed maximum price construction contracts.\nOur industry is highly regulated, which makes us dependent on obtaining and maintaining gaming licenses and subjects us to potentially significant fines and penalties.\nThe ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation. The statutes, rules and regulations of the states and local jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries conduct gaming operations\nrequire us to hold various licenses, registrations, permits and approvals and to obtain findings of suitability. The various regulatory authorities, including the Colorado Division of Gaming, the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission, Indiana Gaming Commission, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, the Mississippi Gaming Commission, the Missouri Gaming Commission, the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the Nevada Gaming Commission, the Ohio State Racing Commission, the Ohio Lottery Commission, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, the Pennsylvania Harness Racing Commission and the Texas Racing Commission may, among other things, limit, condition, suspend, revoke or fail to renew a license to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authorities. Substantial fines or forfeitures of assets for violations of gaming laws or regulations may be levied against us, our subsidiaries and the persons involved, including, but not limited to, our management, employees and holders of 5% or more of our securities. In addition, many of our key vendors must be licensed and found suitable by regulatory authorities and there can be no assurance that such vendors will be able to be licensed and found suitable.\nTo date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, findings of suitability, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our existing gaming facilities. It is uncertain, however, whether we will be able to obtain any new licenses, registrations, permits, approvals and findings of suitability that may be required in the future or that existing ones will be renewed or will not be suspended or revoked. Any expansion of our gaming operations in our existing jurisdictions or into new jurisdictions may require various additional licenses, findings of suitability, registrations, permits and approvals of the gaming authorities. The approval process can be time consuming and costly, and there can be no assurance of success.\nWe will also be subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations governing payment card information and the serving of alcoholic beverages at our operating facilities. If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could adversely affect our business.\nPotential changes in the regulatory environment could harm our business.\nChanges in regulations affecting the casino business can affect our operations. In addition, legislators and special-interest groups have proposed legislation from time to time that would restrict or prevent gaming operations. Other regulatory restrictions or prohibitions on our gaming operations could curtail our operations and could result in decreases in revenues.\nOur business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking.\nLegislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking in public places has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe the smoking bans and restrictions have significantly impacted business volumes.\nIn January 2015, the New Orleans City Council unanimously approved an ordinance in the City of New Orleans that prohibits smoking in casinos, bars and restaurants. The Boomtown New Orleans facility is located in the City of Harvey and not in the City of New Orleans, so the smoking ban does not apply to such facility. However, if a smoking ban was approved in the City of Harvey, we believe that this will adversely affect our business.\nIn August 2017, the East Baton Rouge Metropolitan Council approved a smoking ban in casinos and bars that will take effect in June 2018. We believe that this smoking ban will adversely affect our business at L\u2019Auberge Baton Rouge.\nOur operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel. The loss of management and other key personnel could significantly harm our business, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left our company.\nOur success and our competitive position are largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team. Although we enter into employment agreements with certain of our senior executives and key personnel, we cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain employed by us. If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel.\nWe expect to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel, including competition from numerous Native American gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation. From time to time, we expect to have a number of vacancies in key corporate and property management positions. If we are unable to successfully recruit and\nretain qualified management personnel at our facilities or at our corporate level, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our officers, directors and key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities. If the gaming authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could significantly impair our operations.\nAdverse weather conditions, road construction, gasoline shortages and other factors affecting our facilities and the areas in which we operate could make it more difficult for potential customers to travel to the facilities on which we operate and deter customers from visiting our facilities.\nOur business depends upon our ability to draw customers from each of the geographic markets in which we operate. Adverse weather conditions or road construction can deter our customers from traveling to the facilities on which we operate or make it difficult for them to frequent the facilities on which we operate. In 2015, Boomtown Bossier City and Belterra Park both experienced flooding which resulted in temporary closures at both properties, repair and clean-up costs and lost business volume. In 2016, L\u2019Auberge Lake Charles and L\u2019Auberge Baton Rouge were both negatively impacted by lost business volume due to severe rain and flooding. In 2017, visitation to Boomtown New Orleans, L\u2019Auberge Lake Charles and L\u2019Auberge Baton Rouge was negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Nate. Moreover, gasoline shortages or fuel price increases in regions that constitute a significant source of customers for the facilities on which we operate could make it more difficult for potential customers to travel to such facilities and deter customers from visiting. The dockside gaming facilities in Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri, as well as any additional riverboat or dockside casino facilities that might be developed or acquired, are also subject to risks, in addition to those associated with land-based casinos, which could disrupt our operations. Although none of the vessels on which we operate leave their moorings in normal operations, there are risks associated with the movement or mooring of vessels on waterways, including risks of casualty due to river turbulence, flooding, collisions with other vessels and severe weather conditions.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, or other catastrophic events, including war and terrorism.\nNatural disasters, such as major hurricanes, typhoons, floods, fires and earthquakes, could adversely affect our business and operating results. Hurricanes are common in the areas in which our Louisiana operations are located, and the severity of such natural disasters is unpredictable. The facilities where we operate in St. Louis (River City and Ameristar St. Charles) are located near an earthquake fault line and are subject to earthquakes. In addition, the River City casino is in an area along the Mississippi River that has historically experienced flooding. Although its foundation is built up to be above historical flooding levels, there is no certainty that this will be sufficient in future floods.\nFor example, in 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused significant damage in the Gulf Coast region. Hurricane Katrina destroyed Former Pinnacle\u2019s former Biloxi, Mississippi facility. In August 2005, the Boomtown New Orleans casino on which we operate was forced to close for 34 days as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In 2015, Boomtown Bossier City and Belterra Park both experienced flooding, which resulted in temporary closures at both properties. In 2016, L\u2019Auberge Lake Charles and L\u2019Auberge Baton Rouge were both negatively impacted by lost business volume due to severe rain and flooding. In 2017, visitation to Boomtown New Orleans, L\u2019Auberge Lake Charles and L\u2019Auberge Baton Rouge was negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Nate.\nCatastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks in the United States and elsewhere, have had a negative effect on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming (in some jurisdictions) and tourism. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or choose to purchase any insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist acts and any losses that could result from these acts. If there is a prolonged disruption at our facilities due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to a variety of natural disasters such as named windstorms, floods and earthquakes and this can make it challenging for us to obtain adequate levels of weather catastrophe occurrence insurance coverage for our facilities at reasonable rates, if at all.\nBecause of significant historical loss experience and the potential for future similar losses caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters, adequate insurance may be limited or may be cost prohibitive. Therefore, our policy contains sub-limits specifically for weather catastrophe occurrences. Our coverage for a named windstorm, flood, earthquake or act of terrorism is $200 million per occurrence, subject to a deductible, including business interruption. For other catastrophes, our coverage is $700 million per occurrence, subject to a deductible, including business interruption. In addition, as a result of the worldwide economic conditions, there may be uncertainty as to the viability of certain insurance companies and their ability to pay a claim. While we believe that the insurance companies will remain solvent, there is no certainty that this will be the case in the event of a loss.\nWe may incur property and other losses that are not adequately covered by insurance, which may harm our results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain insurance that our management believes is customary and appropriate for our business, we cannot assure you that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all losses and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. The lack of adequate insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are uninsured or underinsured. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to find replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. The Leases require us, in the event of a casualty event, to rebuild a leased property to substantially the same condition as existed immediately before such casualty event. We renew our insurance policies (other than our builder\u2019s risk insurance) on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so material that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.\nThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on us.\nA substantial majority of our revenues is attributable to slot machines operated by us at our casinos. It is important that, for competitive reasons, we offer the most popular and up-to-date slot machine games with the latest technology to our guests.\nIn recent years, the prices of new slot machines with additional features have escalated faster than the general rate of inflation. Furthermore, in recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participation lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participation lease is substantially more expensive over the long-term than the cost to purchase a new machine.\nFor competitive reasons, we may choose to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participation lease costs, it could hurt our profitability.\nWe materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations. Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.\nWe operate in a highly taxed industry and it may be subject to higher taxes in the future. If the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn gaming jurisdictions in which we operate, state and local governments raise considerable revenues from taxes based on casino revenues and operations. We also pay property taxes, admission taxes, occupancy taxes, sales and use taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and income taxes. Our profitability depends on generating enough revenues to pay gaming taxes and other largely variable expenses, such as payroll and marketing, as well as largely fixed expenses, such as property taxes and interest expense. From time to time, state and local governments have increased gaming taxes and such increases can significantly impact the profitability of gaming operations. For example, on October 30, 2017, Pennsylvania increased gaming taxes, which will adversely impact the Meadows.\nWe cannot assure you that governments in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the federal government, will not enact legislation that increases gaming tax rates. Global economic pressures have reduced the revenues of state governments from traditional tax sources, which may cause state legislatures or the federal government to be more inclined to increase gaming tax rates.\nWork stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits.\nWe are a party to certain collective bargaining agreements, including one collective bargaining agreement at Belterra Park, one collective bargaining agreement at Ameristar East Chicago and four collective bargaining agreements at the Meadows. In addition, other unions have approached our employees. A lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino facilities or future construction projects could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more aggressive union activity in the future.\nWe face environmental and archaeological regulation of the real estate on which we operate.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental statutes and regulations relating to activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water and use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials and concentrated animal feeding operations. These laws and regulations are complex, and subject to change, and failure to comply with such laws could result in the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on our operations by government agencies or courts of law or the incurrence of significant costs for the remediation of spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Under certain of these laws and regulations, and under our contractual arrangements with GLPI, including the Leases, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination on its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time that they occurred. We endeavor to maintain compliance with environmental laws, but from time to time, current or historical operations on, or adjacent to, our property may have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. A material fine or penalty, severe operational or development restriction, or imposition of material remediation costs could adversely affect our business. In addition, the locations of our current or future developments may coincide with sites containing archaeologically significant artifacts, such as Native American remains and artifacts. Federal, state and local governmental regulations relating to the protection of such sites may require us to modify, delay or cancel construction projects at significant cost to us.\nWe are subject to litigation, which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.\nFrom time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes. Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and other regulations.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to businesses generally, The Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S. Treasury Department, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the guest by name and social security number, to the IRS. This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements and to verify sources of funds, in response to which we have implemented Know Your Customer processes. Periodic audits by the IRS and our internal audit department assess compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. In recent years the U.S. Treasury Department has increased its focus on Bank Secrecy Act compliance throughout the gaming industry, and public comments by FinCEN suggest that casinos should obtain information on each customer\u2019s sources of income. This could impact our ability to attract and retain casino guests.\nThe riverboats on which we operate must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations with respect to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel and safety. In addition, we are required to have third parties periodically\ninspect and certify all of our casino barges for stability and single compartment flooding integrity. The casino barges on which we operate also must meet local fire safety standards. We would incur additional costs if any of the gaming facilities on which we operate were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, construction, land use, employment, marketing and advertising and the production, sale and service of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe imposition of a substantial penalty could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets.\nThere is a growing political and scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions, also referred to herein as \u201cGHG\u201d continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. Climate change, including the impact of global warming, creates physical and financial risk. Physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. Climate change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We have described the risks to us associated with extreme weather events in the risk factors above.\nWe may become subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. Concerned parties, such as legislators and regulators, stockholders and nongovernmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. Many states have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce GHG emissions and in the past federal legislation have been proposed in Congress. If such legislation is enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. Unless and until legislation is enacted and its terms are known, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. Further, regulation of GHG emissions may limit our guests\u2019 ability to travel to our facilities as a result of increased fuel costs or restrictions on transport related emissions.\nWe face business and regulatory risks associated with our investment in ACDL.\nPNK Development 18, LLC, one of our wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiaries, owns a minority interest in Asian Coast Development (Canada) Ltd., a British Columbia corporation (\u201cACDL\u201d). Entities affiliated with Harbinger Capital Partners (\u201cHarbinger\u201d) are the majority shareholders of ACDL. ACDL\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Ho Tram Project Company Limited (\u201cHTP\u201d) is the owner and developer of the Ho Tram Strip beachfront complex of destination integrated resorts, residential developments and golf course in the Province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau in southern Vietnam (the \u201cHo Tram Strip\u201d). As a minority shareholder of ACDL, our ability to control the management, record keeping, operations and decision-making of ACDL is limited. We fully impaired the value of our investment in ACDL in the first quarter 2013.\nHTP\u2019s operations are subject to the significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive uncertainties and contingencies frequently encountered by new businesses in new gaming jurisdictions and other risks associated with this investment, many of which are beyond ACDL\u2019s, HTP\u2019s or our control. The gaming elements of the businesses are subject to regulation by the government of Vietnam and uncertainty exists as to how such regulation will affect HTP\u2019s gaming operations. Because ACDL and HTP have limited operating history, it may be more difficult for them to prepare for and respond to these types of risks than for a company with an established business and operating cash flow.\nACDL has operations outside the United States, which expose us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing business in Vietnam. We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties. The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice in recent years have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA.\nInternal control policies and procedures and the compliance program that ACDL has implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting its employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. If ACDL\u2019s or our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing ACDL\u2019s international operations, we and our subsidiaries may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal and regulatory proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions which could, in\nturn, serve as the basis for the initiation of like proceedings by gaming regulators in one or more of the states wherein we and our subsidiaries hold gaming licenses. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and on the gaming licenses and approvals held by us and our subsidiaries.\nCompliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to ACDL\u2019s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. ACDL will also deal with significant amounts of cash in its operations and will be subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by ACDL could have a negative effect on us.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulations that impose restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our securities.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulations that relate to our current or future gaming operations and that impose certain restriction on the ownership and transfer of our securities.\nIn addition, we may be required by gaming authority to redeem shares of our common stock in the event that a stockholder is deemed to be unsuitable by a gaming regulatory authority. Our certificate of incorporation requires that if a person owns or controls our securities, including shares of our common stock, and is determined by a gaming authority to be unsuitable to own or control such securities or in the sole discretion of our Board of Directors is deemed likely to jeopardize our right to conduct gaming activities in any of the jurisdictions in which we conduct or intend to conduct gaming activities, we may redeem, and we may be required by a gaming authority to redeem, such person\u2019s securities to the extent required by the government gaming authority or deemed necessary or advisable by us.\nIf a gaming authority requires us, or if we deem it necessary or advisable, to redeem such securities, we will serve notice on the holder who holds securities subject to redemption and will call for the redemption of the securities of such holder at a redemption price equal to that required to be paid by the gaming authority making the finding of unsuitability, or if such gaming authority does not require a certain price per share to be paid, a sum deemed reasonable by us, which in our discretion may be the original purchase price, the then current trading price of the securities or another price we determine. Unless the gaming authority requires otherwise, the redemption price will in no event exceed:\n\u2022\nthe closing sales price of the securities on the national securities exchange on which such shares are then listed on the date the notice of redemption is delivered to the person who has been determined to be unsuitable, or\n\u2022\nif such shares are not then listed for trading on any national securities exchange, then the closing sales price of such shares as quoted in NASDAQ National Market System, or\n\u2022\nif the shares are not then so quoted, then the mean between the representative bid and the ask price as quoted by NASDAQ or another generally recognized reporting system.\nThe redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not so required, as we elect. Any promissory note shall contain such terms and conditions as our Board of Directors determines necessary or advisable to comply with any applicable law or regulation or to prevent a default under any of our Debt Agreements. Subject to the foregoing, the principal amount of the promissory note together with any unpaid interest shall be due and payable no later than the tenth anniversary of delivery of the note and interest on the unpaid principal thereof shall be payable annually in arrears at the rate of 2% per annum.\nBeginning on the date that a gaming authority serves notice of a determination of unsuitability or the loss or threatened loss of a gaming license upon us, and until the securities owned or controlled by the unsuitable person are owned or controlled by persons found by such gaming authority to be suitable to own them, it is unlawful for the unsuitable person or any affiliate of such person (i) to receive any dividend, payment, distribution or interest with regard to the securities, (ii) to exercise, directly or indirectly or through any proxy, trustee, or nominee, any voting or other right conferred by such securities, and such securities shall not for any purposes be included in our securities entitled to vote, or (iii) to receive any remuneration in any form from the corporation or an affiliated company for services rendered or otherwise.\nFrom and after the date of redemption, such securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of the person who was determined to be unsuitable, other than the right to receive the redemption price, will cease. Such person must surrender the certificates for any securities to be redeemed in accordance with the requirements of the redemption notice.\nAll persons owning or controlling securities of the Company and any affiliated companies must comply with all requirements of the gaming laws in each gaming jurisdiction in which we or any of our affiliated companies conduct or intend to conduct gaming activities. All securities of the Company must be held subject to the requirements of such gaming laws, including any requirement that (i) the holder file applications for gaming licenses with, or provide information to, applicable gaming authorities, or (ii) that any transfer of such securities may be subject to prior approval by gaming authorities, and any transfer of our securities in violation of any such approval requirement are not permitted and the purported transfer is void ab initio.\nOwnership and transfer of our securities could be subjected at any time to additional or more restrictive regulations, including regulation in applicable jurisdictions where there are no current restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our securities or in new jurisdictions where we may conduct our operations in the future. A detailed description of such regulations, including the requirements under gaming laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, can be found in Exhibit 99.1, \u201cGovernment Regulation and Gaming Issues,\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, and you may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all.\nMany factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall, including:\n\u2022\nmarket expectations regarding the Proposed Company Sale, including the timing and likelihood of the completion of the Proposed Company Sale and fluctuations in the market price of Penn National\u2019s common stock;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nchange in market valuations of companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nchange in expectations of future financial performance;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022\nissuance of common stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022\nissuance of common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u2022\nthe addition or departure of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments, dispositions, joint ventures or other significant business decisions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to companies\u2019 operating performance. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following the announcement of transactions such as the Proposed Company Sale or following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholder derivative lawsuits and/or securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \u201cAct\u201d) provides certain \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions for forward-looking statements.
