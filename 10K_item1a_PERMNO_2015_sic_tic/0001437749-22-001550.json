Risk Factors\nAs a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the most significant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStrategic and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and will continue to affect our operations and financial results.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which became a global pandemic. Throughout fiscal year 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant disruptive impact on global economies, supply chains and industrial production. We have effectively managed our global operations throughout the pandemic, implementing rigorous protocols focused on the health and safety of our employees and ensuring business continuity across our supplier, manufacturing and distribution networks. These actions enabled us to meet our customers\u2019 increased demands for adhesive solutions, effectively allocate our resources and manage expenses, and deliver strong financial results, while maintaining a safe workplace for employees. Concerns remain that there could be a prolonged resurgence of cases triggering additional government mandated lockdowns or similar restrictions, for example due to the emergence of new variants against which existing vaccines are not as effective or which may be more easily transmitted.\nDue to the evolving and highly uncertain nature of the pandemic, it is currently not possible to estimate any additional direct or indirect impacts this outbreak may have on our business. Any disruption of the manufacturing of our products, commerce and related activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including ongoing labor shortages and supply chain constraints, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials have adversely affected, and could continue to erode, our profit margins, and could negatively impact our operating results.\nIn 2021, raw material costs made up approximately 75 percent of our cost of sales. Based on 2021 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $13.2 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Accordingly, changes in the cost of raw materials, due to scarcity, supplier disruptions, inflation and for other reasons, can significantly impact our earnings. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum and natural gas based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate and re-test and may require seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on raw material prices, which could continue in the future. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it have significantly limited or prevented the movement of goods and services worldwide, which has resulted in and could continue to result in disruptions in our supply chain and our difficulty in procuring or inability to procure raw materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it has increased and could continue to increase the costs of making and distributing our products or result in delays in delivering, or an inability to deliver, them to our customers.\nWe experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which we operate.\nOur wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets, each of which is highly competitive. Our competitive position in markets is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multinational companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While we have an extensive customer base, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that we would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.\nFailure to develop new products and protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our future performance and growth.\nOngoing innovation and product development are important factors in our competitiveness. Failure to create new products and generate new ideas could negatively impact our ability to grow and deliver strong financial results. We continually apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents to protect the results of our research for use in our operations and licensing. We are party to a number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. We rely on patents, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth.\nA failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business, for example by leading to plant downtime and/or power outages, and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense.\nInformation technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology systems could be breached by unauthorized outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders intent on extracting sensitive information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access and a failure to effectively recover from breaches could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of assets including trade secrets and other intellectual property, customer confidence and business, result in regulatory proceedings and legal claims, and have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system that we refer to as Project ONE, which will upgrade and standardize our information system. Implementation of Project ONE began in our North America adhesives business in 2014 and, through 2021, we completed implementation of this system in various parts of our business including Latin America (except Brazil), Australia and various other businesses in North America and EIMEA. During 2022 and beyond, we will continue implementation in North America, EIMEA and Asia Pacific.\nAny delays or other failure to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of business. Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project.\nRisks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us and the inability to execute organizational restructuring may affect our results.\nAs part of our growth strategy, from time to time, we have made acquisitions of complementary businesses or products. The ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy also involves other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions, and difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and systems. Future acquisitions could result in additional debt and other liabilities, and increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expense related to intangible assets.\nIn addition, our profitability is dependent on our ability to drive sustainable productivity improvements such as cost savings through organizational restructuring. Delays or unexpected costs may prevent us from realizing the full operational and financial benefits of such restructuring initiatives and may potentially disrupt our operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations is complicated by our substantial global footprint, which will require significant and additional resources to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various countries where we conduct business.\nOur global operations expose us to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the FCPA and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the OFAC. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money-laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws, regulations, policies or procedures could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we have implemented policies and procedures in these areas, we cannot assure that our policies and procedures are sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, manufacturers, suppliers and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct in violation of such policies and procedures.\nCosts and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on us or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations can be significant and may increase as applicable requirements and their enforcement become more stringent and new rules are implemented. Adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current environmental matters.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding. Such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may increase operational costs. The impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations and may adversely affect raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products.\nWe have lawsuits and claims against us with uncertain outcomes.\nOur operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current litigation.\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of the adoption of new tax legislation and other factors.\nA change in tax laws is one of many factors that impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. The U.S. Congress and other government agencies in jurisdictions where the Company does business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company does business could change, and any such changes could adversely impact our effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\"), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These proposals, if finalized and adopted by the associated countries, will likely increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.\nThe current U.S. presidential administration could enact changes in tax laws that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. Prior to the U.S. presidential election, President Biden proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the creation of a 10% penalty on certain imports and a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income. Additionally, the proposed changes include significant provisions related to the deductibility of interest. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact to the Company\u2019s effective tax rate.\nAdditional income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Adverse developments in an audit, examination or litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction\u2019s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.\nFinancial Risks\nWe may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or long-lived assets.\nWeak demand may cause underutilization of our manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur current indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity or restrict our activities.\nOur current indebtedness contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u25cf\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and\n\u25cf\nsubject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our indebtedness.\nThe interest rates of our term loans are priced using a spread over LIBOR.\nLIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a reference rate or index in our term loans such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to a term loan extended to us is calculated using LIBOR. Most of our term loan agreements contain a stated minimum value for LIBOR.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the entity that calculates LIBOR, announced that LIBOR should be phased out by the end of 2021. Subsequently, on March 5, 2021, LIBOR\u2019s administrator announced that publication of overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month U.S. dollar LIBOR would cease immediately following publication of such interest rates on June 30, 2023, and that publication of all other currency and tenor variants would cease immediately following publication on December 31, 2021.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions and other market participants, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (\u201cSOFR\u201d). Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which can be an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). The SOFR rate is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR rates and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions.\nIf LIBOR ceases to exist prior to the maturity of our contracts, we will be required to substitute an index such as the Prime Rate or renegotiate our credit agreements that utilize LIBOR as the reference rate, and substitute an index to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. If we borrow under the Prime Rate, we will see increased borrowing costs until the agreements are amended or renegotiated to incorporate the new SOFR borrowing rate or another substitute index.\nMacroeconomicRisks\nUncertainties in foreign economic, political, regulatory and social conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results.\nApproximately 57 percent, or $1.9 billion, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2021. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in economic, political, regulatory, and social conditions, especially in Brazil, Russia, China, the Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, and other developing or emerging markets where we do business. An economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product demand often depends on end-use markets. Economic conditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce product demand. Challenging economic conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, trade protection measures, anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in legal and regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in net revenue, cost of raw materials and earnings and may adversely affect the value of our assets outside the United States. In 2021, the change in foreign currencies positively impacted our net revenue by approximately $64.0 million. In 2021, we spent approximately $1.8 billion for raw materials worldwide of which approximately $996.7 million was purchased outside the United States. Based on 2021 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $9.4 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Although we utilize risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect revenue, expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated.\nDistressed financial markets may result in dramatic deflation of financial asset valuations and a general disruption in capital markets.\nAdverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets could have a negative impact on the value of our pension trust assets, our future estimated pension liabilities and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we could be required to provide increased pension plan funding. As a result, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Reduced access to capital markets may affect our ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions. In addition, the reduced credit availability could limit our customers\u2019 ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, or meet their ongoing working capital needs. If these customers do not have sufficient access to the financial markets, demand for our products may decline.\nCatastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial results.\nUnexpected events, including global pandemics, natural disasters and severe weather events, fires or explosions at our facilities or those of our suppliers, acts of war or terrorism, supply disruptions or breaches of security of our information technology systems could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers.", "PERMNO": 37875, "SIC": 2891, "TIC": "FUL"}
