Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including those described below.\nWe May Not Be Able To Obtain the Financing We Need To Implement Our Asset Development Programs\nBased upon our current and anticipated usage of cash resources, we do not have sufficient funds to meet our expected working capital needs through the end of 2016. We will continue to require additional working capital to meet our cash resource needs until such time as our asset development programs produce revenues. If we cannot raise funds if and when needed, we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company. We cannot assure you that our current lenders, or any other lenders, will give us additional credit should we seek it. If we are unable to obtain additional credit, we may engage in further financings. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on the status of our asset development programs and general conditions in the capital markets at the time funding is sought. Any further equity or convertible debt financings would result in the dilution of ownership interests of our current stockholders.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, has included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, indicating that our current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to improve our liquidity position, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOur Development Activities Have Not Generated Significant Revenues\nAt present, our development activities include water resource and agricultural development at our San Bernardino County properties. We have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date and we do not know when, if ever, we will receive operating revenues sufficient to offset the costs of our development activities. As a result, we continue to incur a net loss from operations.\nWe May Never Generate Significant Revenues or Become Profitable Unless We Are Able to Successfully Implement Programs to Develop Our Land Assets and Related Water Resources\nWe do not know the terms, if any, upon which we may be able to proceed with our water and other development programs. Regardless of the form of our water development programs, the circumstances under which supplies or storage of water can be developed and the profitability of any supply or storage project are subject to significant uncertainties, including the risk of variable water supplies and changing water allocation priorities. Additional risks include our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and permits, litigation by environmental or other groups, unforeseen technical difficulties, general market conditions for water supplies, and the time needed to generate significant operating revenues from such programs after operations commence.\nThe Development of Our Properties Is Heavily Regulated, Requires Governmental Approvals and Permits That Could Be Denied, and May Have Competing Governmental Interests and Objectives\nIn developing our land assets and related water resources, we are subject to local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, resource protection, environmental impacts, infrastructure design, subdivision of land, construction and similar matters. Our development activities are subject to the risk of adverse interpretations or changes to U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies. Further, our development activities require governmental approvals and permits. If such permits were to be denied or granted subject to unfavorable conditions or restrictions, our ability to successfully implement our development programs would be adversely impacted.\nIn this regard, federal government appropriations currently direct the U.S. Department of the Interior (the \u201cDOI\u201d) to confirm that the Water Project\u2019s proposed use of a portion of the railroad right-of-way leased from the ARZC for the Project\u2019s conveyance pipeline is within the scope of the original right-of-way grant. According to existing federal law and direction from the DOI in Memorandum Opinion M-23075, a railroad has the authority to grant third party uses of its right-of-ways without BLM permitting if those uses will further, in part, a railroad purpose. The Project and pipeline will further numerous railroad purposes by providing fire suppression, hydropower generation creating additional rail transloading opportunities, fiber optic communications, increased traffic, access to water for business operations, and other benefits. The Company and the ARZC provided information regarding these purposes to the BLM over several years and in January 2015 in a final submission. In October 2015, the outgoing Director of the BLM\u2019s California State Office notified the Company and the ARZC that, in spite of the railroad purposes furthered by the Project pipeline, he had determined that the Project\u2019s pipeline is outside the scope of the ARZC right-of-way because the benefits derive from a pipeline that is not an original railroad purpose. The October 2015 guidance noted it was not a final determination and could be reconsidered with the presentation of additional information and in the public interest.\nThe letter also stated that if the Project would like to move ahead with the construction of a pipeline within the ARZC right-of-way, then the Company would need to file a new right-of-way application with the BLM. However, federal government appropriations currently preclude BLM spending on the review of \u201cany proposal to store water for the purpose of export or for any activities associated with the approval of rights-of-way on lands managed by the Needles Field Office of the BLM. As a result, any application to the BLM for the pipeline would need to be limited to the Project\u2019s Phase I, which is focused on the conveyance of water for municipal use and not groundwater storage, a Phase II activity.\nThe Company believes that the guidance issued by the outgoing Director of the BLM\u2019s California Office was contrary to current law and policy and should be rescinded. However, if the BLM will not change this guidance, then the Company will need to file a right-of-way permit application with the BLM for a review of the pipeline\u2019s use in Phase I and/or seek to clarify a railroad\u2019s property rights in U.S. Federal Court. Both alternatives will likely result in a delay of final Project implementation and we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of either process.\nFinally, the statutes, regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge proposed plans and approvals. Opposition from third parties will cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely. In California, third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project, which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project. We expect to be party to various legal proceedings arising in the general course of our business related to the development of the Water Project. We are currently named as a real-party-in-interest in lawsuits before the California Court of Appeals, 4th District (\u201cAppeals Court\u201d). These lawsuits seek to overturn the rulings issued by Orange County Superior Court in October 2014 which upheld all of the Water Project approvals granted to date and denied all claims against the Project. The Appeals Court has scheduled oral argument in these cases for late March 2016. While we have worked with representatives of various environmental and third party interests and agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects, certain groups may remain opposed to our development plans and pursue legal action.\nOur Failure to Make Timely Payments of Principal and Interest on Our Indebtedness May Result in a Foreclosure on Our Assets\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total indebtedness outstanding to our lenders of approximately $115.6 million. Approximately $51.8 million of our indebtedness is secured by our assets and is due in September 2017 (see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d). To the extent that we do not make principal and interest payments on the indebtedness when due at maturity, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of agreements governing our indebtedness, we may default on our obligations.\nThe Conversion of Our Outstanding Convertible Notes into Common Stock Would Dilute the Percentage of Our Common Stock Held by Current Stockholders\nIn connection with our March 2013 debt refinance (see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), we issued approximately $53.5 million in convertible notes, under which principal and accrued interest can be converted into common stock at $8.05 per share at the election of our noteholders prior to maturity in March 2018 (the \u201c2018 Convertible Notes\u201d). In December 2015, certain of the noteholders exchanged their 2018 Convertible Notes for new convertible notes under which principal and accrued interest can be converted into common stock at $6.75 per share at the election of the noteholders prior to a maturity date in March 2020 (the \u201c2020 Convertible Notes\u201d). A total of $49.025 million in original principal amount of the 2018 Convertible Notes were exchanged for 2020 Convertible Notes, leaving $3.294 million in original principal amount of the 2018 Convertible Notes outstanding. An election by our lenders to convert all or a portion of principal and accrued interest under the 2018 and 2020 Convertible Notes into common stock will dilute the percentage of our common stock held by current stockholders up to 9.5 million shares as of March 5, 2016, and up to an additional 3.0 million shares if held to maturity.\nThe Issuance of Equity Securities Under Management Equity Incentive Plans Will Impact Earnings\nOur compensation programs for management emphasize long-term incentives, primarily through the issuance of equity securities and options to purchase equity securities. It is expected that plans involving the issuance of shares, options, or both will be submitted from time to time to our stockholders for approval. In the event that any such plans are approved and implemented, the issuance of shares and options under such plans may result in the dilution of the ownership interest of other stockholders and will, under currently applicable accounting rules, result in a charge to earnings based on the value of our common stock at the time of issue and the fair value of options at the time of their award. The expense would be recorded over the vesting period of each stock and option grant.\nThe Volatility of Our Stock Price Could Adversely Affect Current and Future Stockholders\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and fluctuates in response to various factors which are beyond our control. Such fluctuations are particularly common in companies such as ours, which have not generated significant revenues. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially:\n\u00b7\ndevelopments involving the execution of our business plan;\n\u00b7\ndisclosure of any adverse results in litigation;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments affecting our ability to develop our properties;\n\u00b7\nthe dilutive effect or perceived dilutive effect of additional debt or equity financings;\n\u00b7\nperceptions in the marketplace of our company and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock markets, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Price volatility could be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.", "PERMNO": 85570, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "CDZI"}
