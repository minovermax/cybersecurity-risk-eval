{"cik": "1042418", "company": "Inhibitor Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Before purchasing our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as all other information contained in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are a pre-revenue pharmaceutical development company and, in addition to ongoing litigations that are impeding our ability to progress our business, we are subject to the risks associated with early stage businesses in that industry.\nWe are a pharmaceutical development company with no history of revenue-generating operations. Therefore, we are, and expect for the foreseeable future to be, subject to all the risks and uncertainties inherent in an early stage pharmaceutical development company. In particular, we are presently a party to litigations (see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below) which have impeded our ability to raise capital and required us to conduct only minimal operations during 2020.\nAccordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the ongoing nature of such litigations as well as even if the litigations are resolved), the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their pre-revenue generating stages, particularly those in the pharmaceutical field. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a company with no operating history will face. In particular, potential investors should consider that there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:\n\u2022\nresolve our outstanding litigations in a manner favorable to us on a timely basis or at all;\n\u2022\nimplement or execute our current business plan, or that our business plan is sound;\n\u2022\nmaintain our management team or board of directors (including, without limitation, as a result of Mayne Pharma\u2019s position as our controlling stockholder and its resultant rights to remove and replace our directors);\n\u2022\nraise sufficient funds in the capital markets or otherwise to effectuate our business plan;\n\u2022\ndetermine that the processes and technologies that we have developed are commercially viable; and/or\n\u2022\nattract, enter into or maintain contracts with potential commercial partners such as licensors of technology and suppliers.\nIf we cannot execute any one of the foregoing, our business may fail, in which case you may lose the entire amount of your investment in our company.\nIn addition, we have in the past and expect that we may in the future encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We will need to transition at some point from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be able to reach such point of transition or make such a transition, which would have a material adverse effect on our company.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult for you to evaluate our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nCurrently, our primary line of business is the development and potential marketing of our itraconazole anti-cancer therapies. We acquired the assets related to this business opportunity on August 13, 2013 as part of our emergence from bankruptcy. Our pre-bankruptcy historic business operations ceased contemporaneously with our becoming subject to bankruptcy proceedings in 2011, and all assets supporting our earlier lines of business have been disposed of. Accordingly, we only recommenced active operations on August 13, 2013, the date we emerged from bankruptcy.\nOur operations are presently limited to planning and conducting of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials, arranging for the raising of capital, developing our technology or seeking technology licenses or acquisitions, and identifying potential commercial partners. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third-party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future viability or ability to accomplish our business goals may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nWe are highly dependent on our collaboration with our majority stockholder Mayne Pharma, and the loss of this collaboration would materially impair our business plan and viability.\nUnder our Third Amended SLA with Mayne Pharma, we have secured rights to commercialize oral SUBA-Itraconazole capsules for the treatment of patients with certain cancers and non-cancerous proliferation disorders in the United States. Mayne Pharma is our sole source supplier of SUBA-Itraconazole, and under such agreement, we must obtain all required supply of SUBA-Itraconazole capsules for our clinical trials and commercialization of the product from Mayne Pharma, except in the limited circumstance where Mayne Pharma has established a secondary supplier and is unable to supply the product.\nAlso, our ability to achieve any royalty revenue from future sales by Mayne Pharma of SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS is dependent on Mayne Pharma\u2019s ability to complete clinical testing of and receive FDA approval for SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS, and thereafter to successfully generate sales of SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS, none of which may ever occur. In addition, Mayne Pharma is presently our majority stockholder, and as such has the power to exert significant control over our company.\nAs such, our agreement and collaboration with Mayne Pharma are critical to our business. In the event that the Third Amended SLA is terminated, we may lose the ability to commercialize SUBA-Itraconazole, and our business prospects and overall viability as a company would be materially damaged.\nMayne Pharma is our majority stockholder and has, and may in the future, exert significant influence over our business and affairs. Moreover, the corporate governance rights afforded to Mayne Pharma under the Equity Holders Agreement may adversely affect the management of our company.\nAs of the date of this Report, Mayne Pharma beneficially owns approximately 59.2% of our outstanding voting securities (including shares of our common stock and shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d)). Under the terms of our Amended and Restated Equity Holders Agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Amended and Restated Equity Holders Agreement (the \u201cEquity Holders Agreement\u201d), Mayne Pharma has the right to designate one director to our Board of Directors (and to designate a second director if the size of the Board of Directors is increased to seven directors) until the earlier to occur of: (i) the date that the Third Amended SLA is terminated or expires, or (ii) the date on which Mayne Pharma along with its affiliates ceases to own ten percent (10%) or more of our issued and outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. During this time frame, Mayne Pharma, through its representative on the Board of Directors, holds a veto right in the event that we want to increase or decrease the size of the Board of Directors or replace or remove our President and Chief Executive Officer (such veto right being the result of each of the foregoing Board of Director actions requiring the unanimous consent of the Board of Directors).\nMayne Pharma\u2019s significant ownership of our voting securities plus the existence of these additional rights will for the foreseeable future enable Mayne Pharma to exert significant influence over our company and matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors (although required under our Equity Holders Agreement to maintain a majority of independent directors until a single shareholder owns greater than 90% of our common stock), financing activities or a merger or sale of our assets. An example of Mayne Pharma\u2019s exercise of its stockholder rights occurred in November 2016, when Mayne Pharma acted by written consent to remove two sitting members of our Board of Directors and replace such directors with appointees of Mayne Pharma\u2019s choosing. Mayne Pharma may elect in its discretion to exercise these or similar rights at any time. Additionally, these rights may limit the ability of our Board of Directors and our management team to make necessary personnel decisions, including adding independent directors to our Board of Directors, which may adversely affect the management of our company, particularly if disputes arise between us and Mayne Pharma (which disputes in and of themselves could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business).\nThe right of Mayne Pharma to participate in future financings of ours could impair our ability to raise capital.\nPursuant to our agreements with Mayne Pharma, Mayne Pharma and its affiliates have been granted certain rights to purchase a pro rata share of any new securities issued by us, which pro rata share would be determined based upon the number of shares of our common stock held by Mayne Pharma and its affiliates on a fully diluted basis as compared to the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the offering of the new securities on a fully diluted basis. The existence of such right of participation, or the exercise of such rights, may deter potential investors from providing us needed financing, or may deter investment banks from working with us, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our company.\nWe may be unable to acquire or license additional technologies to expand our product development pipeline.\nThe growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire or in-license additional proprietary technologies related to pharmaceutical therapies. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive practice and companies that may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their larger size and cash resources or greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete such negotiations and ultimately acquire or license the rights to additional product candidates that we may seek to acquire.\nAdditionally, as in the case with our option agreement with UConn, we sometimes collaborate with academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically (as with UConn), these institutions provide companies like ours with an option to negotiate a license to institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a full license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue the applicable program.\nAll of foregoing could lead to our lack of an evolved product development pipeline, which would leave us at continued risk of dependence on SUBA-Itraconazole and our relationship with Mayne Pharma and would decrease our ability to grow into a viable pharmaceutical development company.\nWe are dependent upon our officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a very small group of individuals and, in particular, our current officers and directors, including most notably Nicholas J. Virca. We believe that our ability to implement our business plans depends on the continued service of these individuals and/or other officers and directors. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or officers could have a detrimental effect on us.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities (including activities previously undertaken in a private company context) more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our business plans. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from business development activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current and any future partners, contractors, and consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. This is particularly true in the case of collecting and analyzing clinical data, which is a key component of our business. System failures, accidents, or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our commercialization activities, development programs and our business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data from future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the commercialization of any potential product candidate could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need For Additional Capital\nWe have very little cash resources and will require substantial additional funding to progress our business. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts and our business could fail.\nAs of the date of this Report, we only have cash on hand and availability under the our December term loan arrangement with Mayne Pharma sufficient to run our planned operations into the quarter ending December 31, 2021. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect that we will be required to incur significant expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we engage in efforts to develop and ultimately commercialize SUBA-Itraconazole or other therapeutic candidates.\nAccordingly, we will need to obtain long term additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts, and our business might fail or become bankrupt.\nIn addition, our future capital requirements will be significant and will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our development efforts for SUBA-Itraconazole Prostate;\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our pre-clinical development efforts with product candidates other than SUBA-Itraconazole Prostate;\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of Mayne Pharma\u2019s efforts effort to commercialize SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS for which we will receive a quarterly cash royalty of 9% of net sales if such sales are achieved;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\ncompeting technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our product candidates as a treatment;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of our potential future acquisitions or licenses of additional pharmaceutical technologies;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any product candidate for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe revenue, if any, received from commercial sales or licensing royalty from a commercial partner of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other products and technologies; and\n\u2022\nlegal, accounting, insurance and other professional and business-related costs.\nDeveloping, acquiring or licensing pharmaceutical products, conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval of such products is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidate, if approved (of which no assurances may be given), may not achieve any level of commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of a product that we do not expect to be commercially available for at least one year, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe have no cash generating operations, are presently having difficulty in raising capital and may consume resources faster than expected.\nWe currently do not generate any revenue from product sales, royalties, or otherwise, and we therefore have a limited source of cash to meet our future capital requirements. We do not expect to generate revenues or receive royalty revenue for the foreseeable future, and we may not be able to raise funds in the future due to the nature of our company or other factors (some of which are beyond our control), and our inability to raise funds would leave us without resources to continue operations and force us to resort to stockholder investments or loans, which may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. For example, an action purportedly brought directly and derivatively on behalf of our company by a stockholder of our company (which we refer to here as the \u201cAction\u201d see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below) has impeded our ability to raise capital given that the outcome of the litigation is uncertain. The existence of the Action and the uncertainty surrounding its outcome may continue to impede our ability to raise funding for so long as the outcome of the Action is uncertain.\nAdditionally, we may have difficulty raising needed capital in the near or longer term as a result of, among other factors, the clinical stage nature of our business, Mayne Pharma\u2019s status as our majority stockholder, the rights of Mayne Pharma and HPLLC to participate in our future financings and our lack of revenues as well as the inherent business risks associated with our company and present and future market conditions. Also, we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding sooner than anticipated. Our inability to raise funds could lead to decreases in the price of our common stock and the failure of our business.\nRaising additional capital or issuing new securities in connection with strategic transactions may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nSince we will be unable to generate any revenue from actual sales of products and expect to be in the development stage for the foreseeable future (other than royalties on future sales of SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS in the U.S. assuming FDA approval), we will need to seek equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to execute our business plan. We will need significant funding for developing, acquiring or licensing our intellectual property, conducting clinical trials and entering into collaborations with third-party partners as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital on acceptable terms, or at all (particularly while the Action is pending). If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected to a significant extent.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the percentage and/or economic ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may also issue equity securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.\nDebt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on our assets, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, increases in our expenses and requirements that our assets be provided as a security for such debt. Debt financing would also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidate, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nFunding from any source may be unavailable to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient capital to fund our operations and expenses, our business could fail or become subject to bankruptcy.\nMoreover, we may issue equity securities in connection with potential strategic transactions such as acquisitions or licenses of other companies or technologies. Such issuances could be in significant amounts and would also cause dilution to our stockholders and grant the recipients of such securities varying amounts of control over our company and our business.\nRisks Related to the Clinical Development of Our Product Candidate\nWe are early in our development efforts. Assuming we are able to raise new funding, if we are unable to clinically develop and ultimately commercialize SUBA-Itraconazole or other product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe are early in our development efforts as of the date of this Report. We have the exclusive U.S. rights to develop SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment of cancer and non-cancerous proliferation disorders in the licensed field, and while itraconazole has previously been approved by the FDA for use as an anti-fungal agent, the use of itraconazole to treat cancer and non-cancerous proliferation disorders has not been approved and has been subject to limited clinical testing by others and by us in our previous Phase 2b clinical trial with SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS.\nTherefore, our ability to generate product or royalty revenues, which we do not expect will occur for several years, if ever, will depend heavily on our ability to develop and eventually commercialize our product candidate. The positive development of our product candidate will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to raise funds to progress our business, of which no assurances can be given;\n\u2022\npositive commencement and completion of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nsuccessful preparation of regulatory filings and receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and potential regulatory exclusivity for our product candidate and protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nmaintaining our agreement with Mayne Pharma to produce product needed for clinical testing and, potentially if approvals are obtained, for commercial sale;\n\u2022\nlaunching commercial sales of our product, if and when approved for one or more indications, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nacceptance of the product for one or more indications, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nprotection from generic substitution based upon our own or licensed intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\neffectively competing with other therapies;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement from healthcare payors; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our product following approval, if any.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to clinically develop and commercialize SUBA-Itraconazole as a therapy for cancer and non-cancerous proliferation disorders, which would materially harm our business.\nIn addition, given our current limited financial resources, we are currently focusing our efforts on one key cancer indication, namely prostate cancer. We are thus faced with the risk that SUBA-Itraconazole could be ineffective in addressing this particular cancer indication, and if our efforts to demonstrate the efficacy of SUBA-Itraconazole in prostate cancer are not positive, we may lack the resources to expand our efforts into other cancer indications.\nIf we are unable to convince physicians as to the benefits of SUBA-Itraconazole as a therapy for cancer and non-cancerous proliferation disorders, if and when it is approved, we may incur delays or additional expense in our attempt to establish market acceptance.\nUse of SUBA-Itraconazole as a cancer therapy and a therapy for non-cancerous proliferation disorders will require physicians to be informed regarding the intended benefits of the product for a new indication. The time and cost of such an educational process may be substantial. Inability to carry out this physician education process may adversely affect market acceptance of SUBA-Itraconazole as a therapy for cancer and non-cancerous proliferation disorders. We may be unable to timely educate physicians in sufficient numbers regarding our intended application of SUBA-Itraconazole to achieve our marketing plans or to achieve product acceptance. Any delay in physician education or acceptance may materially delay or reduce demand for our product candidate. In addition, we may expend significant funds toward physician education before any acceptance or demand for SUBA-Itraconazole as a therapy for cancer and non-cancerous proliferation disorders is created, if at all.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidate.\nThe risk of failure for product candidates in clinical development is high. It is impossible to predict when our sole product candidate, SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment of cancer and certain non-cancer proliferation disorders, will prove effective and safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval for the treatment of any disease, the indication for which is licensed to us. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of SUBA-Itraconazole as a cancer therapy, we must conduct one or more clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidate in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Moreover, the outcome of early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success\nof later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidate, including:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product candidate may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs, which would be time consuming and costly;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nwe may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidate may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u2022\nour product candidate may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials; and\n\u2022\ninteractions with other drugs.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidate beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidate for one or more indications;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all for one or more indications;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired (particularly, in our case, for different types of cancer);\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know which, if any, of our clinical trials will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the right to commercialize our product candidate or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidate and may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in any future clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue future clinical trials for our present or future product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. In addition, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat the same indications as our product candidate, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our future clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates.\nPatient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u2022\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u2022\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any future clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidate, which would cause the value of our company to decline and otherwise materially and adversely affect our company.\nIf serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidate, we may need to abandon or limit such development, which would adversely affect our company.\nIf clinical testing of our product candidates results in undesirable side effects or demonstrates characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon such development or limit such development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in early stage testing for treating cancer have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect to expend our limited resources primarily to pursue a particular product candidate, leaving us unable to capitalize on other product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of clinical and commercial development.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we will focus for the foreseeable future primarily on the clinical development of SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment of prostate cancer. As a result, we may forego or be unable to pursue opportunities with other product candidates or for indications other than those we intend to pursue that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on research and development programs related to SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment of cancer may not yield any commercially viable therapies. Because of this concentration of our efforts, our business will be particularly subject to significant risk of failure of our one current product candidate.\nWe expect to rely on collaborations with third parties for key aspects of our business. If we are unable to secure or maintain any of these collaborations, or if these collaborations do not achieve their goals, including most notably our collaboration with Mayne Pharma, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe presently have very limited capabilities for drug development and do not yet have any capability for manufacturing, sales, marketing or distribution. Accordingly, we expect to enter into collaborations with other companies that we believe can provide such capabilities. These collaborations may also provide us with important funding for our development programs. One such collaboration was entered into in September 2013 with Mayne Pharma for SUBA-Itraconazole under an exclusive supply and license agreement, most recently amended in December 2018.\nThere is a risk that we may not be able to maintain our current collaboration or to enter into additional collaborations on acceptable terms or at all, which would leave us unable to progress our business plan. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to maintain or reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of our product candidate, reduce or delay its development program, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense.\nMoreover, even if we are able to maintain and/or enter into such collaborations, such collaborations may pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidate, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to such product candidate, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop or be associated with products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidate;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to our arrangements with them;\n\u2022\nshould our product candidate achieve regulatory approval, a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to our product candidate may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and we do not have the right to sue infringers of the rights granted to us by Mayne Pharma under the Third Amended SLA; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to either find alternative collaborators (which we may be unable to do) or raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of our product candidate on our own.\nOur business could be materially harmed if any of the foregoing or similar risks comes to pass with respect to our key collaborations.\nWe have contracted with Mayne Pharma and may contract with other third parties, for the manufacture of our product candidates for clinical testing and expect to continue to do so for commercialization. This reliance on third parties, and in particular Mayne Pharma, increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidate(s) or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not have any manufacturing capabilities, nor do we have the right to manufacture or have SUBA-Itraconazole manufactured except under agreement with Mayne Pharma. We will rely on Mayne Pharma for the manufacture of our product candidate, SUBA-Itraconazole, for clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidate ultimately receives marketing approval. This reliance on Mayne Pharma leaves us exposed to the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidate or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. In addition, the possibility of a business interruption event with Mayne Pharma or any other manufacturer may occur, such as bankruptcy, factory contamination or natural disaster, which may result in the inability to obtain product, which would cause our business prospects to be adversely impacted.\nMoreover, we may be unable to maintain our agreement with Mayne Pharma or establish any agreements with other third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms should we have the ability and the need to do so. Even though we have established an agreement with Mayne Pharma or if we are able to establish agreements with other third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third-party;\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third-party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidate or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidate or products.\nIn addition, our product candidate and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nAlso, any performance failure on the part of Mayne Pharma could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for bulk drug substance. If Mayne Pharma cannot perform as agreed, we may not be able to continue developing SUBA-Itraconazole.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nEven if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval for any indication, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment of cancer and non-cancerous proliferation disorders (or other product candidates we may acquire or license) receives marketing approval for any indication, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. For example, current cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation therapy are well established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments. If our product candidate does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment of cancer and non-cancerous proliferation disorders, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nour ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nthe convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects; and\n\u2022\nany restrictions on the use of our product together with other medications.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidate if and when it is approved.\nWe currently do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure. To achieve any level of commercial success for any product for which we have obtained marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales and marketing organization or outsource sales and marketing functions to third parties.\nThere are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nIf approved, factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product on our own include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our product;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are unable to or choose not to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and instead enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services, our product revenues and our profitability, if any, are likely to be lower than if we were to market, sell and distribute any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may be unable to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our product candidate or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our product effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidate, which would have a material adverse effect on our company.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidate and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of cancer. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs, and we may be unable to effectively compete with these companies for these or other reasons.\nEven if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals.\nOur ability to commercialize any product candidate also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product candidate will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we commercialize and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. Reimbursement may affect the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our products may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn addition, there may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement\nlevels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidate in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot defend ourselves against claims that our product candidate or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nreduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently do not have product liability insurance coverage, which leaves us exposed to any product-related liabilities that we may incur. We may be unable to obtain insurance on reasonable terms or at all. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products (particularly itraconazole, and the formulation of SUBA-Itraconazole in particular, as an anti-cancer therapy), or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur business plan depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States with respect to our proprietary technology and products, and in particular, the rights to develop SUBA-Itraconazole as a therapy for cancer and non-cancerous proliferation disorders. We seek to protect our proprietary position through our exclusive license for SUBA-Itraconazole with Mayne Pharma, through our sublicense of other itraconazole-related rights from Mayne Pharma, our own patents for treating cancer with SUBA-Itraconazole and by filing patent applications in the United States related to our novel technologies and product candidate and also our expectation to license additional applicable patents from third parties. We will also need to obtain and maintain patent protection for any technologies we may acquire or license (including the UConn technology to which we currently have an option).\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances (particularly in collaboration scenarios such as our agreement\nwith Mayne Pharma), we may not have the right to control (in whole or in part) the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nSpecifically, United States Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances. From time to time, the United States Supreme Court, other federal courts, the United States Congress, or interpretation by the United States Patent and Trademark Office or USPTO, may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business. Some cases decided by the United States Supreme Court have involved questions of when claims reciting abstract ideas, laws of nature, natural phenomena and/or natural products are eligible for a patent, regardless of whether the claimed subject matter is otherwise novel and inventive. These cases include Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569 U.S. 576 (2013), also known as the Myriad decision; Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 573 U.S. 208 (2014), also known as the Alice decision; and Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., also known as the Prometheus decision, 566 U.S. 66 (2012). The full impact of these decisions is not yet known. In view of these and subsequent court decisions, the USPTO has issued materials to patent examiners providing guidance for determining the patent eligibility of claims reciting laws of nature, natural phenomena, or natural products.\nIn addition, patent reform legislation could further increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent Office has developed regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, since we have patent applications pending and plan to file for additional patents in the future, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of our product candidate, patents protecting such candidate might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our owned or licensed patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, we do not have the right to sue infringers of the rights granted to us by Mayne Pharma under the Third Amended SLA, so we will be reliant upon them to take any action necessary to protect these patents. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.\nWe have licensed or expect to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not continue to be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe have and/or expect to enter into licenses with third parties that hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development of itraconazole, and SUBA-Itraconazole in particular, as an anti-cancer therapy, and it may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties, such as Mayne Pharma, to commercialize itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy, in which case we have or would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or else our business could be harmed, possibly materially. Even though we have obtained exclusive rights to additional patents from Mayne Pharma and have had patents issued for our own inventions in the United States in November 2015, May 2018, June 2019 and July 2019, if we were not able to maintain our current license or obtain additional licenses, or were not able to maintain or obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly substantially.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business will depend upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our primary product candidate or other products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are and expect to be party to one or more license or similar agreements that may impose due diligence, development and commercialization timelines, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under current or future licenses, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which case we might not be able to develop, manufacture or market any product that is covered by these agreements (particularly SUBA-Itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy) or may face other penalties under the agreements. Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under any such agreement. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nand Other Legal and Compliance Matters\nIf we fail to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidate, and our ability to generate revenue and the viability of our company will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their clinical development and commercialization, including matters relating to design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA (including under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act) and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency (known as the EMA) and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market SUBA-Itraconazole or any other product from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction.\nSecuring marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidate may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use of our product. In particular, new cancer drugs frequently are indicated only for patient populations that have not responded to an existing therapy or have relapsed. Even if our product candidate receives marketing approval for one or more indications, of which no assurances may be given, the accompanying labels may limit the approved use of our drug, which could limit sales of the product.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals in the United States is very expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. We experienced unexpected complexities of this nature in the regulatory development of SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS (which ultimately led to Mayne Pharma to assume control of that product), and may experience similar complexities in the future, which could harm our prospects\nIn addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of our product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidate, the commercial prospects for our product candidate will be harmed and our ability to generate revenues, and the viability of our company generally, will be materially impaired.\nWe may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nAlthough we currently do not directly market or promote any products, we may also be subject to several healthcare regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal HIPAA and HITECH laws, which govern the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal healthcare programs\u2019 Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nOur regulatory strategy is reliant on the potential for approval of SUBA-Itraconazole as a treatment for various indications under an expedited FDA procedure, which may not be available to us.\nWe have in the past, are currently and it is our intention in the future to seek to avail ourselves of the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) approval procedure where it is appropriate to do so, particularly for SUBA-Itraconazole as a therapy to treat cancer and non-cancerous proliferation disorders since itraconazole has previously been approved\nfor another indication. Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act permits an applicant to file an NDA with the FDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and the FDA\u2019s findings of safety and effectiveness based on certain preclinical testing or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product.\nIf this approval pathway is not available to us with respect to our product candidate, the time and cost associated with developing and commercializing such candidate may be prohibitive and our business strategy could be materially and adversely affected.\nA fast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe have the opportunity to seek \u201cfast track\u201d designation for our product candidate for one or more indications. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation, so even if we believe that SUBA-Itraconazole may be eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it should we apply for this designation. Even if we do receive fast track designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development programs.\nWe were denied breakthrough therapy status by the FDA for our initial proposed therapy, and a breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for our product candidates, even if ultimately granted, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nA breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for accelerated approval.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that SUBA-Itraconazole meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy for one or more indications, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In fact, in January 2017, our initial breakthrough request related to SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS was denied by FDA.\nMoreover, even if such designation is granted for one or more of our proposed therapies, of which no assurances may be given, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for any product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if SUBA-Itraconazole qualifies as a breakthrough therapy for one or more indications, the FDA may later decide that it no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened, which would deny us the benefits of such designation.\nOrphan designation for our product candidates may be difficult to obtain, and if our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for their products that are the same drug or a similar medicinal product as our product candidates, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time.\nRegulatory authorities may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as \u201corphan\u201d drugs. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of market exclusivity, which, subject\nto certain exceptions, precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable market exclusivity period is seven years in the United States. We previously secured orphan drug designation for SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS (our previous product candidate).\nObtaining orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates may be important to our commercial strategy. If a competitor obtains orphan drug exclusivity for and approval of a product with the same indication as our product candidates before we do, and if the competitor\u2019s product is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as ours, we could be excluded from the market. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity after FDA approval, we may not be able to maintain it. For example, if a competitive product that is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as our product candidate is shown to be clinically superior to our product candidate, any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity will not prevent the approval of a product that is the same drug as our product candidate if the FDA finds that we cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of the persons with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. If one or more of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our company.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, we will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. In addition, even if marketing approval of our product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. New drugs frequently are indicated only for patient populations that have not responded to an existing therapy or have relapsed. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our drug in this way, which could limit sales of the products.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of our products. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we or any third-party partners of ours do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our product, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such product, our manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of the product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions of product distribution use;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe need to utilize warning letters;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n\u2022\nrefusal by regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nWe may face similar issues in connection with non-compliance with non-U.S. regulatory requirements.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nAn active trading market for our common stock does not exist and may not develop or be sustained.\nAn investment in our company will likely require a long-term commitment, with no certainty of return. Although our common stock is listed for quotation on the OTCQB marketplace operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc., trading has been very limited, and we cannot predict whether an active market for our common stock will ever develop in the future. In the absence of an active trading market:\n\u2022\ninvestors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations;\n\u2022\nmarket visibility for shares of our common stock may be limited; and\n\u2022\na lack of visibility for shares of our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for shares of our common stock.\nThe OTCQB market is a relatively unorganized, inter-dealer, over-the-counter market that provides significantly less liquidity than NASDAQ or the NYSE American (formerly known as the American Stock Exchange). This illiquid trading market for our common stock may make it difficult for you to dispose of your common stock at desirable prices or at all. Moreover, there is a risk that our common stock could be delisted from the OTCQB, in which case it might be quoted on the OTC Pink Market, which is even more illiquid than the OTCQB.\nThe lack of an active market impairs your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire additional intellectual property assets by using our shares as consideration.\nMoreover, while we may seek to have our common stock listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, there is a risk that we will be unable to do so, which would leave our common stock listed on the OTCQB and subject to the foregoing risks of illiquidity.\nWe may not maintain qualification for OTCQB inclusion, and therefore you may be unable to sell your shares.\nOur common stock is eligible for quotation on the OTCQB. However, trading of our common stock could be suspended. If for any reason our common stock does not become eligible or maintain eligibility for quotation on the OTCQB or a public trading market does not develop, purchasers of shares of our common stock may have difficulty selling their shares should they desire to do so. If we are unable to satisfy the requirements for quotation on the OTCQB, any quotation in our common stock could be conducted on the OTC Pink Market, which is an unorganized and often illiquid market. As a result, a purchaser of our common stock may find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of their shares. This would materially and adversely affect the liquidity of our securities.\nEven if a market for our common stock develops, the market price of our common stock may be significantly volatile, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers.\nThe market price for our common stock may be significantly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial or operational estimates or projections;\n\u2022\nconditions in markets generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic performance or market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic or political conditions in the United States or elsewhere.\nIn particular, the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nchanges in our relationship with Mayne Pharma\n\u2022\nany delay in or the results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe announcements of clinical trial data, and the investment community\u2019s perception of and reaction to those data;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials conducted by others on products that would compete with our product candidate;\n\u2022\nany litigation in which the Company is a party, including the Action;\n\u2022\nany delay or failure to receive NDA acceptance and approval by FDA and other regulatory agencies or bodies;\n\u2022\nour inability to commercially launch our product or market and generate sales of our product;\n\u2022\nfailure of our product, even if approved for marketing, to achieve any level of commercial success;\n\u2022\nour failure to obtain or maintain patent protection for any of our technologies and product or the issuance of third-party patents that cover our technologies or product;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our product\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nour competitors\u2019 technological innovations;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our expenditures;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents;\n\u2022\nfailure to adequately manufacture our product through third parties for purposes of clinical trials or actual sales;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and\n\u2022\nlow trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, if we fail to reach an important research, development or commercialization milestone or result by a publicly expected deadline, even if by only a small margin, there could be significant impact on the market price of our common stock. Additionally, as we approach the announcement of anticipated significant information and as we announce such information, we expect the price of our common stock to be particularly volatile, and negative results would have a substantial negative impact on the price of our common stock.\nIn some cases, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our business operations and reputation.\nOur management and two significant stockholders collectively own a substantial majority of our common stock and voting power.\nCollectively, our officers, our directors and two significant stockholders (HPLLC and Mayne Pharma) own or exercise voting and investment control of approximately 80.1% of our common stock as of the date of this Report. As a result, investors may be prevented from affecting matters involving our company, including:\n\u2022\nthe composition of our Board of Directors and, through it, any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers;\n\u2022\nany determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations;\n\u2022\nour acquisition or disposition of assets; and\n\u2022\nour corporate financing activities.\nFurthermore, this concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in a company that is controlled by a small number of stockholders.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise funds in future securities offerings.\nSignificant blocks of our stock are held by HPLLC and Mayne Pharma, and these entities also hold warrants to purchase our common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the then prevailing market price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for us to raise funds in the future through a public offering of our securities.\nOur Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held by Mayne Pharma ranks senior to our common stock in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of our assets.\nAs of the date of this Report, Mayne Pharma, our majority stockholder, owns 5,797,102 shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, which we issued in connection with two tranches of our financing with Mayne Pharma which closed in January 2018 and July 2018. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up, our assets will be available to pay obligations on our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in preference to the holders of our common stock. There is therefore a risk that in such a case, our common stockholders may see no return on their investment if our assets can only satisfy our obligations to Mayne Pharma as the holder of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.\nOur common stock is considered a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d and thereby is subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell.\nOur common stock is considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as it does not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Section 3a51-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our common stock will be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d for so long as it meets one or more of the following conditions: (i) the stock trades at a price less than $5 per share; (ii) it is not traded on a \u201crecognized\u201d national exchange; or (iii) is issued by a company (such as ours) that has been in business less than three years with net tangible assets less than $5 million.\nThe principal result or effect of being designated a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock will be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations set forth in Rules 15g-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor\u2019s account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to: (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock, which could depress the price of our shares.\nFINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price.\nYou may face significant restrictions on the resale of your shares due to state \u201cblue sky\u201d laws.\nEach state has its own securities laws, often called \u201cblue sky\u201d laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state\u2019s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must also be registered in that state.\nWe do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. We have not yet applied to have our securities registered in any state and will not do so until we receive expressions of interest from investors resident in specific states after they have viewed this Report. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. You should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited, as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification.\nThere may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud may materially harm our company.\nProper systems of internal controls over financial accounting and disclosure are critical to the operation of a public company. Given the size of our company and the limited number of fulltime employees that we have employed, there may be certain limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls. Moreover, we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud, if any. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially and adversely impact us.\nBecause we became public by means other than a traditional initial public offering, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.\nOur business was created when certain operating assets were contributed to our company in August 2013 as our company was a \u201cshell company\u201d emerging from bankruptcy. Since our current business became a public company by means other than a traditional initial public offering, investors and securities analysts may be reluctant to invest in or provide research coverage of us. This stigma could impair our fundraising opportunities and our reputation generally.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by industry or financial analysts. If no or few analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, among other matters:\n\u2022\npermit our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate;\n\u2022\nprovide that all vacancies on our Board of Directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide advance notice in writing, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice; and\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election;\nThe financial and operational projections that we may make from time to time are subject to inherent risks.\nThe projections that our management may provide from time to time (including, but not limited to, those relating to potential peak sales amounts, product approval, production and supply dates, commercial launch dates, and other financial or operational matters) reflect numerous assumptions made by management, including assumptions with respect to our specific as well as general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there is a risk that the assumptions made in preparing the projections, or the projections themselves, will prove inaccurate. There will be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially different from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of the projections in this Report should not be regarded as an indication that we or our management or representatives considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not invest in our common stock in the expectation that you will receive dividends.", "PERMNO": 85457, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "INTI"}
