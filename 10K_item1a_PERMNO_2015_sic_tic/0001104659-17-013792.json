RISK FACTORS\nAny investment in our Class A Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this Form 10-K before purchasing our Class A Common Stock. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business and our Class A Common Stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If any of the events described\nbelow occur, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The market price of our Class A Common Stock could decline due to any of these risks, perhaps significantly, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nA lack of credit and/or limited financing availability to the Company, its vendors, dealers, or end users could adversely affect our business.\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if, under its current bank credit agreement, the Company\u2019s ability to borrow money from its existing lenders to finance its operations is reduced or eliminated. Similar adverse effects may also result if the Company realizes lessened credit availability from trade creditors. Additionally, many of our customers require the availability of financing to facilitate the purchase of our products. As a result, a continuing period of reduced credit availability in the marketplace could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nIncreases in the price and demand for raw materials could lower our margins and profitability.\nSupreme generally does not have long-term raw material contracts and is dependent upon suppliers of steel, aluminum, wood products, and fiberglass materials, among others, for its manufacturing operations. Consequently, our ability to produce and deliver our products could be affected by disruptions encountered by our raw material suppliers or freight carriers. Additionally, competitive market conditions may prevent the Company from implementing price increases to offset raw material cost increases. As a result the Company\u2019s gross margin could be adversely affected.\nVolatility in the supply of vehicle chassis and other vehicle components could adversely affect our business.\nWith the exception of some specialty vehicle products, the Company generally does not purchase vehicle chassis for its inventory. The Company accepts shipments of vehicle chassis owned by dealers or end-users for the purpose of installing and/or manufacturing its specialized truck bodies on such chassis. Historically, General Motors Corp. (\u201cGM\u201d) and Ford Motor Company (\u201cFord\u201d) have been the primary suppliers of chassis. In the event of a disruption in supply from one major supplier, the Company would attempt to use another major supplier, but there can be no assurance that this attempt would be successful. Nevertheless, in the event of chassis supply disruptions, there could be unforeseen consequences that may have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business operations.\nThe Company also faces risk relative to finance and storage charges for maintaining an excess supply of consigned chassis from GM and Ford. Under the consigned chassis agreements, if a chassis is not delivered to a customer within a specified time frame, the Company is required to pay finance or storage charges on such chassis.\nWe compete in the highly competitive specialized vehicle industry which may impact our financial results.\nThe competitive nature of the specialized vehicle industry creates a number of challenges for the Company. Important factors include product pricing, quality of product, lead times, geographic proximity to customers, and the ability to manufacture a product customized to customer specifications. Specialized vehicles are produced by a number of smaller, regional companies which create product pricing pressures that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profits. Chassis manufacturers have not generally shown an interest in manufacturing specialized vehicles, including truck bodies, because such manufacturers\u2019 highly-automated assembly line operations do not lend themselves to the efficient production of a wide variety of highly-specialized vehicles with various options and equipment.\nDemand for our products can be adversely impacted by negative economic trends.\nInstability in the U.S. economy, negative conditions in the U.S. credit markets, volatility in the industries that our products serve, or adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers could lead to reduced, cancelled, or delayed orders for our products. Our fleet customers traditionally order our products on an annual basis, but the size of fleet orders may be negatively impacted by the negative economic factors listed above or the size of a fleet customer\u2019s previous order. Additionally, negative economic trends may cause our retail customers to choose not to order, cancel orders, or delay ordering, our products. Such occurrences could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe have potential exposure to environmental and health and safety liabilities which may increase costs and lower profitability.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental and health and safety statutes and regulations, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to water, treatment, storage, and disposal of waste, and remediation of contaminated sites. In certain cases, these requirements may limit the productive capacity of our operations.\nCertain laws, including the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, have imposed strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability for costs to remediate contaminated sites upon designated responsible parties including site owners or operators and persons who dispose of wastes at, or transport wastes to, such sites.\nFrom time to time, we have received notices of noncompliance with respect to our operations. These notices have typically been resolved by investigating the alleged noncompliance and correcting any non-compliant conditions. New environmental requirements, more aggressive enforcement of existing ones, or discovery of presently unknown conditions could require material expenditures or result in liabilities which could limit expansion or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating cash flows.\nA product defect claim in excess of our insurance coverage, or for which we have no insurance, or an inability to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates, could have a materially adverse effect upon our business.\nWe face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability, product recall, and other product defect related claims, if the use of our current or formerly manufactured products result, or are alleged to result, in personal injury and/or property damage, or if a significant number of our products must be recalled, or if a product defect results in the Company having to refund the purchase price of a substantial number of vehicles. If we manufacture a defective product, we may experience material losses and we may incur significant costs to defend product defect claims. We could also incur damages and significant costs in correcting any defects, experience lost sales, and suffer damage to our reputation. We may not have insurance coverage for certain types of claims or our insurance coverage may not be adequate for liabilities we could incur and may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.\nOur manufacturer\u2019s warranties expose us to potentially significant claims.\nWe are subject to product warranty claims in the ordinary course of our business. If we manufacture poor quality products or receive defective materials, we may incur unforeseen costs in excess of what we have reserved in our financial statements. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating cash flows.\nWe depend on the services of our key executives. Any loss of our key executives could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur ability to compete successfully and implement our business strategy depends on the efforts of our senior management personnel. The loss of the services of any one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain key-man life insurance policies on any of our executives. If we were unable to attract qualified personnel to our management, our existing management resources could become strained, which may harm our business and our ability to implement our strategies.\nOur relatively low trading volumes may limit our stockholders\u2019 abilities to buy or sell their shares.\nOur Class A Common Stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volumes. Overall market conditions, and other risk factors described herein, may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to fall. Our high and low sales prices for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 were $19.83 and $5.40, respectively. Our Class A Common Stock is listed on the NYSE MKT exchange under the symbol \u201cSTS.\u201d However, daily trading volumes for our Class A Common Stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly-traded securities. For example, during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016, our daily trading volume has been as low as 1,000 shares. It may be difficult for you to buy or sell shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our Class A Common Stock may, therefore, be volatile.\nOur officers and directors own a large percentage of our common stock. They may vote their shares in ways with which you disagree.\nAs of February 21, 2017, our officers and directors as a group beneficially owned 19.3% of our Class A Common Stock and 95.8% of our Class B Common Stock. As a result, they will continue to be able to exercise significant influence, and in most cases, control, over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our charter documents, and significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our Class A Common Stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business.\nOur split classes of stock may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire the Company which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur outstanding common stock is split into two classes. The Class A Common Stock is listed on the NYSE MKT exchange, and the holders thereof are entitled to elect three members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. The majority (95.8%) of the Class B Common Stock is owned or controlled by the Company\u2019s officers and directors and is entitled to elect the remaining seven members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. The continuing ability of the holders of our Class B Common Stock to elect a majority of the members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors will make it difficult for another company to acquire us and for Class A stockholders to receive any related take-over premium (unless the controlling group approves the sale).\nOur internal controls provide only reasonable assurance that objectives are met. Failure of one or more of these controls could adversely affect the Company.\nWhile the Company believes that its control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The Company continues to take action to comply with the internal controls, disclosure controls, and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe may not have the ability to sell idle facilities.\nWe currently own facilities which have been idle for a period of time and are currently being marketed for sale (see Item 2. \u201cProperties\u201d). Although management has exercised its best judgment to reflect accurate current market values of these properties in the Company\u2019s financial statements, there cannot be any assurance that these properties can be sold for these values anytime in the near future.\n(See other risk factors listed in Item 7 under the caption: \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d).", "PERMNO": 63159, "SIC": 3713, "TIC": "STS"}
