{"cik": "1039828", "company": "AMERICAN EQUITY INVESTMENT LIFE HOLDING CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAny or each of the events described below may (or may continue to) adversely affect our reputation, our regulatory, customer, or other relationships, our business, our net income and results of operations, our expenses, our profitability, our liquidity or cash flows, our statutory capital position, our book value and book value per share, our ability to meet our obligations, our credit and financial strength ratings, our risk-based capital ratios, our financial condition, our cost of capital, or the market price of our common stock. The effects may vary widely from time to time, product to product, market to market, region to region, or segment to segment. Many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of any of them may cause others to emerge or worsen. Such combinations could materially increase the severity of the cumulative or separate impact of these risks.\nThese risk factors are not a complete set of all potential risks that could affect us. You should carefully consider the risk factors together with other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cBusiness,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d as well as in other reports and materials we submit to the SEC.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Economic Conditions\n1. Our results may differ from our management assumptions, estimates, and models.\nOur financial results are based on assumptions and estimates that depend on many factors, none of which are certain. Our actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. As a result, our decisions on products and pricing, calculation of account balances within our financial statements, and the amounts of regulatory and rating agency capital we expect to need to hold may be wrong. Our estimates are based on complex analysis and interpretation of large quantities of data, involve sophisticated judgment and expertise, and are imprecise. We may change our assumptions and estimates from time to time as a result of engaging more sophisticated methods, obtaining additional information, or due to discovery of errors. Our expected pricing expenses and benefits are based on assumptions about how long a policy will remain in force and about mortality and longevity. Our actual experience may differ from our pricing assumptions. We may have to change our actuarial estimates, accelerate amortization of deferred acquisition expenses, increase our policy benefit reserves, or pay higher benefits than we projected. For example, persistency lower than our assumptions may require us to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy.\nCertain financial statement balances depend on estimates and assumptions including the calculations of policyholder benefit reserves, derivatives and embedded derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements, the fair value of investments and valuation allowances. The calculations we use to estimate these balances are complex. We make significant assumptions such as expected index credits, the age when a policyholder may begin to utilize the lifetime income benefit rider, the number of policyholders that may not utilize the lifetime income benefit rider, expected policyholder behavior including expected lapse rates, discount rates and the expected cost of annual call options, any of which may change over time and may be inaccurate. We use judgement in making estimates and assumptions, and our accuracy depends on multiple factors, including market conditions, interest rates, credit conditions, spreads, liquidity, and observable market data. Our investment returns or cash flows may also differ from our expectations.\nIn addition, our risk management policies, procedures, and models may be imperfect or may not be sufficiently comprehensive. As a result, they may not identify or adequately protect us from every risk to which we are exposed.\n2. Interest rate conditions could change.\nInterest rate increases or decreases could harm our investment spread, or the difference between yields on our invested assets and our cost of money, the fair value of our investments and the reported value of stockholders' equity and the unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolio.\nSustained low interest rates may harm our ability to offer attractive rates and benefits to customers while maintaining profitability. This may reduce our fixed index annuity sales, as consumers seek potentially higher returns. Rising interest rates may lead customers to surrender their policies, increasing our net cash outflows, requiring us to sell assets at a disadvantaged price and accelerating our amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements. Our sales may decline during such times, or we may increase annuity crediting rates but be unable to generate the investment returns or spreads we desire.\n3. Our investments may lose value or fail to grow as quickly as we expect due to market, credit, liquidity, concentration, default, and other risks.\nOur investments and their performance, including our derivative financial instruments, are subject to credit defaults, market value volatility and changes to credit spreads. The impact of these items can be exacerbated by financial and credit market volatility. We may fail to adjust to market conditions, producing investment portfolio losses. Our portfolio diversification management by asset class, creditor, industry, and other limitations may be inadequate.\nWe may have to sell investments that are not publicly traded or that otherwise lack liquidity (such as privately placed fixed maturity securities, below investment grade securities, investments in mortgage loans and alternative investments) below fair market values and could incur losses. We may be unable to liquidate positions quickly to meet unexpected policyholder withdrawal obligations.\nOur mortgage loans may fail to perform and borrowers may default on their obligations. Declining debt service coverage ratios and increasing loan to value ratios, poor loan performance, borrower or tenant financial difficulties, catastrophes, and other events may harm mortgage carrying values, which could lead to investment losses.\nDerivatives margin requirements may increase, and we may be required to post collateral. In addition, our costs may increase due to counterparties' higher capital requirements for derivatives. We may need to liquidate higher yielding assets for cash to cover some or all of these costs.\n4. Our option costs could increase.\nOur cost of call options, which we use to manage the index-based risk component of our fixed index annuities, may increase due to higher equity market volatility, higher interest rates, or other market factors. We may be unable to effectively mitigate this risk by adjusting caps, participation rates, and asset fees on policy anniversary dates to reflect these increases.\n5. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk.\nWe have counterparty credit risk with other insurance companies through reinsurance. Our efforts to mitigate these risks, such as by securing assets in trusts and requiring the reinsurer to establish a letter of credit or deposit securities in the trusts for any shortfall, may be inadequate to protect us. Where the annuity deposits we ceded are unsecured, our claims would be subordinated to those of the reinsurer's policyholders. Should our reinsurers fail to meet their obligations to us, we remain liable for the ceded policy liabilities. If we were forced to recapture reinsured business, we may have inadequate capital to do so.\nWe may be unable to use reinsurance to the extent and on the terms we want. As a result, we would have to accept an increase in our net liability exposure or a decrease in our statutory surplus, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop other alternatives.\nOur call options counterparties may fail to perform. Our efforts to maintain quality and credit exposure concentration limits may be inadequate to mitigate this risk.\nCounterparties' failure to perform their derivative instrument obligations may impose costs on us to fund index credits on our fixed index annuities. We may be unable to enforce our counterparties' obligations to post collateral to secure their obligations to us.\n6. The third parties on whom we rely for services may fail to perform or to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.\nThe third parties who perform various services for us, including sales agents, marketing organizations, investment managers, and information technologists, may fail to meet our performance expectations. Our controls to monitor their service levels and compliance with our rules and legal and regulatory standards may be inadequate.\n7. Our competitors have greater resources, a broader array of products, and higher ratings, which may limit our ability to attract and retain customers or distributors.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully with larger companies who enjoy larger financial resources, broader and more diversified product lines, higher ratings, and more widespread agency relationships. Customers may choose fixed index, fixed rate, or variable annuities sold by other insurance companies, or chose mutual fund products, traditional bank products, and other retirement funding alternatives offered by asset managers, banks and broker/dealers. Competitors' products may have competitive or other advantages based on design, participation\nrates and crediting rates, policy terms and conditions, services provided to distributors and policyholders, ratings by rating agencies, reputation and distributor compensation.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully for product distribution sources (such as IMOs, other marketers, agents, broker/dealers, banks and registered investment advisors) based on innovative and timely products, financial strength, services provided to and the relationships developed with distributors, or competitive commission structures and timely payments. Our distributors may choose to sell others' products, and are generally free to do so.\n8. Our information technology and communication systems may fail or suffer a security breach.\nWe may lose access to or use of our information technology (IT) systems to accurately perform necessary business functions such as issuing new policies, providing customer support, maintaining existing policies, paying claims, managing our investment portfolios, and producing financial statements. Our efforts, policies, and processes to avoid or mitigate systems failures, fraud, cyberattacks, processing errors, and regulatory breaches may fail or prove inadequate.\nWe may be unable to keep the confidential information within our IT infrastructure secure or maintain adherence to privacy standards or expectations. Our complex information security controls framework that leverages multiple leading industry control standards, as well as extensive commercial control technologies we use to maintain the security of those systems, is imperfect and may fail. An attacker who circumvents our comprehensive information security controls infrastructure could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete information contained within the accessed systems, including personally identifiable policyholder information and proprietary business information.\nOur efforts and expenses to maintain and enhance our existing systems to keep pace with changing security requirements, industry standards, and evolving customer preferences may be insufficient or misguided, impairing our ability to rely on information for product design, product pricing, and risk management decisions. Our extensive backup and recovery systems and contingency plans may not prevent system interruptions, failures, or allow us to promptly remediate those that do occur.\n9. We may suffer a credit or financial strength downgrade.\nWe may fail to maintain or improve our financial strength or credit ratings, whether due to the results of operations of our subsidiaries or our financial condition.\nA ratings downgrade, or the potential for a ratings downgrade, could cause distributors and sales agents to stop or reduce our product sales in favor of our competitors, could increase our policy or contract surrenders, and harm our ability to obtain reinsurance or to do so at competitive prices.\n10. We may be unable to raise additional capital to support our business and sustain our growth on favorable terms.\nWe may need to increase or maintain the statutory capital and surplus of our life insurance subsidiaries, or the capital of our holding company, through debt, equity, and/or other transactions. We may be unable to do so because of adverse market conditions or high cost of capital, or be able to do so only on unfavorable terms. As a result, we may have to limit sales of new annuity products. We may also agree to restrictions on other activities, transactions, or financial arrangements in order to obtain necessary capital.\n11. U.S. and global capital markets and economies could deteriorate due to major public health issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic, political or social developments, or otherwise.\nEconomic and capital markets could suffer downturns, uncertainties, or market disruptions. For example, armed conflict in Europe or elsewhere, sanctions intended to address those conflicts or achieve other ends, COVID-19 and the related pandemic, and government and business efforts in reaction to any of these, may continue to create economic and financial turmoil and contribute to a recession, to decreased economic output, to unemployment, to market dislocations, to political uncertainties, to inflation, to stagnated economic growth, and other effects. These may reduce the performance, and increase the risks, of our investment portfolio. They may also prevent us from continuing normal business operations, and our measures to mitigate their effects - such as remote working and workplace safety measures - may be inadequate to limit the strain on our business continuity plans and contain operational risk, such as information technology and third-party service provider risks.\n12. We may fail to authorize and pay dividends on our preferred stock.\nWe may fail to authorize and pay dividends on our preferred stock. Unpaid dividends would not accrue, and could result in our inability to pay or declare a dividend on our common stock or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration our common stock. Any such failure would also prevent us from making certain distributions to common shareholders. They may also give preferred shareholders the right to elect members of our Board of Directors or other corporate governance rights that could weaken the rights and interests of common shareholders and other stakeholders.\n13. Our subsidiaries may be unable to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nOur future cash flows may be limited, as they depend upon the availability of dividends, surplus note interest payments and other statutorily permissible payments from our insurance subsidiaries, such as payments under our investment advisory agreements and tax allocation agreements with our subsidiaries. Without such cash flow, we may be unable to service debt we incur from time to time (including senior\nnotes, term loans, subordinated debentures issued to a subsidiary trust, and others), pay operating expenses and pay dividends to common and preferred stockholders.\n14. We may fail at reinsurance, investment management, or third-party capital arrangements.\nWe may be unable to source, negotiate, obtain timely regulatory approval for, and execute the reinsurance, investment management, or third-party-capital arrangements for our strategy to succeed. As a result, we may not realize our anticipated economic, strategic or other benefits of any such transaction and may incur unforeseen expenses or liabilities. Any reorganization or consolidation of the legal entities through which we conduct business may raise similar risks.\n15. We may fail to prevent excessive risk-taking.\nOur employees, including executives and others who manage sales, investments, products, wholesaling, underwriting, and others, may take excessive risks. Our compensation programs and practices, and our other controls, may not effectively deter excessive risk-taking or misconduct.\n16. Our policies and procedures may fail to protect us from operational risks.\nWe may make errors or fail to detect incorrect or incomplete information in any of the large number of transactions we process through our complex administrative systems. Our controls and procedures to prevent such errors may not be effective. For example, we may fail to escheat property timely and completely, or fail to detect, deter or mitigate fraud against us or our customers. We may fail to maintain service standards or to operate efficiently or control costs. In addition, we may fail to attract, motivate and retain employees, develop talent, or adequately plan for management succession. We may also suffer internal control deficiencies or disclosure control deficiencies that result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.\nRisks Relating to Legal, Regulatory, Environment, Social, or Governance Matters\n17. We may be subject to increased litigation, regulatory examinations, and tax audits.\nWe may become involved in increased litigation, including class action lawsuits, alleging improper product design, improper sales practices and similar claims. State regulatory bodies, such as state insurance departments, the SEC and the DOL may investigate our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities laws and ERISA. In addition, U.S. and state authorities have and may continue to audit our compliance with tax laws.\n18. Laws, regulations, accounting, and benchmarking standards may change.\nAny of the myriad of insurance statutes and regulations in the various states in which our life insurance subsidiaries transact business, including those related to insurance holding companies, may change at any time with or without warning. Laws affecting our investments, such as rules on enforcing mortgage rights, may change. Accounting standards such as those issued by the FASB, statutory accounting standards, or others may change, and interest rate benchmarking standards, such as LIBOR's replacements, may change, evolve, or be replaced. U.S. federal laws and rules, such as those related to securities or ERISA, may also change. In addition, those with authority or influence may change their interpretation of such laws or accounting standards, or may disagree with our interpretation of them. We may be unable to adapt to any such changes or disagreements in a timely or effective manner. Tax law changes may also harm us. For example, should individual income tax rates decrease, some of the income tax advantages of our products would likewise decrease. Moreover, tax law may change or eliminate any of the income tax advantages of our products. Further, changes to the basis of U.S. income taxation (e.g., taxation of unearned gains), corporate tax rates, capital gains tax rates, and other changes, may affect us.\n19. Iowa or other applicable law, or our corporate governance documents or change-in-control agreements, may delay or deter takeovers or combinations.\nState laws, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, and agreements into which we have entered concerning changes in control may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider favorable.\n20. Climate changes, or responses to it, may affect us.\nClimate change may increase the frequency and severity of near- or long-term weather-related disasters, public health incidents, and pandemics, and their effects may increase over time. Climate change regulation may harm the value of investments we hold or harm our counterparties, including reinsurers. Our regulators may also increasingly focus their examinations on climate-related risks.\n21. Our efforts to meet environmental, social, and governance standards and to enhance our sustainability may not meet expectations.\nOur investors or others may evaluate our business practices by continually evolving and unclear environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) criteria that may reflect contrasting or conflicting values or agendas. Our practices may also not change in the particulars or at the rate all parties expect, and may involve management trade-offs. To the extent we establish specific commitments or targets, we may fail to meet them.", "PERMNO": 89946, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "AEL"}
