{"cik": "929008", "company": "WESCO INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified by the following factors. This information should be read in conjunction with Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K.\nOperational Risks\nAdverse conditions in the global economy and disruptions of financial markets could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nOur results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our customers, which in turn is affected by global economic conditions and market factors impacting the industries and markets that they serve. Certain global economies and markets continue to experience significant uncertainty and volatility, particularly commodity-driven end markets such as oil and gas and metals and mining. Adverse economic conditions or lack of liquidity in these markets, particularly in North America, may adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Economic and financial market conditions may also affect the availability of financing for projects and for our customers' capital or other expenditures, which can result in project delays or cancellations and thus affect demand for our products. There can be no assurance that any governmental responses to economic conditions or disruptions in the financial markets ultimately will stabilize the markets or increase our customers' liquidity or the availability of credit to our customers. Should one or more of our larger customers declare bankruptcy, it could adversely affect the collectability of our accounts receivable, along with bad debt reserves and net income. In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to do so. The economic, political and financial environment may also affect our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict, and there can be no assurance that economic and political instability, both domestically and internationally (for example, resulting from changes to trade policies, tariffs or participation in trade agreements or economic and political unions) will not adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in the future.\nExpansion into new business activities, industries, product lines or geographic areas could subject the company to increased costs and risks and may not achieve the intended results.\nWe have invested significantly in expanding our e-commerce capabilities and online customer experience. If our efforts to expand our capabilities in this area are not successful, we may not realize the return on our investments as anticipated, or our operating results could be adversely affected by slower than expected sales growth or additional costs. Furthermore, engaging in or significantly expanding business activities in product sourcing, sales and services could subject the company to unexpected costs and risks. Such activities could subject us to increased operating costs, product liability, regulatory requirements and reputational risks. Our expansion into new and existing markets, including manufacturing related or regulated businesses, may present competitive distribution and regulatory challenges that differ from current ones. We may be less familiar with the target customers and may face different or additional risks, as well as increased or unexpected costs, compared to existing operations. Growth into new markets may also bring us into direct competition with companies with whom we have little or no past experience as competitors. To the extent we are reliant upon expansion into new geographic, industry and product markets for growth and do not meet the new challenges posed by such expansion, our future sales growth could be negatively impacted, our operating costs could increase, and our business operations and financial results could be negatively affected.\nAn increase in competition could decrease sales, profit margins, and earnings.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and compete directly with global, national, regional and local providers of like products and services. Some of our existing competitors have, and new market entrants may have, greater resources than us. Competition is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities and price. Other sources of competition are buying groups formed by smaller distributors to increase purchasing power and provide some cooperative marketing capability, as well as e-commerce companies. There may be new market entrants with non-traditional business and customer service models, resulting in increased competition and changing industry dynamics.\nExisting or future competitors may seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, and we may be required to lower our prices or may lose business, which could adversely affect our financial results. We may be subject to supplier price increases while not being able to increase prices to customers. Also, to the extent that we do not meet changing customer preferences or demands, or to the extent that one or more of our competitors becomes more successful with private label products, on-line offerings or otherwise, our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected. Existing or future competitors also may seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable acquisitions. These factors, in addition to competitive pressures resulting from the fragmented nature of our industry, could affect our sales, profit margins and earnings.\nCertain events or conditions, including a failure or breach of our information security systems, could lead to interruptions in our operations, which may materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe operate a number of facilities and we coordinate company activities, including information technology systems and administrative services and the like, through our headquarters operations. Our operations depend on our ability to maintain existing systems and implement new technology, which includes allocating sufficient resources to periodically upgrade our information technology systems, and to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against both manmade and natural disasters, as well as power losses, computer and telecommunications failures, technological breakdowns, unauthorized intrusions, cyber-attacks, and other events. Conversions to new information technology systems may result in cost overruns, delays or business interruptions. If our information technology systems are disrupted, become obsolete or do not adequately support our strategic, operational or compliance needs, it could result in a competitive disadvantage or adversely affect our business operations and financial condition, including our ability to process orders, receive and ship products, maintain inventories, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses, therefore impacting our results of operations.\nBecause we rely heavily on information technology both in serving our customers and in our enterprise infrastructure in order to achieve our objectives, we may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of cyber-attacks, including computer viruses, worms or other malicious software programs that access our systems. Additionally, third parties may fraudulently attempt to induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords and other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Despite the precautions we take to mitigate the risks of such events, an attack on our enterprise information technology system, or those of third parties with which we do business, could result in theft or disclosure of our proprietary or confidential information or a breach of confidential customer, supplier or employee information. Such events could have an adverse impact on revenue and harm our reputation. Additionally, such an event could cause us to incur legal liabilities and costs, which could be significant, in order to address and remediate the effects of an attack and related security concerns.\nWe also depend on accessible office facilities, distribution centers and information technology data centers for our operations to function properly. An interruption of operations at any of our distribution centers or data centers could have a material adverse effect on the operations of branches served by the affected distribution or data center. Such disaster related risks and effects are not predictable with certainty and, although they typically can be mitigated, they cannot be eliminated. We seek to mitigate our exposures to disaster events in a number of ways. For example, where feasible, we design the configuration of our facilities to reduce the consequences of disasters. We also maintain insurance for our facilities against casualties, and we evaluate our risks and develop contingency plans for dealing with them. Although we have reviewed and analyzed a broad range of risks applicable to our business, the ones that actually affect us may not be those that we have concluded are most likely to occur. Furthermore, although our reviews have led to more systematic contingency planning, our plans are in varying stages of development and execution, such that they may not be adequate at the time of occurrence for the magnitude of any particular disaster event that we may encounter.\nAcquisitions that we may undertake would involve a number of inherent risks, any of which could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result.\nWe have expanded our operations through organic growth and selected acquisitions of businesses and assets, and may seek to do so in the future. Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, including: problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business; uncertainties in assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates; the potential loss of key employees of an acquired business; the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction; unanticipated changes in business, industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition or other transaction rationale; and expansion into new countries or geographic markets where we may be less familiar with operating requirements, target customers and regulatory compliance. Any one or more of these factors could increase our costs or cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of a business or assets.\nWhile there are risks associated with acquisitions generally, including integration risks, there are additional risks more specifically associated with owning and operating businesses internationally, including those arising from import and export controls, foreign currency exchange rate changes, developments in political, regulatory or economic conditions impacting those operations and various environmental and climatic conditions in particular areas of the world.\nWe must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and the failure to do so may adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on hiring, retaining and motivating key employees, including executive, managerial, sales, technical, marketing and support personnel. We may have difficulty locating and hiring qualified personnel. In addition, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against us. The loss of key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel could disrupt or adversely affect our business, its sales and operating results. In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover, which may also result in loss of significant customer business, or increased employee benefit costs.\nLoss of key suppliers, product cost fluctuations, lack of product availability, or inefficient supply chain operations could decrease sales, profit margins, and earnings.\nMost of our agreements with suppliers are terminable by either party on 60 days' notice or less. Our 10 largest suppliers in 2019 accounted for approximately 32% of our purchases for the period. Our largest supplier in 2019 was Eaton Corporation, accounting for approximately 11% of our purchases. The loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from any of these suppliers, a supplier's change in sales strategy to rely less on distribution channels, the loss of key preferred supplier agreements, or disruptions in a key supplier's operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, effects of economic, political or financial market conditions on a supplier's operations, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments, transportation disruptions, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease, information system disruptions or other reasons beyond our control.\nIn addition, certain of our products, such as wire and conduit, are commodity price based products and may be subject to significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control. While increases in the cost of energy or products could have adverse effects, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate. Fluctuations in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect our customers. Declines in oil and natural gas prices can negatively impact our customers operating in those industries and, consequently, our sales to those customers. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that particular products or product lines will be available to us, or available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. Such limited product access could cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage. The profitability of our business is also dependent upon the efficiency of our supply chain. An inefficient or ineffective supply chain strategy or operations could increase operational costs, decrease sales, profit margins and earnings, which could adversely affect our business.\nFinancial Risks\nFluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our results from operations.\nThe results of our foreign operations are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The exchange rates between some of these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years, and may continue to do so in the future. We may incur losses related to foreign currency fluctuations, and foreign exchange controls may prevent us from repatriating cash in countries outside the U.S. In addition, because our financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars, such fluctuations may also affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nChanges in tax laws or challenges to the Company's tax positions by taxing authorities could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes in jurisdictions in which we do business, including but not limited to taxes imposed on our income, receipts, stockholders' equity, property, sales, purchases and payroll. As a result, the tax expense we incur can be adversely affected by changes in tax law. We frequently cannot anticipate these changes in tax law, which can cause unexpected volatility in our results of operations. While not limited to the United States (U.S.) and Canada, changes in the tax law at the federal and state/provincial levels in the U.S. and Canada can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, the tax laws to which the Company is subject are inherently complex and ambiguous. Therefore, we must interpret the applicable laws and make subjective judgments about the expected outcome upon challenge by the applicable taxing authorities. As a result, the impact on our results from operations of the application of enacted tax laws to our facts and circumstances is sometimes uncertain. If a tax authority successfully challenges our interpretation and application of the tax law to our facts and circumstances, there can be no assurance that we can accurately predict the outcome and the taxes ultimately owed upon effective settlement, which may differ from the tax expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss) and accrued in our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, if we cannot meet liquidity requirements in the U.S., we may have to repatriate funds from overseas, which would result in additional income taxes being incurred on the amount repatriated.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJA\") was enacted on December 22, 2017, and it significantly affected U.S. tax law by, among other things, changing how the U.S. taxes the income of multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury (the \"Treasury Department\") has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how the TCJA is applied. While the Treasury Department and various states have issued guidance to clarify certain aspects of the TCJA, this guidance may be subject to change when issued in its final form. Further, the Treasury Department and various states are expected to issue additional guidance to address other aspects of the TCJA.We will continue to monitor the guidance issued by the Treasury Department and the various states and will record any material impact related to it in the period of enactment.\nOur outstanding indebtedness requires debt service commitments that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and could limit our growth and impose restrictions on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2019, excluding debt discount and debt issuance costs, we had $1.3 billion of consolidated indebtedness. We and our subsidiaries may undertake additional borrowings in the future, subject to certain limitations contained in the debt instruments governing our indebtedness. Over the next three years, we will be required to repay or refinance approximately $942.6 million of our currently outstanding indebtedness.\nOur debt service obligations impact our ability to operate and grow our business. Our payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness reduce the amount of funds available to us to invest in operations, future business opportunities, acquisitions, and other potentially beneficial activities. Our debt service obligations also increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, financial\nmarket and industry conditions. Our ability to service and refinance our indebtedness, make scheduled payments on our operating leases and fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other business opportunities, will depend in large part on both our future performance and the availability of additional financing in the future. There can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future to service our debt, make necessary capital expenditures, or meet other cash needs. If unable to do so, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, sell assets, or obtain additional financing.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur credit facilities require us to maintain specific earnings to fixed expense ratios and to meet minimum net worth requirements in certain circumstances. In addition, our credit facilities and our other debt agreements contain, and any of our future debt agreements may contain, additional covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business, or are dependent upon our future financial performance.\nAs a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be significantly restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us. See the liquidity section in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\" for further details.\nThere is a risk that the market value of our common stock may decline.\nStock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations, and the market prices of companies in our industry have been volatile. For some issuers, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity. It is impossible to predict whether the price of our common stock will rise or fall. Trading prices of our common stock will be influenced by our operating results and prospects and by economic, political, financial, and other factors.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe are subject to costs and risks associated with global laws and regulations affecting our business, as well as litigation for product liability or other matters affecting our business.\nThe global legal and regulatory environment is complex and exposes us to compliance costs and risks, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings, which could materially affect our operations and financial results. These laws and regulations may change, sometimes significantly, as a result of political or economic events, and some changes are anticipated to occur in the coming year. They include tax laws and regulations, import and export laws and regulations, labor and employment laws and regulations, product safety, occupational safety and health laws and regulations, securities and exchange laws and regulations, data privacy laws and regulations (and other laws applicable to publicly-traded companies such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and environmental laws and regulations. Furthermore, as a government contractor selling to federal, state and local government entities, we are also subject to a wide variety of additional laws and regulations. Proposed laws and regulations in these and other areas could affect the cost of our business operations.\nFrom time to time we are involved in legal proceedings, audits or investigations which may relate to, for example, product liability, labor and employment (including wage and hour), tax, escheat, import and export compliance, government contracts, worker health and safety, and general commercial and securities matters. While we believe the outcome of any pending matter is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity, additional legal proceedings may arise in the future and the outcome of these as well as other contingencies could require us to take actions, which could adversely affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money.\nRisks Related to Our Pending Acquisition of Anixter\nCompletion of the merger is subject to the conditions contained in the merger agreement and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger will not be completed.\nOur obligations to complete the merger with Anixter are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others, the approval of the merger proposal by Anixter stockholders and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.\nMany of the conditions to the closing of the merger are not within WESCO\u2019s or Anixter\u2019s control, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to July 10, 2020, which deadline may be extended, under certain circumstances, to October 13, 2020, and which deadline may be further extended, under certain circumstances, to January 11, 2021, it is possible that the merger agreement will be terminated. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expects to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger will be completed.\nThe merger is subject to the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of approvals, consents or clearances from certain regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on the anticipated benefits of the merger or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the merger.\nBefore the merger may be completed, any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act relating to the completion of the merger must have expired or been terminated and any authorization or consent from a governmental authority required to be obtained with respect to the merger under the antitrust laws of Canada, Mexico and Turkey must have been obtained. WESCO, Anixter and Merger Sub also plan to seek approvals under the antitrust laws of Russia and Chile. The receipt of such approvals, however, is not a condition to the closing of the merger.\nThe governmental authorities from which these approvals are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations, and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the merger. These governmental authorities may initiate proceedings seeking to prevent, or otherwise seek to prevent, the merger. As a condition to the approval of the merger, these governmental authorities also may impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company\u2019s business after completion of the merger, which could adversely affect our ability to integrate Anixter\u2019s operations with our operations, reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction or otherwise materially and adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations after completion of the merger.\nUnder the merger agreement, WESCO and Anixter have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such authorizations and consents and we have agreed to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust or certain other laws that may be asserted by any governmental authority so as to enable the completion of the merger as promptly as practicable. However, we are not required to take any action that would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, a material adverse effect on WESCO, Anixter and our respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, at any time before or after completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of applicable waiting periods, the applicable U.S. or foreign antitrust authorities or any state attorney general could take such action under the antitrust laws as such party deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include, among other things, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. In addition, in some circumstances, a third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging, seeking to enjoin, or seeking to impose conditions on the merger. We may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any such action. Upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, including the termination by either party because certain required regulatory clearances either are not obtained before the outside date or are denied, WESCO would be required to pay Anixter a reverse termination fee of $190 million.\nThere can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the merger set forth in the merger agreement relating to applicable regulatory laws will be satisfied and no assurance that the merger will be completed.\nThe business relationships of WESCO and Anixter and their respective subsidiaries may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of WESCO, Anixter and, following the completion of the merger, the combined company.\nParties with which WESCO and Anixter, or their respective subsidiaries, do business may be uncertain as to the effects on them of the merger and related transactions, including with respect to current or future business relationships with WESCO, Anixter, their respective subsidiaries or the combined company. These relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we and Anixter have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or Anixter, as applicable, or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than WESCO, Anixter, their respective subsidiaries or the combined company. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of WESCO or the combined company following the completion of the merger, including an adverse effect on our ability to realize the expected synergies and other benefits of the merger. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively affect our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Anixter stockholders failing to approve the merger proposal, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, we could be subject to a number of negative consequences, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price;\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from our customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nwe will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the Anixter acquisition, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to pay a cash termination fee as required by the merger agreement, and\n\u2022\nmatters related to the Anixter acquisition (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of our time and resources, which could have resulted in our inability to pursue other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us.\nIf the merger is not completed, any of these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nCompletion of the merger will trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Anixter is a party, which may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe completion of the merger will trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which Anixter is a party. If Anixter and WESCO are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if Anixter and WESCO are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Anixter or the combined company. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe merger will involve substantial costs.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two companies. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will comprise transaction and regulatory costs related to the merger. WESCO and the combined company will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nUncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees of Anixter or WESCO, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company following the merger.\nWESCO and Anixter are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined company\u2019s success after the merger will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of both companies. Current and prospective employees of WESCO and Anixter may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger, which may materially adversely affect the ability of each party to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to retain key management personnel.\nCombining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized.\nWESCO and Anixter have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of WESCO and Anixter. It is possible that the pendency of the merger and/or the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, higher than expected costs, diversion of management attention of both WESCO and Anixter, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. As part of the integration process, we may also attempt to divest certain assets of the combined company, which may not be possible on favorable terms, or at all, or if successful, may change the\nprofile of the combined company. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Our management continues to refine its integration plan. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of WESCO and Anixter during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger. In addition, the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated.\nIn connection with the merger, WESCO will incur additional indebtedness and may also assume certain of Anixter\u2019s outstanding indebtedness, which could adversely affect WESCO, including by decreasing WESCO\u2019s business flexibility, and will increase its interest expense.\nWe will have increased indebtedness following completion of the merger in comparison to our recent historical basis, which could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our interest expense. We will also incur various costs and expenses associated with the financing of the merger. The amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the merger and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the merger. The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the merger could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the merger, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service its indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nCertain of the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the merger may bear interest at variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating organization\u2019s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. In connection with the debt financing, it is anticipated that we will seek ratings of our indebtedness from Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future.\nPrior to the completion of the merger, in addition to the debt financing contemplated by the debt financing commitments, we intend to offer additional WESCO common stock or other equity or equity-linked securities in connection with the financing of the cash required to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nMoreover, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThe agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the merger will contain various covenants that impose restrictions on WESCO and certain of its subsidiaries that may affect their ability to operate their businesses.\nThe agreements that will govern the debt financing to be incurred in connection with the merger will contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the our ability (and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries) to, among other things, incur liens, incur debt, engage in mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, transfer assets outside the ordinary course of business, make loans or other investments, pay dividends, repurchase equity interests, make other payments with respect to equity interests, repay or repurchase subordinated debt and engage in affiliate transactions. In addition, the agreements that will govern the debt financing will contain a financial covenant that will require us to maintain certain financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations.\nOur pending acquisition of Anixter raises other risks.\nOur pending acquisition of Anixter, and upon completion thereof, our ownership of Anixter raise additional risks not described above. For additional information, see (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-4, which contains a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the merger, filed by us on February 7, 2020, including the section entitled \"Where You Can Find More Information\" included therein, and (ii) Anixter's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K, as updated by its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.", "PERMNO": 86876, "SIC": 5063, "TIC": "WCC"}
