{"cik": "1284812", "company": "COHEN & STEERS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA significant portion of our revenue for 2015 was derived from a single institutional client.\nAt December 31, 2015, our largest institutional client, Daiwa Asset Management, which holds accounts across numerous strategies and in subadvisory and model-based accounts and products, represented approximately 12% of our total revenue for 2015. Approximately 50% of the institutional account assets we managed and approximately 25% of our total assets under management were derived from this client. In addition, approximately 17% of our assets under advisement were derived from this client. Loss of, or significant withdrawal of assets from, any of these accounts would reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition.\nA decline in the absolute or relative performance of real estate securities would have an adverse effect on the assets we manage and our revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2015, a significant majority of the assets we managed were concentrated in real estate securities. Real estate securities and real property investments owned by the issuers of real estate securities are subject to varying degrees of risk that could affect any returns we realize. Returns on investments in real estate securities depend on the amount of income and capital appreciation or loss realized by the underlying real property. Income and real estate values may be adversely affected by, among other things, the cost of compliance with applicable laws, interest rates, the availability of financing, the creditworthiness of the tenants, and the limited ability of issuers of real estate securities to vary their portfolios promptly in response to changes in market conditions. If the underlying properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, the income and the ability of an issuer of real estate securities to pay interest and principal on debt securities or any dividends on common or preferred stocks will be adversely affected. A decline in the performance of real estate securities would have an adverse effect on the assets we manage, reducing the fees we earn and our revenue.\nSupport provided to new products may reduce fee income, increase expenses and expose us to potential losses on invested capital.\nFrom time to time, we may support the development of new investment products by waiving a portion of the fees we receive for managing such products, by subsidizing expenses or by making seed investments. Seed investments in new products utilize Company capital that would otherwise be available for general corporate purposes and expose us to capital losses, which we do not currently hedge. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $15.2 million of losses on seed investments, excluding loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, the majority of which was unrealized. To the extent that realized losses are not offset by capital gains, we cannot claim any tax benefits, which could result in an increase in our tax provision and effective tax rate. Accordingly, losses on our seed investments could reduce our earnings and have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nIncreased competition from investment managers that charge lower fees may force us to reduce the fees we charge for our services which could have a negative impact on our revenue.\nIncreased competition from investment managers, including passive investment managers, that offer products and services at lower fees has resulted in downward pressure on fees in certain segments of the investment management industry. In order to maintain our current fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to provide clients with investment returns and service that will encourage them to pay our fees. In the event our competitors charge lower fees for substantially similar products and services, we may be forced to reduce our fees in order to attract and retain clients, which would have a negative impact on our revenue.\nOur growth may be constrained by the size and number of real estate securities issuers, as well as real estate investment trust ownership restrictions.\nInvestments in real estate securities continue to play an important role in our overall business strategy. Our ability to continue to increase our ownership of real estate securities depends in part on growth in the size and number of issuers in the real estate securities market, particularly in the U.S. Our ability to increase our ownership is also constrained by REIT ownership limits which limit ownership of a REIT\u2019s outstanding capital stock, common stock, and/or preferred stock. Although certain REITs in which we invest have granted us waivers from these ownership limits to allow greater investment, such REITs retain the right to revoke or reduce the waiver limits at any time. As a result of these constraints, we have in the past, and may in the future, be prevented from acquiring new or additional real estate securities, which may limit our ability to increase the assets we manage and our revenue.\nOur clients may withdraw or reduce the amount of assets we manage or otherwise change the terms of our relationship which could have an adverse impact on our revenue.\nOur institutional clients, and firms with which we have strategic alliances, may terminate their relationship with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets we manage, shift their funds to other types of accounts with different fee structures, or renegotiate the fees we charge them for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance. Certain investors in the funds that we manage hold their shares indirectly through platforms sponsored by financial institutions that have the authority to make investment and asset allocation decisions on behalf of such shareholders. Decisions to redeem assets may cause the fund to sell assets at a disadvantageous time or price which could negatively affect the value of our assets under management. In a declining market or in conditions of poor relative or absolute performance, the pace of redemptions and withdrawals, and the loss of institutional and individual separate account clients could accelerate. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.\nThe inability to access clients through third-party intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn recent years, a significant portion of the growth we have experienced in the assets we manage has been from assets obtained through third-party intermediaries. Our ability to distribute our funds is highly dependent on access to the client bases and product platforms of international, national and regional securities firms, banks, insurance companies, defined contribution plan administrators and other intermediaries which generally offer competing investment products. In addition, our separate account business and subadvisory services depend in part on recommendations by consultants, financial planners and other professional advisers, as well as our existing clients.\nThe structure and terms of the distribution arrangements with intermediaries, including fees paid by us or our funds to intermediaries to assist with distribution efforts and the ability of our funds to participate in these intermediary platforms, are subject to changes driven by market competition and regulatory developments. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain access to these channels. Loss of any of these third-party distribution channels, or changes to their structure and terms, or any reduction in our ability to access clients and investors through existing and new distribution channels, could adversely affect our business.\nRegulations restricting the use of commission credits to pay for research could result in increased expenses.\nOn behalf of our clients, we make decisions to buy and sell securities, select broker/dealers to execute trades and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with these transactions, we may receive commission credits to pay for research from broker/dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. New regulations outside the U.S. may restrict or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to use commission credits to pay for research, which could increase our operating expenses.\nLimitations on our ability to utilize leverage in the closed-end funds we sponsor could reduce our assets under management and revenue.\nCertain of the closed-end funds sponsored by us utilize leverage in the form of bank financing, which in the aggregate amounted to $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2015. To the extent any closed-end fund sponsored by us elects or is required by regulation or the terms of its bank financing to reduce leverage, such fund may need to liquidate its investments. Reducing leverage or liquidation during adverse market conditions could reduce the Company's assets under management and revenue.\nThe growth of our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to manage the costs associated with the implementation of our business strategy.\nOur business strategy continues to involve diversifying our investment management business to include products and services outside of investments in U.S. real estate securities. As part of the implementation of our strategy, we have emphasized the development of broader real assets strategies, including commodities, global listed infrastructure, and natural resource equities, and have expanded our geographical presence outside the U.S. This has entailed hiring additional portfolio managers and additional personnel to support our strategies. As a result, our fixed costs and other expenses have increased due to expenses incurred to support the development of new strategies and to enhance our infrastructure, including additional office space, increased travel and technology and compliance resources. The success of our business strategy and future growth is contingent upon our ability to continue to support the development and implementation of new strategies and products and our ability to successfully manage multiple offices and navigate legal and regulatory systems both domestically and internationally. In the future, we may not have sufficient resources to adequately support our growth.\nWe could suffer financial losses in earnings or revenue if our reputation is harmed.\nOur reputation is important to the success of our business. We believe that the Cohen & Steers brand has been, and continues to be, well received globally both in our industry and with our clients, reflecting the fact that our brand, like our business, is based in part on trust and confidence. Our reputation may be harmed by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, poor investment performance, the dissemination by current or former clients of unfavorable opinions relating to our services, and the imposition of legal or regulatory sanctions or penalties in connection with our business activities. If our reputation is harmed, existing clients may reduce amounts held in, or withdraw entirely from, funds or accounts that we advise, or funds or accounts may terminate their relationship with us. In addition, reputational harm may cause us to lose current employees and we may be unable to attract new ones with similar qualifications or skills. If we fail to address, or appear to fail to address, successfully and promptly the underlying causes of any reputational harm, we may be unsuccessful in repairing any existing harm to our reputation and our future business prospects would likely be affected. The loss of either client relationships or personnel could reduce our assets under management, revenue and earnings.\nWe could incur financial losses, reputational harm, and regulatory penalties if we fail to implement effective information security policies and procedures.\nWe are dependent on the effectiveness of our information security policies and procedures to protect our computer, network and telecommunications systems and the data that reside in or are transmitted through them.\nAs part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients' portfolios as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity, including misappropriation of Company assets, fraudulent financial reporting, and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected and remediated. However, our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access or may be corrupted by cyber attacks, computer viruses or other malicious software code, or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information. Although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our mobile electronic hardware, if such hardware is stolen, misplaced or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk. Breach of our technology systems could result in the loss of valuable information, liability for stolen assets or information, remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach, additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents and litigation costs resulting from the incident. Moreover, loss of confidential client information could harm our reputation, result in the termination of contracts by our existing clients and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. Although we may have limited coverage under our existing insurance policies, we do not currently maintain insurance coverage that specifically protects against cyber risks. As such, we may be liable for all losses incurred in connection with a cyber attack.\nFailure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its products.\nSignificant portions of our business operations and those of our critical third-party service providers are concentrated in a few geographic areas, including New York and New Jersey. Critical operations that are geographically concentrated in New York include portfolio management, trading operations, information technology, investment administration, and portfolio accounting services for the Company\u2019s products and services. Should we, or our critical service providers, experience a material local or regional disaster or other significant business disruption, our ability to remain operational will depend in part on the safety and availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, network, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. We have developed backup systems and contingency plans, but we cannot ensure that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. In addition, we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster recovery support, and we cannot ensure that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. Failure by us, or our critical service providers, to maintain up to date business continuity plans, including system backup facilities, would impede our ability to operate in the event of a significant business disruption, which could result in financial losses to the Company and our clients and investors.\nThe failure of a key vendor to fulfill its obligations to the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its products.\nWe depend on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, fund accounting, custody and transfer agent roles and other operational needs. The failure or inability of the Company to diversify its sources for key services or the\nfailure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational issues for the Company and certain of its products, which could result in financial losses for the Company and its clients.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nA majority of our common stock is owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which may limit the ability of other stockholders to influence the affairs of the Company.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer beneficially owned approximately 51% of our common stock as of December 31, 2015. As long as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer own a majority of our common stock, they will have the ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nelect all of the members of our board of directors, thereby controlling the management and affairs of the Company;\n\u2022\ndetermine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nprevent any unsolicited acquisition of us and, consequently, adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on their shares.\nThe interests of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may differ from those of other stockholders in instances where, for example, management compensation is being determined or where an unsolicited acquisition of us could result in a change in our management. The concentration of beneficial ownership in our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence the affairs of the Company.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the issuance of additional shares will dilute your percentage ownership in the Company.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 23,316,493 shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2015, may sell shares of our common stock in the open market, subject to any restrictions imposed by U.S. federal securities laws on sales by affiliates.\nIn addition, in connection with our initial public offering in 2004, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and certain of their affiliates which requires us to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, shares of our common stock (and other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of common stock) held by them under certain circumstances. In August 2015, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended, covering (i) the resale of up to an aggregate of 23,578,122 shares owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and (ii) the offer and sale of up to 10,000,000 shares by us to the public. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and any additional shares that we issue will dilute your percentage ownership in the Company.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain certain anti-takeover provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company without negotiating with our board of directors. Such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company\u2019s common stock. Certain of these provisions allow the Company to issue preferred stock with rights more senior to those of the common stock, impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions and set forth rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or other unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess acquisition proposals. However, these provisions apply even if an acquisition proposal may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition. In the event that our board of directors determines that a potential business combination transaction would be beneficial to the Company and its stockholders, such stockholders may elect to sell their shares in the Company and the trading price of our common stock could decrease.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes in the U.S. and internationally.\nWe continue to operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to new regulations and revisions to, and evolving interpretations of, existing regulations in the U.S. and internationally.\nIn the U.S., the SEC proposed a number of significant regulations in 2015 that, if adopted, would significantly affect the operation and management of our U.S. registered funds and increase our operating expenses. Specifically, the SEC proposed the following:\n\u2022\nthe Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release, which would increase the frequency of, and expand the information provided in, our funds' SEC filings;\n\u2022\nthe Open-End Fund Liquidity Risk Management Programs, Swing Pricing, which would require a fund to classify each of its holdings based on how quickly the holding (or a portion thereof) could be converted to cash and to hold a minimum amount of highly liquid assets; and\n\u2022\nthe Use of Derivatives by Regulated Investment Companies and Business Development Companies, which would limit the amount of derivatives in which a fund could transact.\nOutside the U.S., the European Commission is in the process of formulating rules and regulations under MiFID II and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation. These, together with the changes contemplated by AIFMD, will have direct and indirect effects on our operations in the European Economic Area, including marketing restrictions and increased compliance, disclosure and other obligations, which could impact our ability to expand in these markets.\nThe foregoing regulatory changes and other reforms, including changes to laws affecting the tax status of REITs, may result in changes to our business operations and increased expenses.\nOur involvement in legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMany aspects of our business involve risks of legal liability. Various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment related claims. From time to time, we receive subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities and third parties in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations or proceedings. In addition, certain of the funds that the Company manages may become subject to lawsuits, any of which could potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the applicable fund for any resulting damages.\nWe carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. We cannot guarantee that our insurance will cover most liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed, or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies are due for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income.\nThe tax treatment of certain of our funds involves the interpretation of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no precedent may be available and may be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of certain of our funds depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. U.S. federal income tax rules are constantly under review by the IRS and the U.S. Department of Treasury, frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established concepts, statutory changes, revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations. Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof could cause us to change our investments and commitments, affect the tax considerations of an investment in us and change the character or treatment of portions of our income. In addition, the Company may be required to make certain assumptions when electing a particular tax treatment. It is possible that the IRS could assert successfully that the assumptions made by us do not satisfy the technical requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and/or Treasury Regulations and could require items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, including interest deductions, be adjusted, reallocated or disallowed in a manner that adversely affects us and our clients.", "PERMNO": 90303, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "CNS"}
