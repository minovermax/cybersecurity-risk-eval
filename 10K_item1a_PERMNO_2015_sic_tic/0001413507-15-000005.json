We do not make, nor have we authorized any other person to make, any representation about the future market value of our common stock. In addition to the other information contained in this annual report, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Strategy\nAn extended or further decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our financial commitments.\nThe prices we will receive for our oil and natural gas will significantly affect many aspects of our business, including our revenue, profitability, access to capital, quantity and present value of proved reserves and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. In the last two years, oil prices have fallen from highs of over $100 per Bbl to lows of under $40 per Bbl and natural gas prices have experienced declines of comparable magnitude. Oil and natural gas prices will likely continue to be volatile in the future and will depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe actions of OPEC;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or hostilities in oil-producing and natural gas-producing regions and related sanctions, including current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in Africa, South America, Russia and Ukraine;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and domestic natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and domestic natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nprevailing prices on local oil and natural gas price indexes in the areas in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals and gathering, processing and transportation availability;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nauthorization of exports from the United States of liquefied natural gas or oil;\n\u2022\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022\nprice and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nLower oil and natural gas prices will reduce our cash flows and our borrowing ability. Our business has historically relied on the availability of additional capital, including proceeds from the sale of equity and convertible securities, to execute our business strategy. Further, our future growth strategy requires substantial additional capital, the availability of which will depend in significant part on current and expected commodity prices. If we are unable to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future, we may be unable to pursue our current acquisition, drilling and development plans. While our current revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of up to $500 million, actual borrowings may not exceed our borrowing base in effect at any time, which is subject to re-determination on a semi-annual basis. Our borrowing base is based in substantial part on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves which are, in turn, impacted by prevailing oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, declining oil and natural gas prices have a direct impact on the amount we can borrow under our revolving credit facility, which could affect our cash flows and ability to execute on our business plans.\nIn addition, lower prices have reduced and may further reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and may cause the value of our estimated proved reserves at future reporting dates to decline compared to the value of our estimated proved reserves at August 31, 2015, our most recent fiscal year end.\nTo attempt to reduce our price risk, we periodically enter into hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our expected future production. We cannot assure you that such transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in oil or natural gas prices. Hedging arrangements can expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when production is less than expected, a counterparty to a hedging contract fails to perform under the contract or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging contract and the actual prices received.\nAny substantial or extended decline in the prices we receive for our production would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and our results of operations.\nOperating hazards may adversely affect our ability to conduct business.\nOur operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions including blowouts, cratering and explosions;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;\n\u2022\nequipment failures, fires or accidents;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental risks; and\n\u2022\nshortages in experienced labor or shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses to us from injury and loss of life, damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations. We do not maintain insurance for all of these risks, nor in amounts that cover all of the losses to which we may be subject, and the insurance we have may not continue to be available on acceptable terms. Moreover, some risks we face are not insurable. Also, we could in some circumstances have liability for actions taken by third parties over which we have no or limited control, including operators of properties in which we have an interest. The occurrence of an uninsured or underinsured loss could result in significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, maintenance activities undertaken to reduce operational risks can be costly and can require exploration, exploitation and development operations to be curtailed while those activities are being completed.\nOur actual production, revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves. We may experience production that is less than estimated, and drilling costs that are greater than estimated, in our reserve report. These differences may be material.\nAlthough the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows attributable to those reserves were prepared by Ryder Scott, our independent petroleum and geological engineers, we are ultimately responsible for the disclosure of those estimates. Reserve engineering is a complex and subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:\n\u2022\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from similar producing wells;\n\u2022\nthe assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and work-over and remedial costs.\nBecause all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items may differ from those assumed in estimating proved reserves:\n\u2022\nthe quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered;\n\u2022\nthe production and operating costs incurred;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of future development expenditures; and\n\u2022\nfuture oil and natural gas sales prices.\nHistorically, there has been a difference between our actual production and the production estimated in a prior year\u2019s reserve report. We cannot assure you that these differences will not be material in the future.\nApproximately 73% of our estimated proved reserves at August 31, 2015 are undeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Our estimates of proved undeveloped reserves reflect our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert those reserves into proved developed reserves, including approximately $481.2 million in estimated capital expenditures during the five years ending August 31, 2020. The estimated development costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop proved undeveloped reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting rules, proved undeveloped reserves generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the\ndate of initial booking, and we may therefore be required to downgrade to probable or possible any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed or expected to be developed within this five-year time frame.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted cash flows is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows from proved reserves at August 31, 2015 is based on twelve-month average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. These prices and costs will change and may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by oil and natural gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation may also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure of discounted cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with accounting requirements is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our operations or the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of our estimated oil and gas reserves.\nSeasonal weather conditions, wildlife restrictions and other constraints could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations.\nOur operations could be adversely affected by weather conditions and wildlife restrictions. In the Rocky Mountains, certain activities cannot be conducted as effectively during the winter months. Winter and severe weather conditions limit and may temporarily halt operations. These constraints and resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operational and capital costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, some of our properties are located in relatively populated areas in the Wattenberg Field, and our operations in those areas may be subject to additional expenses and limitations. In addition, a critical habitat designation for certain wildlife under the U.S. Endangered Species Act or similar state laws could result in material restrictions to public or private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. The listing of certain species as threatened or endangered could have a material impact on our operations in areas where such listed species are found.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop, produce and acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Drilling activities may be unsuccessful or may be less successful than anticipated.\nIn order to maintain or increase our reserves, we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. We must do this even during periods of low oil and natural gas prices when it is difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance our exploration, development and acquisition activities. Without successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our reserves and revenues will decline rapidly. We may not be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have access to necessary financing for these activities, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs, drilling results and the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates regarding potential well communication issues and other matters affecting the spacing of our wells. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil and natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may differ materially from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business and reserves.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient quantities to cover drilling, operating and other costs. In addition, even a commercial well may have production that is less, or costs that are greater, than we projected. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property. There can be no assurance that proved or unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such proved or unproved property or wells.\nWe may not be able to obtain adequate financing when the need arises to execute our long-term operating strategy.\nOur ability to execute our long-term operating strategy is highly dependent on our having access to capital when the need arises. We historically have addressed our liquidity needs through credit facilities, issuances of equity and debt securities, sales of assets, joint ventures and cash provided by operating activities. We will examine the following alternative sources of capital in light of economic conditions in existence at the relevant time:\n\u2022\nborrowings from banks or other lenders;\n\u2022\nthe sale of non-core assets;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of debt securities;\n\u2022\nthe sale of common stock, preferred stock or other equity securities;\n\u2022\njoint venture financing; and\n\u2022\nproduction payments.\nThe availability of these sources of capital when the need arises will depend upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include general economic and financial market conditions, oil and natural gas prices, our credit ratings, interest rates, market perceptions of us or the oil and gas industry, our market value and our operating performance. We may be unable to execute our long-term operating strategy if we cannot obtain capital from these sources when the need arises.\nOil and natural gas prices may be affected by local and regional factors.\nThe prices to be received for our production will be determined to a significant extent by factors affecting the local and regional supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including the adequacy of the pipeline and processing infrastructure in the region to process, and transport our production and that of other producers. Those factors result in basis differentials between the published indices generally used to establish the price received for regional natural gas production and the actual (frequently lower) price we receive for our production. These differentials are difficult to predict and may widen or narrow in the future based on market forces. The unpredictability of future differentials makes it more difficult for us to effectively hedge our production. Many of our hedging arrangements are based on benchmark prices and therefore do not protect us from adverse changes in the differential applicable to our production.\nLower oil and natural gas prices may cause us to record ceiling test write-downs, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting to account for our oil and natural gas operations. Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore for and develop oil and natural gas properties. Under full cost accounting rules, the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties may not exceed a \u201cfull cost ceiling\u201d which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. If, at the end of any fiscal period, we determine that the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceed the full cost ceiling, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings in the period then ended. This is called a \u201cceiling test write-down.\u201d This charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date.\nWe review the net capitalized costs of our properties quarterly, using a single price based on the beginning-of-the-month average of oil and natural gas prices for the preceding 12 months. We also assess investments in unproved properties periodically to determine whether impairment has occurred. The risk that we will be required to further write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile. In addition, write-downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, or if estimated future development costs increase. For the year ended August 31, 2015, we recognized a $16.0 million impairment related to our ceiling test calculations during the year. We may experience further ceiling test write-downs or other impairments in the future. In addition, any future ceiling test cushion would be subject to fluctuation as a result of acquisition or divestiture activity.\nWe cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate and we are unable to ensure the proper operation and profitability of these non-operated properties.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operation of these properties. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on our partially owned properties operated by others therefore will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s:\n\u2022\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpertise and diligence in adequately performing operations and complying with applicable agreements;\n\u2022\nfinancial resources;\n\u2022\ninclusion of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022\nuse of technology.\nAs a result of any of the above or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest, our allocated production revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our lack of control over non-operated properties makes it more difficult for us to forecast future capital expenditures and production.\nWe are dependent on third party pipeline, trucking and rail systems to transport our production and, in the Wattenberg Field, gathering and processing systems to prepare our production. These systems have limited capacity and at times have experienced service disruptions. Curtailments, disruptions or lack of availability in these systems interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas we produce, and could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The marketability of our oil and natural gas and production, particularly from our wells located in the Wattenberg Field, depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, processing, pipeline, trucking and rail systems. The amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, accidents, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, lack of contracted capacity on such systems, inclement weather, labor or regulatory issues or other interruptions. A portion of our production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time as a result of these factors. Curtailments and disruptions in these systems may last from a few days to several months or longer. These risks are greater for us than for some of our competitors because our operations are focused on areas where there has been a substantial amount of development activity in recent years and resulting increases in production, and this has increased the likelihood that there will be periods of time in which there is insufficient midstream capacity to accommodate the increased production. For example, the gas gathering systems serving the Wattenberg Field have in recent years experienced high line pressures, and at times this has reduced capacity and caused gas production to either be shut in or flared. In addition, we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. Any significant curtailment in gathering, processing or pipeline system capacity, significant delay in the construction of necessary facilities or lack of availability of transport, would interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas we produce, and could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations and the expected results of our drilling program. We may face similar risks in other areas.\nWe may be unable to satisfy our contractual obligations to deliver oil from our own production or other sources.\nWe have entered into agreements that require us to deliver minimum amounts of crude oil to a third party marketer and to two counterparties that transport crude oil via pipelines. Pursuant to these agreements, we must deliver specific amounts, either from our own production or from oil we acquire, over the next five years. Beginning in October of 2015, we must deliver a combined volume of 6,157 Bbls of oil per day to two of these counterparties. We have also committed to deliver 5,000 Bbls of oil per day to the third counterparty for five years beginning in the latter half of the 2016 calendar year. In addition, we have committed to deliver 7,500 Bbls of oil per day for the remainder of calendar 2015 to a third party refiner. If we are unable to fulfill all of our contractual delivery obligations from our own production, we may be required to pay penalties or damages pursuant to these agreements or we may have to purchase oil from third parties to fulfill our delivery obligations. This could adversely impact our cash flows, profit margins and net income.\nWe face strong competition from larger oil and natural gas companies that may negatively affect our ability to carry on operations.\nWe operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. Factors that affect our ability to compete successfully in the marketplace include:\n\u2022\nthe availability of funds for, and information relating to, properties;\n\u2022\nthe standards established by us for the minimum projected return on investment; and\n\u2022\nthe transportation of natural gas and crude oil.\nOur competitors include major integrated oil companies, substantial independent energy companies, affiliates of major interstate and intrastate pipelines and national and local natural gas gatherers, many of which possess greater financial and other resources than we do. If we are unable to successfully compete against our competitors, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions, which may negatively affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions of oil and gas businesses and properties have been an important element of our business, and we will continue to pursue acquisitions in the future. In the last several years, we have pursued and consummated acquisitions that have provided us opportunities to grow our production and reserves. Although we regularly engage in discussions with, and submit proposals to, acquisition candidates, suitable acquisitions may not be available in the future on reasonable terms. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition, finance the acquisition or, if the acquisition occurs, effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing business. Negotiations of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired business operations may require a disproportionate amount of management\u2019s attention and our resources. Even if we complete additional acquisitions, any new businesses may not generate revenues comparable to our existing business, the anticipated cost efficiencies or synergies may not be realized and these businesses may not be integrated successfully or operated profitably. The success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves associated with the acquired assets, rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from the reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our inability to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions may negatively affect our results of operations.\nEven though we perform due diligence reviews (including a review of title and other records) of the major properties we seek to acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, these reviews are inherently incomplete. It is generally not feasible for us to perform an in-depth review of every individual property and all records involved in each acquisition. Moreover, even an in-depth review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential liabilities or other problems or permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. We may assume known and unknown environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with the acquired businesses and properties. The discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions could harm our results of operations.\nIn addition, acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. Our credit facility contains, and future debt agreements may contain, covenants that limit our ability to complete acquisitions.\nWe may incur substantial costs to comply with the various federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our oil and natural gas operations.\nWe are affected significantly by a substantial number of governmental regulations that increase costs related to the drilling, completion, production, and abandonment of wells, the transportation and processing of oil and natural gas, the management and disposal of waste, and other aspects of our operations. It is possible that the number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future. In Colorado, for example, significant governmental regulations have been adopted in recent years to address well siting, well construction, hydraulic fracturing, water quality, public safety, air emissions, aesthetics, waste management, spill reporting, land reclamation, wildlife protection, and data collection. These government regulatory requirements may result in substantial costs that are not possible to pass through to our customers and could impact the profitability of our operations.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety, land use, environmental protection or the oil and natural gas industry generally. Legislation affecting the industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion,\nfrequently increasing our regulatory burden. Compliance with such laws and regulations often increases our cost of doing business and, in turn, decreases our profitability. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations, or the issuance of cease and desist orders.\nThe environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject may, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire us to apply for and receive a permit before drilling commences or certain associated facilities are developed;\n\u2022\nrestrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and production activities;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, threatened and endangered species habitat and other protected areas;\n\u2022\nrequire remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells; and\n\u2022\nimpose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance, and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our earnings, results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Changes to the requirements for drilling, completing, operating, and abandoning wells and related facilities could have similar adverse effects on us.\nNew environmental legislation or regulatory initiatives, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning health, safety, and environmental protection. Government authorities frequently add to those requirements, and both oil and gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing specifically are receiving increased regulatory attention. Our operations utilize hydraulic fracturing, an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, proppant, and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production.\nIn 2012, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission controls for natural gas processing operations, as well as for oil and natural gas production. Among other things, the latter rules cover the completion and operation of hydraulically fractured gas wells and associated equipment. After several parties challenged the new air regulations in court, the EPA reconsidered certain requirements and amended the rules in 2013 and 2014. In August 2015, the EPA proposed a package of additional emission control requirements that likewise cover the completion and operation of hydraulically fractured wells and associated equipment. At this point, we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with them.\nSome activists have attempted to link hydraulic fracturing to various environmental problems, including potential adverse effects on drinking water supplies as well as migration of methane and other hydrocarbons. As a result, the federal government is studying the environmental risks associated with hydraulic fracturing and evaluating whether to adopt additional regulatory requirements. For example, the EPA has commenced a multi-year study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, and the draft results were released for public and peer review in June 2015. In addition, in February 2014, the EPA issued final guidance for underground injection permits that regulate hydraulic fracturing using diesel fuel, where the EPA has permitting authority under the SDWA. This guidance eventually could encourage other regulatory authorities to adopt to permitting and other restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing. In May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under TSCA to obtain data on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. In April 2015, the EPA proposed regulations under the CWA to impose pretreatment standards on wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing activities. Aside from the EPA, the BLM has issued new rules for hydraulic fracturing activities involving federal and tribal lands and minerals that, in general, would cover disclosure of fracturing fluid components, wellbore integrity, and handling of flowback and produced water, and OSHA has proposed stricter standards for worker exposure to silica, which would apply to use of sand as a proppant for hydraulic fracturing. In 2013, OSHA proposed regulations lowering the permissible exposure limit for airborne silica, and OSHA and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health have issued hazard alerts to the hydraulic fracturing industry regarding risks to workers from silica exposure and other hazards, which include recommendations to reduce those risks and proposals for additional study of the industry.\nIn the United States Congress, bills have been introduced from time to time that would amend the SDWA to eliminate an existing exemption for certain hydraulic fracturing activities from the definition of \"underground injection,\" thereby requiring the oil and natural gas industry to obtain SDWA permits for fracturing not involving diesel fuels, and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the process. If adopted, such legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the\nfederal level, but some form of chemical disclosure is already required by most oil and gas producing states. At this time, it is not clear what action, if any, the United States Congress will take on hydraulic fracturing.\nApart from these ongoing federal initiatives, state governments where we operate have moved to impose stricter requirements on hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of oil and gas production. Colorado, for example, comprehensively updated its oil and gas regulations in 2008 and adopted significant additional amendments in 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Among other things, the updated and amended regulations require operators to reduce methane emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing, compile and report additional information regarding wellbore integrity, satisfy more stringent reclamation and remediation standards, avoid certain wildlife habitat, publicly disclose the chemical ingredients used in hydraulic fracturing, increase the minimum distance between occupied structures and oil and gas wells, undertake additional mitigation for nearby residents, implement additional groundwater testing, and take additional actions to prevent blowouts and avoid subsurface well communication. Colorado has also adopted new regulations for air emissions from oil and gas operations as well as new legislation and implementing regulations increasing the monetary penalties for regulatory violations and lowering the threshold for reporting spills. Additionally, local governments are adopting new requirements on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations, including local county and city governments in Colorado.\nThe trend toward stricter standards and greater enforcement in environmental legislation and regulation is likely to continue. For example, concern has recently arisen in several states over increasing numbers of earthquakes that may be associated with underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas wastewater. Such concerns could eventually limit the use of such wells in certain areas and increase the cost of disposal in others. Similarly, concerns have recently been expressed over the flaring of natural gas associated with crude oil production in certain areas, and the BLM is expected to propose new regulations in 2015 or 2016 for flaring involving federal land and minerals. These concerns and regulations could limit or increase the cost of crude oil production in certain areas. Other environmental issues and concerns may periodically arise in the future and lead to new and additional legislative and regulatory initiatives.\nThe adoption of future federal, state or local laws or implementing regulations or orders imposing new environmental obligations on, or otherwise limiting, our operations could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our costs of compliance and doing business, delay or prevent the development of certain resources (including especially shale formations that are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing), or alter the demand for and consumption of our products and services. We cannot assure you that any such outcome would not be material, and any such outcome could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.\nAny local moratoria or bans on our activities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome local governments are adopting new requirements and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations. Some local governments in Colorado, for instance, have amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and gas development, while other local governments have entered memoranda of agreement with oil and gas producers to accomplish the same objective. Beyond that, during the past few years a total of five Colorado cities have passed voter initiatives temporarily or permanently prohibiting hydraulic fracturing. The oil and gas industry and the State of Colorado have challenged four of these initiatives in court, and the trial courts in three of the cases have invalidated the initiatives. In September 2015, the Colorado Supreme Court announced that it would review two of these cases for the purpose of deciding whether local hydraulic fracturing bans are preempted.\nIn addition, during 2014, opponents of hydraulic fracturing sought statewide ballot initiatives that would have restricted oil and gas development in Colorado. These initiatives were withdrawn in return for the creation of a task force to craft recommendations for minimizing land use conflicts over the location of oil and gas facilities. Although the task force has completed its work, opponents of hydraulic fracturing could still pursue state legislation or additional local or statewide ballot initiatives to restrict hydraulic fracturing or oil and gas development generally. If we are required to cease operating in any of the areas in which we now operate as the result of bans or moratoria on drilling or related oilfield services activities, it could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nOur operations could result in liability for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages. We could also be liable for environmental damages caused by previous property owners. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We maintain insurance coverage for our operations, but this insurance may not extend to the full potential liability to which we may be subject and further may not cover\nall potential environmental damages. Accordingly, we may be subject to liability or may lose the ability to continue exploration or production activities upon substantial portions of our properties if certain environmental damages occur.\nFor example, over the years we have owned or leased numerous properties for oil and natural gas activities upon which petroleum hydrocarbons or other materials may have been released by us or by predecessor property owners or lessees who were not under our control. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, including CERCLA, RCRA and state laws, we could be held liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination at such locations regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or whether the operations at the time of the release were standard industry practice.\nSimilarly, the OPA imposes a variety of regulations on \u201cresponsible parties\u201d related to the prevention of oil spills. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, environmental laws or regulations, including regulations promulgated pursuant to the OPA, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act authorizes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. Regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act may, among other things, require us to comply with margin requirements in connection with our derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. If we are required to post cash collateral in connection with some or all of our derivative positions, this would make it difficult or impossible to pursue our current hedging strategy. The regulations may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. The regulations may also reduce the number of potential counterparties in the market, which could make hedging more expensive.\nIf we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, our results of operations may be more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, derivative instruments create a risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when production is less than the volume covered by the instruments.\nProposed changes to U.S. tax laws, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time legislative proposals are made that would, if enacted, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws. These proposed changes have included, among others, eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, eliminating the deduction from income for domestic production activities relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development, repealing the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties and extending the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Such proposed changes in the U.S. tax laws, if adopted, or other similar changes that reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.\nAs of August 31, 2015, the aggregate amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $78 million, which could have important consequences for you, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe covenants contained in our credit facility limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations and may limit our flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022\nthe amount of our interest expense may increase because amounts borrowed under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates, which, if interest rates increase, could result in higher interest expense;\n\u2022\nwe may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially extended or further declines in oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u2022\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough cash to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory conditions and other factors that are beyond our control, including the prices that we receive for our oil and natural gas production.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow and existing capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce our planned capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt, and any of these actions, if completed, could adversely affect our business and/or our shareholders. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, in a timely manner or at all. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future and any such alternative measures may be unsuccessful or may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity.\nRestrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nOur credit facility contains, and future debt agreements may contain, covenants that restrict or limit our ability to:\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrepurchase, redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate or assume certain liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmerge or to enter into other business combination transactions; or\n\u2022\nengage in certain other corporate activities.\nAlso, our credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial tests. Our ability to comply with these ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet these ratios and tests in the future. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the restrictive covenants under our credit facility. Future debt agreements may have similar, or more restrictive, provisions.\nA breach of any of the covenants in our debt agreements or our inability to comply with the required ratios or tests could result in a default under the agreement. A default, if not cured or waived, could result in all indebtedness outstanding under the agreement becoming immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may not be able to pay all such debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could accelerate the maturity of the debt or proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such defaulted debt.\nOur two co-Chief Executive Officers may allocate some portion of their time to other business interests, which could have a negative impact on our operations.\nOur two co-Chief Executive Officers have other business interests to which they allocate a portion of their professional time. Because of this, their employment agreements provide that they are only obligated to devote eighty percent of their time to our affairs. While in the past they have devoted substantially all of their time to our business, they could allocate more of their time to these other interests, which could have a negative impact on our operations.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect potential acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.\nOur management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC to implement Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management in our annual report on Form 10-K regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nSubstantially all of our producing properties are located in the D-J Basin in Colorado, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nOur operations have been focused on the D-J Basin in Colorado, which means our current producing properties and new drilling opportunities are geographically concentrated in that area. Because our operations are not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of any regional events, including fluctuations in prices of oil and natural gas produced from the wells in the region, natural disasters, restrictive governmental regulations, transportation capacity constraints, weather, curtailment of production or interruption of transportation and processing services, and any resulting delays or interruptions of production from existing or planned new wells.\nFailure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations.\nInformation technology solution failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer, employee or other information, or damage to our reputation. A system failure or data security breach may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations. When drought conditions occur, governmental authorities may restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs economically, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is restricted.\nSince inception, we have not paid any cash dividends on common stock. Cash dividends are restricted under the terms of our credit facility and we presently intend to continue the policy of using retained earnings for expansion of our business. Any future dividends also may be restricted by future agreements.\nOur stock price could be volatile, which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In particular, the market price of our common stock, like that of the securities of other energy companies, has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nFrom time to time, there has been limited trading volume in our common stock. In addition, there can be no assurance that there will continue to be a trading market or that any securities research analysts will continue to provide research coverage with respect to our common stock. It is possible that such factors will adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nThe market valuation of our business may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control and the value of the investment of our stockholders may fluctuate correspondingly.\nThe market valuations of energy companies, such as us, frequently fluctuate due to factors unrelated to the past or present operating performance of such companies. Our market valuation may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022Changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u2022Fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes, particularly among securities of energy companies;\n\u2022Changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new acquisitions, discoveries, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022Variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022Loss of a major customer;\n\u2022Loss of a relationship with a partner; and\n\u2022Additions or departures of key personnel.\nAs a result, the value of your investment in our common stock may fluctuate.\nAdditional financings may subject our existing stockholders to significant dilution.\nTo the extent that we raise additional funds or complete acquisitions by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Our access to the financial markets and the pricing and terms we receive in those markets could be adversely impacted by various factors, including changes in general market conditions and commodity price changes.", "PERMNO": 12906, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SRCI"}
