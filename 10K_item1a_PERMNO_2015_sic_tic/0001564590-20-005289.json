The applicable regulatory requirements cover virtually all phases of the operations of our institutions, including educational program offerings, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing and recruiting, financial operations, payment of refunds to students who withdraw, financial aid to students, acquisitions or openings of new institutions, additions of new educational programs, closure or relocation of existing locations and changes in corporate structure and ownership. ED is our primary federal regulator pursuant to the Higher Education Act.\nA significant portion of our students rely on Title IV Programs, and we derive a substantial majority of our revenue and cash flows from Title IV Programs. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 81% of all our students who were in a program of study at any date during that year participated in Title IV Programs, which resulted in Title IV Program cash receipts recorded by the Company of approximately $436 million.\nOur institutions participate in Title IV Programs and are subject to extensive regulation by ED, various state agencies and accrediting commissions. To participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by ED, and be certified by ED as an eligible institution. Most ED requirements are applied on an institutional basis, with each institution assigned an identification number known as an OPEID, or Office of Postsecondary Education Identification number. Each institution\u2019s branches and other locations, regardless of whether they are campus-based or online, are assigned to the institution\u2019s OPEID.\nThe regulations, standards and policies of our regulators change frequently and are subject to interpretation, particularly where they are crafted for traditional, academic term-based institutions rather than our module-based academic delivery model. Changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations or standards could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under Title IV Programs, or costs of doing business.\nIf we violate any applicable regulations, standards or policies, we may be subject to the following sanctions, among others, imposed by any one or more of the relevant regulatory agencies or other government bodies:\n\u2022\nimposition of monetary fines or penalties, including imposition of a letter of credit requirement;\n\u2022\nrepayment of funds received under Title IV or other federal programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on, or termination of, our institutions' eligibility to participate in Title IV or other federal programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nlimits on, or termination of, our institutions' operations or ability to grant degrees and certificates;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on, or revocation of, our institutions' accreditations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to open new institutions or offer new programs;\n\u2022\ncostly investigations, litigation or other adversarial proceedings; and\n\u2022\ncivil or criminal penalties levied against us or our institutions.\nIn addition, findings or allegations of noncompliance may subject us to qui tam lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act, under which private plaintiffs seek to enforce remedies on behalf of the U.S. and, if successful, are entitled to recover their costs and to receive a portion of any amounts recovered by the U.S. in the lawsuit. We may also be subject to other types of lawsuits or claims by third parties. The costs of these proceedings may be significant and we may not have sufficient resources to fund any material adverse outcomes.\nAny of the penalties, injunctions, restrictions, lawsuits or other forms of censure discussed above could have a material adverse effect on the number of students who choose to enroll at our institutions, our profitability, our cash and short term investment balances, our ability to conduct our business as presently conducted or as we desire to in the future and our reputation. If we lose Title IV Program eligibility, we would experience a dramatic decline in revenue and we would be unable to continue our business as it currently is conducted.\nCongress may revise the laws governing Title IV Programs or reduce funding for those and other student financial aid programs, and ED may revise its regulations administering Title IV programs, any of which could reduce our student enrollments and revenue and increase costs of operations. The results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections are likely to significantly impact the nature of future changes.\nThe U.S. Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and other laws governing Title IV Programs and annually determines the funding level for each Title IV Program. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation-Legislative Action and Recent ED Regulatory Initiatives,\u201d for more information about the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Both major political parties have conveyed significantly different views on how they would propose to reauthorize the Title IV Programs and the various conditions on program or institutional eligibility they would require. As a result, the outcome of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections is likely to significantly impact the outcome of the Higher Education Act reauthorization process and therefore the extent to which any legislation, if adopted, could materially affect our business is uncertain. However, scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the ongoing policy differences in Congress regarding spending levels could lead to significant regulatory changes in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and many of these changes may be adverse to postsecondary institutions generally or for-profit institutions specifically.\nED has promulgated a substantial number of new regulations in recent years that impact our business, including but not limited to multiple versions of the \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d regulations discussed in a separate risk factor below and the recently rescinded gainful employment regulation, as well as compensation rules for persons engaged in certain aspects of admissions and financial aid, state authorization, determination of attendance and definitions of a \u201ccredit hour\u201d and a \u201csubstantial misrepresentation\u201d which became effective on July 1, 2011. These and other regulations have had significant impacts on our business, requiring a large number of reporting and operational changes and resulting in changes to and elimination of certain educational programs. Future regulatory actions by ED or other agencies that regulate our institutions are likely to occur and to have significant impacts on our business, by requiring us to change our business practices and incur costs of compliance and of developing and implementing changes in operations. For example, if there is a change in ED administration and policy objectives following the 2020 Presidential election, a new version of gainful employment regulations may be adopted. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation-Legislative Action and Recent ED Regulatory Initiatives,\u201d for a brief overview of the former gainful employment regulations and the recent rescission, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 contains more detail regarding the recently rescinded regulations.\nBecause a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from Title IV Programs, any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces Title IV Program funding or the ability of our students to participate, or that places significant additional burdens on our ability to participate, may significantly reduce the number of students who enroll at our institutions, our revenue and our profitability.\nIf we fail to comply with state laws and regulatory requirements, including new state legislative or regulatory initiatives affecting our institutions, we could incur financial penalties, restrictions on our operations and reduced student enrollments.\nOur institutions are subject to the laws and regulations of the states where our physical campuses are located, and are also subject to laws and regulations in other states in which they enroll and/or recruit students. State laws establish standards for, among other things, student instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities and financial policies. State education laws and regulations may limit our institutions\u2019 ability to operate or to award degrees or certificates or offer new programs. Moreover, under the Higher Education Act, approval by such agencies is necessary to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. In addition, we are subject to state consumer protection laws.\nAttorneys general in many states have become more active in enforcing consumer protection laws, in particular related to recruiting practices and the financing of education at for-profit educational institutions. Further, some state attorneys general have partnered with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission to review industry practices. These actions increase the scrutiny of the marketing and advertising practices of educational institutions, making our operating environment more challenging and increasing the risk of claims of noncompliance. In addition, adverse media coverage regarding the allegations of state consumer protection law violations by us or other for-profit education companies could damage our reputation, result in deceased enrollments, revenues and profitability, and have a negative impact on our stock price. Such coverage could also result in continued scrutiny and regulation by ED, Congress, accrediting commissions, state legislatures, state attorneys general or other governmental authorities of for-profit educational institutions generally or the Company specifically. See the risk factor below regarding our agreements with multiple state attorneys general and the FTC to resolve their inquiries which impact our future operations.\nState legislatures often consider legislation affecting regulation of postsecondary educational institutions. For example, some states have proposed legislation that would prohibit enrollment of their residents based on a state and federal funding threshold that is more restrictive than the current federal 90/10 Rule and that would implement a state level version of ED\u2019s recently rescinded gainful employment regulations.\nIf we are unable to comply with current or future state consumer protection, licensing, authorization or other requirements, or determine that we are unable to cost effectively comply with new or changed requirements, we could be subject to monetary fines or\npenalties or limitations on the manner in which we conduct our business, we could incur substantial compliance costs or be required to modify our operations in order to comply or we could lose enrollments, revenue and eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs in any affected states. Loss of authorization in one or more states could increase the likelihood of additional scrutiny and potential loss of authority in other states, which would further impact our business.\nOur agreements with multiple state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission may lead to unexpected impacts on our student enrollments or higher than anticipated expenses, and a failure to comply may lead to additional enforcement actions.\nIn recent years, states and other regulatory bodies have increased their focus on the for-profit postsecondary education sector. This includes increased activity by state attorneys general and the FTC in their review of the sector. In this regard, in 2019 the Company entered into agreements with the FTC and attorneys general from 48 states and the District of Columbia to bring closure to inquiries by them. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Accreditation, Jurisdictional Authorizations and Other Compliance Matters - Other Compliance Matters\u201d for information about these agreements. These agreements could ultimately have negative impacts on our business, any one of which could be material. For example, pursuant to the agreements with the attorneys general we agreed to work with a third-party administrator that will report annually for three years on the Company\u2019s compliance with various obligations the Company committed to in the agreements. Any negative findings by the third-party administrator may result in negative consequences to the Company, such as an extension of the time period during which the Company must work with the third party administrator or an action by one or more attorneys general seeking enforcement of the agreements. Further, our provision of materials and information in accordance with the terms of the agreements that do not align with those provided by other institutions could negatively impact student decisions to enroll or remain enrolled at our institutions. Pursuant to the agreement with the FTC, we agreed to the operation of a system to monitor lead aggregators and generators involving a compliance review by, or on behalf of, the Company of the various sources a prospective student interacts with prior to the Company\u2019s purchase and use of the prospective student lead. The compliance costs related to these agreements may be greater than anticipated and may have a negative impact on our ability to compete effectively and maintain and grow student enrollments at our institutions, and a failure to comply may lead to additional enforcement actions by the state attorneys general and the FTC.\nIf one or more of our institutions fails to maintain institutional accreditation, or if certain of our programs cannot obtain or maintain programmatic accreditation, our student enrollments would diminish and our business would suffer.\nInstitutional Accreditation. In the U.S., accrediting agencies periodically review the academic quality of an institution's instructional programs and its administrative and financial operations to ensure that the institution has the resources to perform its educational mission. ED relies on accrediting agencies to assess whether an institution's educational programs qualify the institution to participate in Title IV Programs. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Accreditation, Jurisdictional Authorizations and Other Compliance Matters - Institutional Accreditation.\u201d\nThe failure to comply with accreditation standards will subject an institution to additional oversight and reporting requirements, accreditation proceedings such as a show-cause directive, an action to defer or deny action related to an institution's application for a new grant of accreditation or an action to suspend an institution's accreditation or a program's approval. For example, in August 2016 HLC adopted policy changes giving the Commission discretion to designate an institution as a school \u201cin financial distress\u201d or \u201cunder government investigation.\u201d These designations may result in additional monitoring and/or financial reporting by the institution and a strict scrutiny review by HLC of any requests for substantive change at the institution, requiring the institution to demonstrate a compelling reason for the change and that it has sufficient resources to support the change. In 2019 we resolved inquiries by the FTC and multiple state attorneys general. If similar inquiries occur in the future, the breadth of the conditions that could result in these designations may cause our HLC-accredited institutions, CTU and AIU, to be labeled with one or possibly both.\nIf our institutions or programs are subject to accreditation actions or are placed on probationary accreditation status, we may experience additional adverse publicity, impaired ability to attract and retain students and substantial expense to obtain unqualified accreditation status. The inability to obtain reaccreditation following periodic reviews or any final loss of institutional accreditation after exhaustion of the administrative agency processes would result in a loss of Title IV Program funds for the affected institution and its students. Such events and any related claims brought against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProgrammatic Accreditation. Many states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited. While programmatic accreditation is not a sufficient basis to qualify for institutional Title IV Program certification, programmatic accreditation may improve employment opportunities for program graduates in their chosen field. Those of our programs that do not have such programmatic accreditation, where available, or fail to maintain such accreditation, may experience adverse publicity, declining enrollments, litigation or other claims from students or suffer other adverse impacts, which could result in it being impractical for us to continue offering such programs.\nED Recognition of Accrediting Agencies. Our participation in Title IV Programs is dependent on ED continuing to recognize the accrediting agencies that accredit our institutions. The standards and practices of these agencies have become a focus of attention by state attorneys general, members of Congress, ED\u2019s Office of Inspector General and ED over recent years. This focus may make the accreditation review process longer and potentially more challenging for our institutions when they undergo their normal accreditation\nreview processes. HLC, which accredits CTU and AIU, along with other ED recognized accreditors are facing increased political pressure as part of this recognition process to apply heightened levels of scrutiny or review and/or apply new requirements or standards to for-profit institutions. These pressures may result in future modifications to HLC\u2019s accreditation criteria, practices or other policies and procedures, which our universities may not be able to comply with.\nOur institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or have other limitations placed upon them if the percentage of their revenues derived from those programs is too high.\nAny of our institutions or OPEIDs may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs if, on modified cash basis accounting, the percentage of the cash receipts derived from Title IV Programs for two consecutive fiscal years is greater than 90%. Under the 90-10 Rule, an OPEID that derives more than 90% of its cash receipts from Title IV sources for a fiscal year will be placed on provisional participation status for its next two fiscal years. We have substantially no control over the amount of Title IV student loans and grants sought by or awarded to our students. In addition, if the OPEID violates the 90-10 Rule and becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs but continues to disburse Title IV Program funds, ED would require repayment of all Title IV Program funds received by it after the effective date of the loss of eligibility.\nSeveral factors such as the increase in Title IV Program aid availability, including year-round Pell Grant funds, and budget-related reductions in state grant programs, workforce training programs and other alternative funding sources have adversely affected our institutions' 90-10 Rule percentages in recent years, and we expect this negative impact to continue. We have implemented various measures intended to reduce the percentage of our institution's cash basis revenue attributable to Title IV Program funds, including AIU\u2019s deferred receipt of Title IV Program funds in 2019 within the parameters permitted by ED cash management regulations. Another potential measure is adjusting tuition, but tuition adjustments adversely impact students and could adversely affect our enrollments. However, these measures may not be adequate to prevent our institutions' 90-10 Rule percentages from exceeding 90% in the future.\nThe ability of our institutions to maintain 90-10 rates below 90% will depend on the composition of our future student population and their personal circumstances and regulatory and other factors outside of our control, including any reduction in government education assistance for military personnel, including veterans, or changes in the treatment of such funding for purposes of the 90-10 rate calculation.\nCurrently, government education assistance for military personnel, including veterans, is not treated as revenue from Title IV sources and therefore is included in the \u201c10%\u201d portion of the calculation. However, multiple legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress that would revise the 90-10 Rule to consider government education assistance for military personnel, including veterans, in the same manner as Title IV funds for purposes of the rule and to revise the 90-10 Rule to an 85-15 rule. If adopted, these proposals would make it more difficult for our institutions to comply with the 90-10 Rule.\nIn addition, there is a lack of clarity regarding some of the technical aspects of the calculation methodology under the 90-10 Rule, which may lead to regulatory action or investigations by ED. Changes in, or new interpretations of, the calculation methodology or other industry practices under the 90-10 Rule could further significantly impact our compliance with the 90-10 Rule, and any review or investigation by ED involving us could require a significant amount of resources.\nED has broad discretion to impose additional sanctions on institutions that fail the 90-10 Rule limit, but there is only limited precedent available to predict what those additional sanctions might be in the future. ED could specify a wide range of additional conditions as part of the provisional certification and the institutions' continued participation in Title IV Programs. These conditions may include, among other things, restrictions on the total amount of Title IV Program funds that may be distributed to students attending the institutions; restrictions on programmatic and geographic expansion; requirements to obtain and post letters of credit; and additional reporting requirements to include additional interim financial or enrollment reporting.\nSee Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation - Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations - \u201890-10 Rule,\u2019\u201d for more information about the 90-10 Rule and the measures we have implemented to improve our compliance.\nIf any of our institutions lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs due to violation of the 90-10 Rule, the institution would experience a dramatic decline in revenue and would be unable to continue its business as it currently is conducted. Efforts to reduce the 90-10 Rule percentage for our institutions have and may in the future involve taking measures that involve interpretations of the 90-10 Rule that are without clear precedent, reduce our revenue or increase our operating expenses (or all of the foregoing, in each case perhaps significantly). If the 90-10 Rule is not changed to provide relief for for-profit institutions, we may be required to make structural changes to our business to remain in compliance, which changes may materially alter the manner in which we conduct our business and materially and adversely impact our revenue and operating costs. Furthermore, these required changes could make more difficult our ability to comply with other important regulatory requirements, such as the cohort default rate regulations.\n\u201cBorrower defense to repayment\u201d regulations, including closed school discharges, may subject us to significant repayment liability to ED for discharged federal student loans and posting of substantial letters of credit that may limit our ability to make investments in our business which could negatively impact our future growths.\nOn October 28, 2016, ED adopted regulations that cover multiple issues including the processes and standards for the discharge of student loans, which are commonly referred to as \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d regulations. Included in the 2016 regulations were expansions of ED\u2019s authority to process group discharge claims and authority to seek recoupment from institutions. On September 23, 2019, ED published new final \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d regulations that become effective on July 1, 2020. Which processes and standards apply is determined by the date a student loan is disbursed, and student loans disbursed before July 1, 2017 will follow ED\u2019s original discharge standards and processes that specify that a borrower may assert a defense to repayment based on an act or omission by the school that would give rise to a cause of action under state law. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation-Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations - Borrower Defense to Repayment,\u201d for more information about the borrower defense to repayment regulations.\nIn addition to discharge of student loans based on an act or omission by a school, ED regulations provide that upon the closure of an institution participating in the Title IV Programs, including any location thereof, certain students who had attended such an institution or location may be eligible to obtain a \u201cclosed school discharge\u201d of their federal student loans related to attendance at that institution or location, if they do not complete their educational programs at another location or online, or through transfer or teach-out with other postsecondary institutions. In order to obtain a closed school discharge, a student generally must have been enrolled or on an approved leave of absence when the institution or location closed. ED regulations historically also provide that students who withdraw from an institution or location within 120 days prior to the closure may receive a closed school discharge; this time period was expanded to 180 days under the 2019 borrower defense to repayment regulations. Additionally, under the 2016 regulations, ED may grant automatic closed school discharges to students who do not re-enroll in another Title IV-participating institution within three years after becoming unable to complete their educational program due to a closure of their institution or institutional location. Recently, ED has asserted loan discharge claims against us relating to closed campuses in our former All Other Campuses reporting segment for select students that withdrew or were dismissed from school just prior to a campus closure, despite the availability of a teach-out and opportunity to complete. In addition, pursuant to our pending acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Trident University International, Trident\u2019s operations will be brought within the scope of AIU\u2019s current state licensure, accreditation and ED approval, with Trident relinquishing its accreditor and ED approvals. As a result, we may incur closed school discharge liabilities if students do not complete their educational program after the closing of the transaction.\nED\u2019s interpretation and enforcement of the different versions of the borrower defense to repayment regulations, including closed school discharges, and the related processes and standards is uncertain. If ED determines that a significant number of borrowers who attended our current, former or acquired institutions have a defense to repayment of their student loans, we could be subject to significant repayment liability to ED, which may limit our ability to make investments in our business and negatively impact our future growth.\nIn addition to potential liability associated with loan discharges, both the 2016 and 2019 borrower defense to repayment regulations include discussion of triggering events that would provide ED discretion regarding periodic determinations of our financial responsibility and associated enhanced financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or other security it determines it needs. If in the future we are required to post a letter of credit pursuant to the borrower defense to repayment regulations, we may not have the capacity to do so. Even if we are able to post any required letter of credit, doing so may limit our ability to make investments in our business which could negatively impact our future growth.\nWe cannot predict the impact the various defense to repayment regulations will have on student enrollments, the volume of future claims for loan discharge, or our future financial responsibility as determined by ED, all of which could be materially adverse.\nA failure to demonstrate \"financial responsibility\" or \"administrative capability\" would have negative impacts on our operations.\nAll higher education institutions participating in Title IV Programs must, among other things, satisfy financial and administrative standards. Failure to meet these standards will subject an institution to additional monitoring and reporting procedures, the costs of which may be significant; alterations in the timing and process for receipt of cash pursuant to Title IV Programs; a requirement to submit an irrevocable letter of credit to ED in an amount equal to 10-100% of the Title IV Program funds that the institution received during its most recently completed fiscal year; or provisional certification for up to three years; depending on the level of compliance with the standards and ED\u2019s discretion. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation - Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations,\u201d for more information about the standards of financial responsibility and administrative capability and the alternative ways an institution may establish eligibility to continue to participate in Title IV Programs.\nIf in the future we are required to satisfy ED's standards of financial responsibility on an alternative basis, including potentially by posting irrevocable letters of credit, we may not have the capacity to post these letters of credit.\nAccreditor and state regulatory requirements also address financial responsibility, and these requirements vary among agencies and also are different from the ED requirements. Any developments relating to our satisfaction of ED's financial responsibility\nrequirements may lead to additional focus or review by our accreditors or applicable state agencies regarding their respective financial responsibility requirements.\nIf our institutions fail to maintain financial responsibility or administrative capability, they could lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, have that eligibility adversely conditioned or be subject to similar negative consequences under accreditor and state regulatory requirements, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, limitations on participation in Title IV Programs as a result of the failure to demonstrate financial responsibility or administrative capability could materially reduce the enrollments and revenue at the impacted institution, and a termination of participation would cause a dramatic decline in revenue and we would be unable to continue our business as it currently is conducted.\nOur institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or have other limitations placed upon them if their student loan cohort default rates are greater than the standards set by ED.\nTo remain eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, our institutions must maintain student loan cohort default rates below specified levels. Each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (ending September 30). The applicable cohort default rate for each cohort is the percentage of the students in the cohort who default on their student loans prior to the end of the two following federal fiscal years, which represents a three-year measuring period. If an educational institution\u2019s cohort default rate exceeds the applicable standards, it may be required to delay for 30 days the release of the first disbursement of U.S. federal student loan proceeds to first time borrowers, establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate, be subject to provisional certification imposing various additional requirements for participating in Title IV Programs or, depending on the duration or magnitude of the compliance failure, cease participation in Title IV Programs.\nSee Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation - Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations - Student Loan Default Rates,\u201d for more information about cohort default rates, ED\u2019s standards and penalties applicable thereto as well as the rates for our institutions.\nIf either of our institutions loses eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs due to student loan default rates being higher than ED\u2019s thresholds, we would experience a dramatic decline in revenue and we would be unable to continue our business as it currently is conducted.\nIf ED denies, or significantly conditions, recertification of either of our institutions to participate in Title IV Programs, that institution could not conduct its business as it is currently conducted.\nUnder the provisions of the Higher Education Act, an institution must apply to ED for continued certification to participate in Title IV Programs at least every six years or when it undergoes a change of control. Each institution is assigned an identification number by ED known as an OPEID, or Office of Postsecondary Education Identification number, with each institution\u2019s branches and additional locations assigned to the main campus\u2019 OPEID. Generally, the recertification process includes a review by ED of an institution\u2019s educational programs and locations, administrative capability, financial responsibility and other oversight categories. AIU is currently operating on a provisional program participation agreement due to open reviews. During the period of provisional certification, an institution must obtain prior ED approval to add an educational program, open a new location or make any other significant change, which could negatively impact our ability to take these actions.\nIf ED finds that any of our institutions do not fully satisfy all required eligibility and certification standards, ED could limit, suspend or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV Programs. Continued Title IV program eligibility is critical to the operation of our business. If either of our institutions becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs, or have that participation significantly conditioned, it could not conduct its business as it is currently conducted and we would experience a dramatic decline in revenue.\nGovernment and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews and audits or bring actions against us that could result in monetary liabilities, injunctions, loss of eligibility for Title IV Programs or other adverse outcomes.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to compliance reviews and audits as well as claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties. We have had significant matters pending against us in the past which have resulted in the payment of significant amounts to settle the matters and our agreement to ongoing compliance and operational matters. In this regard, see Item I, \u201cBusiness - Accreditation, Jurisdictional Authorizations and Other Compliance Matters - Other Compliance Matters,\u201d for discussion of agreements undertaken in connection with several recently resolved pending matters. From time to time, we identify compliance deficiencies that we must address and, where appropriate, report such deficiencies to ED. Such reporting, even in regard to a minor or inadvertent compliance issue, could result in a more significant compliance review by ED or even a full recertification review, which may require the expenditure of substantial administrative time and resources to address. If the result of any proceeding is unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of Title IV funding, injunctions or other penalties. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from\nour ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those actions. Claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation or adversely affect our stock price, even if such actions are eventually determined to be without merit.\nWe need timely approval by applicable regulatory agencies to offer new programs or make substantive changes to existing programs.\nOur institutions frequently need to obtain approvals from regulatory agencies in the conduct of their business. For example, to establish a new educational program or substantive changes to existing programs, we are required to obtain the appropriate approvals from ED and applicable state and accrediting regulatory agencies. Staffing levels at ED and other regulatory agencies and the volume of applications and other requests may delay our receipt of necessary approvals. Further, approvals may be conditioned or denied in a manner that could significantly affect our strategic plans and future growth. Approval by these regulatory agencies may also be negatively impacted due to regulatory inquiries or reviews and any adverse publicity relating to such matters or the industry generally.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur financial performance depends on the level of student enrollments in our institutions.\nEnrollment of students at our institutions is impacted by many of the regulatory risks discussed above and business risks discussed below, many of which are beyond our control. We also believe that the level of our student enrollments is affected by changes in economic conditions, although the nature and magnitude of this effect are uncertain and may change over time. For example, during periods when the unemployment rate declines or remains stable, prospective students may have more employment options, leading them to choose to work rather than to pursue postsecondary education. On the other hand, high unemployment rates may affect the willingness of students to incur loans to pay for postsecondary education or to pursue postsecondary education in general.\nAffordability concerns and negative perception of the value of a college degree increase reluctance to take on debt and make it more challenging for us to attract and retain students. We may experience decreasing enrollments in our institutions due to changing demographic trends in family size, overall declines in enrollment in postsecondary institutions, job growth in fields unrelated to our core disciplines or other societal factors. Further, we continue to make investments in our business which are designed to improve student experiences, retention and academic outcomes and support the sustainable and responsible growth of our institutions. The success of these initiatives may reduce over time.\nOur student enrollments could suffer from any of these circumstances. It is likely that legislative, regulatory, and economic uncertainties will continue, and thus it is difficult to assess our long-term growth prospects. Reduced enrollments at our institutions, for any of the reasons mentioned or otherwise, generally reduce our profitability, which, depending on the level of the decline, could be material.\nWe compete with a variety of educational institutions, especially in the online education market, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our student enrollments and revenue could be adversely impacted.\nThe postsecondary education industry is highly fragmented and increasingly competitive. Our institutions compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges and universities, other for-profit institutions, other online education providers, and alternatives to higher education, such as immediate employment and military service. Some public and private institutions charge lower tuition for courses of study similar to those offered by our institutions due, in part, to government subsidies, government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources not available to for-profit institutions, and this competition may increase if additional subsidies or resources become available to those institutions. For example, a typical community college is subsidized by local or state government and, as a result, tuition rates for associate\u2019s degree programs are much lower at community colleges than at our institutions. Several states have adopted or proposed programs to enable residents to attend community colleges for free.\nSome of our competitors are more widely known and have more established reputations than our institutions. Some may have greater financial and other resources than we have. In addition, some of our competitors are subject to fewer regulatory burdens on enrollment and financial aid processes, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students. In particular, some of our publicly traded for-profit competitors have converted to a structure where a for-profit service company provides services to a non-profit educational institution, which reduces the impact of certain regulations on their operations, such as the 90-10 Rule.\nWe also expect to experience increased competition as more postsecondary education providers increase their online program offerings (in particular programs that are geared towards the needs of working adults), including traditional and community colleges that had not previously offered online education programs, and increase their use of personalized learning technologies. This trend has been accelerated by companies that provide and/or manage online learning platforms for traditional colleges and community colleges. Increased competition may create greater pricing or operating pressure on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our institutions' enrollments, revenues and profit margins. We may also face increased competition in maintaining and developing new corporate partnerships and other relationships with employers, particularly as employers become more selective as to which online\nuniversities they will encourage or offer scholarships to their employees to attend and from which online universities they will hire prospective employees.\nCongress, ED and other agencies have required increasing disclosure of information to prospective students, and our agreements with multiple state attorneys general require additional disclosures that are not required by our competitors. Some of these disclosures may negatively impact a prospective student\u2019s decision to enroll in one of our institutions.\nAn increase in competition, particularly from traditional colleges with well-established reputations for excellence, may affect the success of our recruiting efforts to enroll and retain students who are likely to succeed in our educational programs, or cause us to reduce our tuition rates and increase our marketing and other recruiting expenses, which could adversely impact our profitability and cash flows.\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to develop awareness among, and enroll and retain, students in our institutions and programs in a cost effective manner.\nIf our institutions are unable to successfully market and advertise their educational programs, our institutions' ability to attract and enroll prospective students in those programs could be adversely affected. We have been investing in our student admissions and advising functions and other initiatives to improve student experiences, retention and academic outcomes. If these initiatives do not continue to succeed, our ability to attract, enroll and retain students in our programs could be adversely affected. Further, Internet and other technology, including data gathering and marketing and advertising, is changing fast and we may be unable to adapt our initiatives to attract, enroll and retain students in a timely manner. Consequently, our ability to increase revenue or maintain profitability could be impaired. Some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully marketing our institutions and the programs that they offer include, but are not limited to: student or employer dissatisfaction with our educational programs and services; diminished access to prospective students; our failure to maintain or expand our brand names or other factors related to our marketing or advertising practices; FTC or Federal Communications Commission restrictions on contacting prospective students, Internet, mobile phone and other advertising and marketing media; costs and effectiveness of Internet, mobile phone and other advertising programs; and changing media preferences of our target audiences.\nWe use third-party lead aggregators and generators to help us identify prospective students. The practices of some lead aggregators and generators have been questioned by various regulatory bodies, which could lead to changes in the quality and number of prospective student leads provided by these lead aggregators and generators as well as the cost thereof, which could in turn result in a reduction in the number of students we enroll. Further, the highly regulated nature of the postsecondary education industry and the resulting compliance measures undertaken by the industry are burdensome and some lead aggregators may choose not to work with us in favor of providing their services to different industries. In addition, the number of lead aggregators and generators has reduced over time due to consolidation in that industry, and this could exaggerate the indirect impact on us of any negative developments within that industry or with respect to any lead aggregator or generator with which we do business.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to keep pace with changing market needs and technology.\nIncreasingly, prospective employers of students who graduate from our institutions demand that their new employees possess appropriate technological skills and also appropriate \u201csoft\u201d skills, such as communication, critical thinking and teamwork skills. These desired skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment, so it is important for our institutions\u2019 educational programs to evolve in response to those economic and technological changes. Current or prospective students or the employers of our graduates may not accept expansion of our existing programs, improved program content and the development of new programs. Students and faculty increasingly rely on personal communication devices and expect that we will be able to adapt our information technology platforms and our educational delivery methods to support these devices and any new technologies that may develop. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new and improved programs in a cost-effective manner, our institutions may not be able to begin offering them as quickly as prospective students and employers would like or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, rapid technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired, the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could decline, and our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire, train and retain the personnel we need to sustain and grow our business.\nOur future success depends largely on the skills, efforts and motivation of our executive officers and other key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract and retain qualified managers and our institutions' ability to attract and retain qualified faculty members and administrators. If any of our executive officers leave the Company, it may be difficult to hire a replacement with similar experience and skills due to the highly regulated nature of our business. Loss of key personnel in the future could impact our growth, lead to changes in or create uncertainty about our business strategies or otherwise impact management's attention to operations. The political and regulatory uncertainty facing the for-profit postsecondary education industry may make it difficult to retain key personnel.\nOur success and ability to grow depend on the ability to hire, train and retain significant numbers of talented people. We face competition from companies in postsecondary education and other industries in attracting, hiring and retaining personnel who possess the combination of skills and experiences that we seek to implement our business strategy. In particular, our performance is dependent upon the availability and retention of qualified personnel for our student support operations. The negative publicity surrounding our industry sometimes makes it difficult and more expensive to attract, hire and retain qualified and experienced personnel, and ED\u2019s regulations related to incentive compensation affect our ability to compensate admissions and financial aid personnel. Our ability to effectively train our student support personnel and the length of time it takes them to become productive also impacts our results of operations.\nKey personnel may leave us and subsequently compete against us after any period they are contractually obligated not to pursue such activities. The loss of the services of our key personnel, or our failure to attract, train and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms and in a timely manner could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify, complete or integrate acquisitions, which could negatively impact our growth.\nWe continue to evaluate diverse strategies to enhance shareholder value, including acquisitions of high-quality educational institutions and programs. We may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition opportunities that complement our strategic direction or successfully completing transactions at prices we deem acceptable. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding for-profit postsecondary education institutions such as ours before and potentially following the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections is likely to enhance this difficulty. Further, the successful integration and profitable operation of an acquired institution or program, including our pending acquisition of Trident University International, involves significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully integrate the acquired operations and personnel into our institutions and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize anticipated cost savings and additional revenue opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of known and unknown liabilities, including borrower defense to repayment and closed school loan discharge liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of significant attention of our senior management from day-to-day operations; and\n\u2022\nissues not discovered in our due diligence process, including compliance issues, commitments and/or contingencies.\nAn acquisition related to an institution or other educational business often requires one or multiple regulatory approvals. If we are unable to obtain such approvals, or we obtain them on unfavorable terms, our ability to consummate a transaction may be impaired or we may be unable to operate the acquired business in a manner that is favorable to us. If we fail to properly evaluate an acquisition, we may be required to incur costs in excess of what we anticipated, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, such as goodwill.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, we review our non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, including goodwill, for impairment on at least an annual basis through the application of fair value-based measurements. On an interim basis, we review our assets and liabilities to determine if a triggering event had occurred that would result in it being more likely than not that the fair value would be less than the carrying amount for any of our reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Some factors that management considers when determining if a triggering event has occurred include reviewing the significant inputs to the fair value calculation and any events or circumstances that could affect the significant inputs, including, but not limited to, financial performance, legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, political, business or other factors, industry and market conditions as well as the most recent quantitative fair value analysis for each reporting unit and the amount of the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value. For example, the fair value for our AIU reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by $15.1 million as of the last quantitative assessment which equated its fair value to be approximately 129% of its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, based on discounted cash flow, and a market-based approach. To the extent the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will be required to record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). Our estimates of fair value are based primarily on projected future results and expected cash flows consistent with our plans to manage the underlying businesses. However, should we encounter unexpected economic conditions or operational results or need to take additional actions not currently foreseen to comply with current and future regulations, the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of our assets, estimate of future cash flows, revenue growth, and discount rates, could be negatively impacted and could result in an impairment of goodwill which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur credit facility and letters of credit are required to be 100% secured by cash and marketable securities and therefore may impact our liquidity.\nThe loans and letter of credit obligations under our credit facility are required to be 100% secured by cash and marketable securities deposited with the bank. Further, any settlements or negative decisions in regulatory proceedings or other legal actions\nagainst us may reduce existing available cash balances. We therefore may have liquidity needs in the future which the credit facility will not meet. For example, we may not have the capacity to post required letters of credit we may need in the future for state licensing requirements, if we are required to satisfy ED's standards of financial responsibility on an alternative basis or for other purposes due to insufficient cash available to provide security. If cash generated by operations and existing cash balances are insufficient in the future to support our cash requirements, we would need to pursue other sources of liquidity, if available, such as additional sources of credit which may be more expensive, issuance of stock to new investors or a sale of assets.\nWe rely on proprietary rights and intellectual property in conducting our business, which may not be adequately protected under current laws, and we may encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property of third parties.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, domain names and agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on service mark and trademark protection in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to our marks as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services. These measures may not be adequate, and we can\u2019t be certain that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights. Unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate the proprietary aspects of our curricula, online resource material and other content despite our efforts to protect these rights. Our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by these attempts, and we may need to use funds for lawsuits to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation.\nThese and other risks exist with respect to our intellipath\u00ae personalized learning technology, which incorporates technology that we have a perpetual but non-exclusive license to use. We receive software support for the intellipath technology from CCKF, a Dublin-based educational technology company in which we have an equity investment. If CCKF ceases to operate or otherwise becomes unable to work with our institutions, it would be necessary to either develop the ability to support the software using our own resources or engage another third party vendor to provide these services, which transition could be economically disadvantageous, cause an interruption in the use of the technology and present a distraction to management, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nWe may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. Third parties may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third party. Some third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid those intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit.\nRisks Related to Our Business Technology Infrastructure\nGovernment regulations relating to the Internet could increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe increasing use of the Internet and other online services has led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or in foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the Internet could increase our costs and adversely affect enrollments.\nWe are subject to privacy and information security laws and regulations due to our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of those laws or regulations, or any breach, theft or loss of that information, could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nOur efforts to attract and enroll students result in us collecting, using and keeping substantial amounts of personal information regarding applicants, our students, their families and alumni, including social security numbers and financial data. We also maintain personal information about our employees in the ordinary course of our activities. Our services, the services of many of our health plan and benefit plan vendors, and other information can be accessed globally through the Internet. We rely extensively on our network of interconnected applications and databases for day to day operations as well as financial reporting and the processing of financial transactions. Our computer networks and those of our vendors that manage confidential information for us or provide services to our students may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, inadvertent access or display, theft or misuse, hackers, computer viruses, or third parties in connection with hardware and software upgrades and changes. Such unauthorized access, misuse, theft or hacks could evade our intrusion detection and prevention precautions without alerting us to the breach or loss for some period of time or may never be detected. We have experienced malware and virus attacks on our systems which went undetected by our virus detection and prevention software. Regular patching of our computer systems and frequent updates to our virus detection and prevention software with the latest virus and malware signatures may not catch newly introduced malware and viruses or \u201czero-day\u201d viruses, prior to their infecting our systems and potentially disrupting our data integrity, taking sensitive information or affecting\nfinancial transactions. Because our services can be accessed globally via the Internet, we may be subject to privacy laws in countries outside the U.S. from which students access our services, which laws may constrain the way we market and provide our services. Any breach of student or employee privacy or errors in storing, using or transmitting personal information could violate privacy laws and regulations resulting in fines or other penalties. The adoption of new or modified state or federal data or cybersecurity legislation could increase our costs and require changes in our operating procedures or systems. An example of this is the California Consumer Privacy Act which became effective January 1, 2020. A breach, theft or loss of personal information held by us or our vendors, or a violation of the laws and regulations governing privacy could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or result in lawsuits, additional regulation, remediation and compliance costs or investments in additional security systems to protect our computer networks, the costs of which may be substantial.\nSystem disruptions and vulnerability from security risks to our online technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students.\nFor our online and ground-based campuses, the performance and reliability of program infrastructure is critical to their operations, reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any computer system error or failure, significant increase in traffic on our computer networks, or any significant failure or unavailability of our computer networks, including but not limited to those as a result of natural disasters and network and telecommunications failures, could materially disrupt our delivery of these programs. Any interruption to our institutions\u2019 computer systems or operations could have a material adverse effect on our student enrollments.\nOur computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, denial of service attacks and other security threats. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Due to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our networks hackers may target our networks. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. We cannot ensure that these efforts will protect our computer networks against security breaches despite our regular monitoring of our technology infrastructure security.\nThe success of our institutions\u2019 online programs depends, in part, on our institutions\u2019 ability to expand the content of their programs, develop new programs in a cost-effective manner, maintain good standing with regulators and accreditors, and meet students\u2019 needs in a timely manner. New programs can be delayed due to current and future unforeseen regulatory restrictions. Furthermore, our regulators may impose additional restrictions or conditions on the manner in which we offer online courses to our students, any one of which could negatively impact our business or results of operations.\nAny general decline in Internet use for any reason, including security or privacy concerns, cost of Internet service or changes in government regulation, could result in less demand for online educational services and inhibit growth in our online programs.\nWe may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions.\nIn some instances our faculty members or our students may post various articles or other third-party content on class discussion boards or download third-party content to personal computers. We may incur claims or liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and could impose a strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future, and as a result returns on an investment in our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has and may fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are not in our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe actual, anticipated or perceived impact of changes in the political environment or government policies;\n\u2022\nthe outcomes and impacts on our business of ED\u2019s rulemakings, and other changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate;\n\u2022\nnegative media coverage of the for-profit education industry;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the postsecondary education field, including declining enrollments;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, pendency or outcome of litigation, accreditation reviews, regulatory reviews, inquiries and investigations, and any related adverse publicity;\n\u2022\nfailure of certain of our institutions or programs to maintain compliance under the 90-10 Rule or other regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet or exceed, or changes in, expectations of analysts or investors, or the extent of analyst coverage of our company;\n\u2022\ndecisions by any significant investors to reduce their investment in us;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results, which sometimes occur due to AIU\u2019s academic calendar and significant\nexpense items that do not regularly occur;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, which may cause the market price for our common stock to fluctuate significantly more than the market as a whole; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nChanges in the trading price of our common stock may occur without regard to our operating performance, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company. Further, the trading volume of our common stock is relatively low, which may cause our stock price to react more to the above and other factors. The fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock may impact an investor\u2019s ability to sell their shares at the desired time at a price considered satisfactory, including at or above the price at which the investor acquired them.", "PERMNO": 85724, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "PRDO"}
