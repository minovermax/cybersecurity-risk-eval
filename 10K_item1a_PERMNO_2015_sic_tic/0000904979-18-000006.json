{"cik": "904979", "company": "SHILOH INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-01-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\n(amounts in thousands)\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA downturn in the global economy could harm demand for automotive and commercial vehicles that are manufactured with our products and, therefore, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe level of demand for our products depends primarily upon the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are manufactured with our products. The global economic recession that began in 2008 had a significant adverse effect on our business, customers and suppliers, and contributed to delayed and reduced purchases of passenger cars and commercial vehicles, including those manufactured with our products. Demand for and pricing of our products is also subject to economic conditions and other factors (e.g., energy costs, fuel costs, climate change concerns, vehicle age, consumer spending and preferences, materials used in production, commodity prices and changing technology) present in the various domestic and international markets in which our products are sold. If the global economy were to experience another significant downturn, depending upon its length, duration and severity, or any other event that results in a reduction of demand for automobiles, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nDeterioration in the United States and world economies could harm our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to access the capital markets, which may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our customers and suppliers by making it increasingly difficult for them to obtain financing for their businesses and for their customers to obtain financing for automobile purchases. Our OEM customers typically require significant financing for their respective businesses. This financing often comes from securitization markets, which experience severe disruptions during global economic crises. Our suppliers, as well as our customers\u2019 suppliers, may face similar difficulties in obtaining financing for their businesses. If capital is not available to our customers or suppliers, or if the cost of capital is prohibitively high, their businesses would be adversely affected, which could result in their restructuring or even reorganization or liquidation under applicable bankruptcy laws. Any such adverse effect on our customers or suppliers could materially adversely affect us, either through loss of revenues from any of our customers so affected, or due to our inability to meet our commitments without excess expense, as a result of disruptions in supply caused by the suppliers so affected. Financial difficulties experienced by any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on us if such customer were unable to pay for the products we provide or if we experienced a loss of, or material reduction in, business from such customer. As a result of such difficulties, we could experience lost revenues, significant write-offs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges, or additional restructurings. In addition, severe financial or other difficulties at any of our major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on us if we are unable to obtain on a timely basis and on similar economic terms the quantity and quality of components we require to produce products. Moreover, severe financial or operating difficulties at any automotive vehicle manufacturer or other significant supplier could have a significant disruptive effect on the entire industry, leading to supply chain disruptions and labor unrest, among other things. These disruptions could force OEMs and, in turn, other suppliers, including us, to shut down or reduce production at plants.\nOur inability to obtain and maintain sufficient capital financing may harm our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending, in part, on the level, variability and timing of our customers\u2019 production and the payment terms we have with our customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could be adversely affected if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or payment on delivery. If our available cash flows from operations is not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would likely look to our cash balances and borrowing availability under our Credit Agreement (as defined hereinafter) to satisfy those needs. In 2013, we and our subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement, dated October 25, 2013, as amended (the \"Credit Agreement\") with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, Dutch Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Syndication Agent, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers, CIBC Bank, USA, Compass Bank and The Huntington National Bank, N.A., as Co-Documentation Agents, and the other lender parties thereto. We entered into our eighth amendment to the Credit Agreement on October 31, 2017 (the \"Amendment\"), which, among other things, provides for an aggregate availability of $350 million, $275 million of which is available to the Company through the Tranche A Facility and $75 million of which is available to the Dutch borrower through the\nTranche B Facility, and eliminates the scheduled reductions in such availability; increases the aggregate amount of incremental commitment increases allowed under the Credit Agreement to up to $150 million subject to our pro forma compliance with financial covenants, the Administrative Agent\u2019s approval and the Company obtaining commitments for any such increase as well as other provisions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to satisfy the financial covenants currently under the Credit Agreement, that we will be able to enter into favorable amendments in the future, that alternative sources of additional capital will be available on satisfactory terms or at all or that we will otherwise continue to have the ability to maintain sufficient capital financing. Insufficient liquidity may increase the risk of not being able to produce products or having to pay higher prices for inputs that may not be recovered in selling prices.\nWe may pursue acquisitions or strategic alliances that we may not successfully integrate or that may divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances in the future. However, we may not be able to identify and secure suitable opportunities. Our ability to consummate and integrate effectively any future acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by a number of factors, such as competition for attractive targets and, to the extent necessary, our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nIn addition, if a potential acquisition target, joint venture, or strategic alliance candidate is identified, we may fail to enter into a definitive agreement with the candidate on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The negotiation and completion of potential acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances, whether or not ultimately consummated, could also require significant diversion of management\u2019s time and resources and could potentially disrupt our existing business. The expected synergies and cost savings from acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances may not be realized and we may not achieve the expected results, including the synergies and cost savings we expect to realize. We may also have to incur significant charges in connection with future acquisitions. Future acquisitions or strategic alliances could also potentially result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness, dilutive issuance of equity securities, costs and contingent liabilities. We may also have to obtain approvals and licenses from the relevant government authorities for such transactions to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased costs and delay. Future strategic alliances or acquisitions may expose us to additional potential risks, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\nuncertainties in assessing the value, strengths and potential profitability of, and identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks and contingent and other liabilities of, acquisition targets or other transaction candidates;\n\u2022\nour inability to generate sufficient revenue to recover costs and expenses of the strategic alliances or acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotential loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees, customers and suppliers; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in business, industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition rationale.\nAny of the above risks could significantly impair our ability to manage our business and materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to realize revenues represented by awarded business, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe realization of future revenues from awarded business is subject to risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that our customers will actually produce, the timing of that production and the mix of options that our customers may choose.\nIn addition to not having a commitment from our customers regarding the minimum number of products they must purchase from us if we obtain awarded business, the terms and conditions of the agreements with our customers typically provide that they have the contractual right to unilaterally terminate our contracts with only limited notice. If such contracts are terminated by our customers, our ability to obtain compensation from our customers for such termination is generally limited to the direct out-of-pocket costs that we incurred for inventory and not fully reimbursed tooling, and in certain rare instances, not fully depreciated capital expenditures.\nWe base a substantial part of planning on the anticipated lifetime revenues of particular products. We calculate the anticipated lifetime revenues of a product by multiplying our expected price for a product by the forecasted production volume for that product during the length of time we expect the related vehicle to be in production. We use third-party forecasting services to provide long-term forecasts, which allow us to determine how long a vehicle is expected to be in production. If we over-estimate\nthe production units or if a customer reduces its level of anticipated purchases of a particular platform as a result of reduced demand, our actual revenues for that platform may be substantially less than the lifetime revenues we had anticipated for that platform.\nTypically, it takes two to three years from the time a manufacturer awards a program until production begins. In many cases, we must commit substantial resources in preparation for production under awarded customer business well in advance of the customer\u2019s production start date. Our results of operations may be affected due to delay in recovering these types of pre-production costs if our customers cancel awarded business, including cancellation in the event technology supporting the awarded business becomes obsolete.\nWe are dependent upon large customers for current and future revenues. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of these customers or the loss of market share by these customers could materially harm us.\nWe depend on major vehicle manufacturers for a substantial portion of our net sales. For example, during 2017, General Motors and FCA accounted for 17.9% and 15.0% of our revenues, respectively. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations by reducing cash flows and our ability to spread costs over a larger revenue base. We may also make fewer sales to major customers for a variety of reasons other than losses of business relationships, including but not limited to: (1) reduced or delayed customer requirements; (2) strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by the customers; (3) reduced demand for our customers\u2019 products; or (4) loss of business to competitors.\nIn addition, our OEM customers compete intensively against each other and other OEMs. The loss of market share by any of our significant OEMs could have a material adverse effect on our business unless we are able to achieve increased sales to other OEMs.\nThe failure to be awarded new business for additional content on new or existing vehicle programs or to retain existing business could materially harm our business.\nWe compete for new business at the beginning of the development of new vehicle programs and upon the redesign of existing programs by major OEM customers. New program development generally begins three-to-five years prior to the marketing of the underlying vehicles to the public. Redesign of existing programs begins during the life cycle of a platform, usually at least two-to-three years before the end of the platform\u2019s life cycle. The failure to obtain new business on new programs or to retain or increase business on redesigned existing programs, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, as a result of the relatively long lead times required for many of our structural components, it may be difficult in the short term for us to obtain new revenues to replace any unexpected decline in the sale of existing products.\nIn addition, a component of our growth strategy is to bid on and be awarded new business for additional content on our customers\u2019 new or existing vehicle programs, while at the same time maintaining existing business that we have a desire to maintain and renew. If we are unable to introduce, differentiate and enhance our product offerings, anticipate industry trends or keep pace with technological developments or if our competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products that are perceived by our customers to compete with ours, we may be unable to grow and maintain our business with our customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.\nOur inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new program launches could harm our financial performance.\nIn connection with the award of new business, we obligate ourselves to deliver new products and services that are subject to our customers\u2019 timing, performance and quality standards. Additionally, as a Tier 1 supplier, we must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order for the program launches of our products to be successful. Given the complexity of new program launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers\u2019 introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could harm our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Finally, even if we successfully manage the timing, quality and cost of a new program launch with respect to our operations, our customers\u2019 production delays may be caused by another of our customers\u2019 suppliers, which could harm our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAutomotive production and sales are highly cyclical, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe highly cyclical nature of the automotive industry presents a risk that is outside our control and that often cannot be accurately predicted. The cyclical nature depends on general economic conditions and other factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences, patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs and the automobile replacement cycle. In addition, customer production changeovers or new program launches may result in altered or delayed production cycles, which may reduce or delay purchases of our products by our customers. As a result, automotive production and sales may fluctuate significantly from year-to-year and such fluctuations may give rise to changes in demand for our products. Our business is directly related to the volume of automotive production and, because it has significant fixed production costs, declines in our customers\u2019 production levels can have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. Decreases in demand for automobiles generally, or decreases in demand for our products in particular, could materially and harmfully affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe automotive industry is seasonal, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe automotive industry is seasonal. Some of our largest OEM customers typically shut down vehicle production during certain months or weeks of the year. For example, our OEM customers in Europe typically shut down operations during portions of July and August and additional periods during the December and January holiday season, while our OEM customers in North America typically close assembly plants for periods in June and July for model year changeovers and for additional periods during the December and January holiday season. During these downturns, our customers will generally reduce the number of production days because of lower demand and reduce excess vehicle inventory. Such seasonality, or unanticipated changes in plant shutdown schedules, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in technology and developments within the automotive industry could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe automotive industry is undergoing significant change, and we believe that the pace of that change will accelerate in the next several years. Technological changes, including the development of autonomous vehicles, new products and services, new business models or new methods of travel may disrupt the historic business model of the industry, reduce the demand for the purchase of automobiles, and adversely impact the sales of our customers as well as our sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent it from meeting customer demand, reduce our revenues or negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines or equipment within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\n\u2022\nunscheduled maintenance outages;\n\u2022\nprolonged power failures;\n\u2022\nan equipment failure;\n\u2022\nlabor difficulties;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;\n\u2022\nfires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural catastrophes;\n\u2022\nwar, terrorism or threats of terrorism or political unrest;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations or intervention; and\n\u2022\nother unexpected problems.\nAny such disruption could prevent us from meeting customer orders, reduce our revenues or profits and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe decreasing number of automotive parts suppliers and pricing pressures from our automotive customers could make it more difficult for us to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry.\nThe automotive parts industry is highly competitive. Bankruptcies and consolidation among automotive parts suppliers are reducing the number of competitors, resulting in larger competitors who benefit from purchasing and distribution economies of scale. Our inability to compete with these larger suppliers in the future could result in a reduction of, or inability to increase, revenues, which would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face significant competition within each of our major product areas. The principal competitive factors include price, quality, global presence, service, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, and timely delivery. We also face significant competitive pricing pressures from our automotive customers. Because of their purchasing size, our automotive customers can influence market participants to compete on price terms. If we are not able to offset pricing reductions resulting from these pressures by improving operating efficiencies and reducing expenditures, those pricing reductions may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry or that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our financial results.\nWe derived 19.5% of our revenue in fiscal year 2017 from our non-U.S. operations. The financial position and results of operations of certain of our international operations are measured using the foreign currency in the jurisdiction of those operations as the functional currency. As a result, we are exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from its international operations and in translating its financial results back to U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of our international operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. Our income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during each fiscal quarter. A strengthening U.S. dollar against relevant foreign currency reduces the amount of income we recognize from our international operations. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results. As exchange rates vary, our results of operations and profitability may be harmed. We may use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against certain foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations. The gains or losses associated with hedging activities may harm our results of operations. In addition, the portion of our revenue derived from international operations may increase in the future, due to the impact of its acquisitions and overall growth in foreign markets, among other reasons. The risks we face in foreign currency transactions and translation may continue to increase as we further develop and expand our international operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations.\nWe sell our products worldwide from our manufacturing and distribution facilities in various regions and countries, including the United States, Mexico, Europe and Asia. International operations are subject to various risks which could have a material adverse effect on those operations or our business as a whole, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to changes of trade policies and agreements, including changes in NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) and other international trade agreements;\n\u2022\nexposure to impact of tariffs or other forms of political incentive systems affecting international trade;\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic conditions and labor issues;\n\u2022\nexposure to local political conditions, including the risk of seizure of assets by a foreign government;\n\u2022\nexposure to local social unrest, including any resultant acts of war, terrorism or similar events;\n\u2022\nexposure to local public health issues and the resultant impact on economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ncontrols on the repatriation of cash, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in penetrating new markets due to established and entrenched competitors.\nThe U.S. Congress and Trump administration may make substantial changes to fiscal, political, regulation and other federal policies that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nChanges in general economic or political conditions in the United States or other regions could adversely affect our business. For example, the new administration under President Donald Trump has indicated that it may propose significant changes with respect to a variety of issues, including international trade agreements, import and export regulations, tariffs and customs duties, foreign relations, immigration laws, tax laws, corporate governance laws and corporate fuel economy standards, that could have a positive or negative impact on our business. The risks we face in our international operations may intensify if we further develop and expand our international operations.\nSignificant increases and fluctuations in raw materials pricing could materially harm us without proportionate recovery from our customers.\nSignificant increases in the cost of certain raw materials used in our products, such as aluminum, steel and magnesium ingot, or the cost of utility services required to produce our products, to the extent they are not timely reflected in the price we charge our customers or are otherwise mitigated, could materially and adversely impact our results. Prices for raw material inputs can be impacted by many factors, including developments in global commodities markets, international trade policies and developments in technology. The amount of steel available for processing is a function of the production levels of primary steel producers. The majority of our magnesium is sourced from China and could be subject to availability, trade policies, and price.\nWhile we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of raw material costs, there is no assurance that we will continue to do so, or that increases in raw material costs will not adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, significant increases in raw material prices may cause customers to redesign certain components or use alternative materials, which could result in reduced revenues, which could in turn harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe volatility of steel prices could materially harm our results of operations.\nA by-product of our production process is the generation of offal. We typically sell offal in secondary markets, which are similar to the steel markets. We generally share recoveries from sales of offal with our customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases in which we are participating in resale programs, or through product pricing, in cases in which we purchase steel directly from steel suppliers. In either situation, we may be affected by the fluctuation in scrap steel prices, either positively or negatively, in relation to our various customer agreements. As offal prices generally increase and decrease as steel prices increase and decrease, sales of offal may mitigate the impact of the volatility of steel price increases, as well as limit the benefits reaped from steel price declines. Any volatility in offal and steel prices could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDisruptions in the automotive supply chain could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe automotive supply chain is subject to disruptions because we, along with our customers and suppliers, attempt to maintain low inventory levels. Disruptions could result from a variety of situations, such as the closure of one of our or our suppliers\u2019 plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions or political upheaval. Disruptions could also result from logistical complications due to weather, earthquakes, or other natural or nuclear disasters, mechanical failures, technology disruptions or delayed customs processing.\nIf we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us. Any disruptions affecting us or caused by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLonger product lives of automotive parts may harm demand for some of our products.\nThe average useful life of automotive parts may increase due to innovations in products and technologies. As automotive product life cycles lengthen, opportunities to supply components for new programs may occur less frequently, which may reduce demand for some of our products.\nDiscontinuation of the vehicle models, engines or transmissions for which we manufacture products may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur typical sales contract provides for supplying a customer with our product requirements for particular programs, rather than manufacturing a specific quantity of components and systems. The initial terms of our sales contracts typically range from one to six years, with automatic renewal provisions that generally result in our contracts running for the life of the program. Our contracts do not require our customers to purchase a minimum number of components or systems. The loss of awarded business or significant reduction in demand for vehicles for which it produces components and systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe hourly workforce in our industry is highly unionized and our business could be harmed by labor disruptions.\nAs of October 31, 2017, approximately 17% of our U.S. hourly employees and 92% of our non-U.S. employees were unionized. Although we consider our current relations with our employees to be satisfactory, if major work disruptions were to occur, our business could be harmed by, for instance, a loss of revenues, increased costs or reduced profitability. We have not experienced a material labor disruption in our recent history, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material labor disruption at one of our facilities in the future in the course of renegotiation of our labor arrangements or otherwise.\nIn addition, many of the hourly employees of Fiat Chrysler Automotive and General Motors in North America and many of their other suppliers are unionized. Vehicle manufacturers, their suppliers and their respective employees in other countries are also subject to labor agreements. A work stoppage or strike at one of our production facilities, at those of a customer, or impacting a supplier of ours or any of our customers, such as the 2008 strike at a Tier 1 supplier that resulted in 30 General Motors facilities in North America being idled for several months, could have a material adverse impact on us by disrupting demand for our products and/or our ability to manufacture our products.\nWe may incur costs related to product warranties, legal proceedings and other claims, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we receive product warranty claims from our customers, pursuant to which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Vehicle manufacturers require their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and to be responsible for the operation of these component products in new vehicles sold to consumers. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field.\nWe vigorously defend ourselves in connection with all of the matters described above. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements. In future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably to us in amounts exceeding any reserves for such matters.\nProduct recalls by vehicle manufacturers could negatively impact our production levels, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, there have been significant product recalls by some of the world\u2019s largest vehicle manufacturers. Our risk to recalls of the products we manufacture is generally related to our workmanship on the product as opposed to the material and design of the products, as the design generally belongs to our customers and our parts are produced according to customer's specifications. Recalls, whether or not related to claims against us, may result in decreased vehicle production as a result of a manufacturer focusing its efforts on the problems underlying the recall rather than generating new sales volume. In addition, consumers may elect not to purchase vehicles manufactured by the vehicle manufacturer initiating the recall, or by vehicle manufacturers in general, while the recalls persist. We do not maintain insurance in North America for product recall matters, as such insurance is not generally available on acceptable terms. Any reduction in vehicle production volumes, especially by our OEM customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology and a failure of our information technology infrastructure or a breach of our information security could adversely impact our business and operations.\nOur operations rely on a number of information technologies to manage, store and support business activities. We have a number of systems, processes and practices in place that are designed to protect against the failure of our systems. We recognize the increasing volume of cyber-attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, however, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. Our systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information and production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or protected personal information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nChanges in privacy laws, regulations, and standards may cause our business to suffer.\nPersonal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe, and in many other jurisdictions where we offer our products. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Federal, state, or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws and regulations affecting data privacy. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with privacy and data securities laws, rules and regulations. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit our sales, and adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be harmed.\nWe own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and could be involved in licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position. Notwithstanding our intellectual property portfolio, our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Various patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws provide limited protection and may not prevent our competitors from duplicating our products or gaining access to our proprietary information. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them.\nOn occasion, we may assert claims against third parties who are taking actions that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third party intellectual property rights. These claims, regardless of their merit or resolution, are frequently costly to prosecute, defend or settle and divert the efforts and attention of our management and employees. Claims of this sort also could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any such claim were to result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to take actions which may include: expending significant resources to develop or license non-infringing products; paying substantial damages to third parties, including to customers to compensate them for their discontinued use or replacing infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or cessation of the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or our competitive position.\nWe are subject to risks associated with changing manufacturing technologies, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy requires us to continuously evolve our existing products and introduce new products to meet customers\u2019 needs. Our products are characterized by stringent performance and specification requirements that mandate a high degree of manufacturing and engineering expertise. If we fail to meet these requirements, our business could be at risk. We believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nproduct quality;\n\u2022\ntechnical expertise and development capability;\n\u2022\nnew product innovation;\n\u2022\nreliability and timeliness of delivery;\n\u2022\nprice competitiveness;\n\u2022\nproduct design capability;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing expertise;\n\u2022\noperational flexibility;\n\u2022\nglobal production capabilities;\n\u2022\ncustomer service; and\n\u2022\noverall management.\nOur success will depend on our ability to continue to meet our customers\u2019 changing specifications with respect to these criteria. We cannot assure you that we will be able to address technological advances or introduce new products that may be necessary to remain competitive within our businesses. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we can adequately protect any of our own technological developments to produce a sustainable competitive advantage.\nThe loss of our executive officers or key employees may materially harm operations and the ability to manage the day-to-day aspects of our business.\nOur future performance substantially depends on our ability to retain and motivate executive officers and key employees. Our ability to manage the day-to-day aspects of our business may be materially harmed with the loss of any of our executive officers or key employees, which have many years of experience with us and within the automotive industry and other manufacturing industries, or if we are unable to recruit qualified personnel. The loss of the services of one or more executive officers or key employees, who also have strong personal ties with customers and suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are involved from time to time in legal proceedings, claims or investigations, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are involved from time to time in legal proceedings, claims or investigations that could be significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of our business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental issues, tax matters and employment matters. No assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and the cost of complying, or our failure to comply with such requirements may materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment, the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous waste materials, or otherwise relating to the protection of public and employee health, safety and the environment. These laws and regulations expose us to liability for the environmental condition of our current facilities, and also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were not in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken or that resulted in contamination. These laws and regulations also may expose us to liability for claims of personal injury or property damage related to alleged exposure to hazardous or toxic materials. Despite our intentions to be in compliance with all such laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that we will at all times be in compliance with all such requirements. The cost of complying with these requirements may also increase substantially in future years. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. These requirements are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to maintain and comply with environmental permits that we are required to maintain could result in fines or penalties or other sanctions and have a material adverse effect on our operations or results. Future events, such as new environmental regulations or changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, newly discovered information or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our use of highly specialized machinery that cannot be easily replaced.\nOur machinery and tooling are complex, cannot be easily replicated and have a long lead-time to manufacture. If there is a breakdown in such machinery and tooling, and we or our service providers are unable to repair in a timely fashion, obtaining replacement machinery or rebuilding tooling could involve significant delays and costs, and may not be available to us on reasonable terms. Any disruption to our machinery could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImpairment charges relating to our goodwill or long lived assets could adversely affect our financial performance.\nGoodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Generally accepted accounting principles require that goodwill be periodically evaluated for impairment. As of October 31, 2017, we had $27,859 of goodwill, or 4.5% of our total assets, that could be subject to impairment. Declines in our profitability or the value of comparable companies may impact the fair value which could result in a write-down of goodwill and a reduction of net income. In addition, we have been required to recognize impairment charges for long lived assets. In accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of these assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our long lived assets. Any charges relating to impairments of goodwill or long lived assets may adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.\nMTD Holdings Inc. may exercise significant influence over us.\nMTD Holdings Inc. and its affiliates owned approximately 33.9% of our common stock as of October 31, 2017. As a result, MTD Holdings Inc. and its affiliates have significant influence over the vote in any election of directors and thereby its policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and its interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In addition, MTD Holdings Inc. may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to us or be opposed by other stockholders.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed U.S. tax reform legislation. Given this date of enactment, our financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2017 do not reflect the impact of this legislation. We are currently undergoing an analysis of the tax reform law and its impact to the financial statements and tax footnote disclosures. We are also evaluating if the tax reform law will impact the realizability of deferred tax assets and carryforwards. A more detailed analysis will be completed in our quarterly report for the period in which the law was enacted.\nCertain of our pension plans are underfunded and we have unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations. Additional cash contributions we may be required to make to our pension plans or amounts we may be required to pay in respect of post-retirement benefit obligations will reduce the cash available for our business.\nCertain of our employees in the United States are participants in defined benefit pension plans which we sponsor. As of October 31, 2017, the unfunded amount of our U.S. pension plans was approximately $19,848. While future benefit accruals under our U.S. defined benefit plans were frozen, we may have ongoing obligations to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans as required in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, we sponsor unfunded post-retirement benefits for a limited number of employees. As of October 31, 2017, the unfunded amount for these post-retirement benefits was approximately $313. Cash contributions to these plans and payment of these post-retirement benefit obligations will reduce the cash available for our business. Under ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\u201cPBGC\u201d) has the authority to petition a court to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under limited circumstances. In the event our pension plans are terminated by the PBGC, we could be liable to the PBGC for the entire amount of the underfunding, as calculated by the PBGC based on its own assumptions (which likely would result in a larger obligation than that based on the assumptions it has used to fund such plans).\nWe may incur material costs related to plant closings, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we must close manufacturing facilities because of lost business or consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the employee termination costs, asset retirements, and other exit costs associated with the closure of these facilities may be significant. In certain circumstances, we may close a manufacturing facility that is operated under a lease agreement and we may continue to incur material costs in accordance with the lease agreement. We attempt to align production capacity with demand; however, we cannot provide assurance that plants will not have to be closed.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may cause us to incur substantial expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may cause us to incur additional expenses and may make our supply chain more complex. In August 2012, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use certain minerals known as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d, which may or may not be mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, in their products. These requirements required due diligence efforts beginning in 2013, with initial disclosure requirements which began in 2014. There are significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements,\nincluding for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or remediate weaknesses could materially harm our revenues and trading price of the common stock. If we cannot accurately report financial results, stockholder confidence in our ability to pursue business and maintain the trading price of our common stock may be eroded.\nAn effective internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention or overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to reliable financial reporting and preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Because of its inherent internal control limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.\nIn the prior fiscal years, our management-directed testing of the control environment identified material weaknesses. Limited to specific manufacturing facilities, our management initiated and oversaw corrective actions remediating and improving the overall company-wide environment. As a consequence of the identified material weaknesses, we incurred unanticipated expenses and costs, including legal, consulting, and other professional fees, in connection with the respective remediation efforts.\nAs with inherent limitations, while we have established an effective control environment, future directed testing could potentially identify weaknesses. If remedial measures are insufficient to address potential material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control environment, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements. Potential corrective actions could include revision or restatement of our financial statements and would likely cause us to incur significant additional accounting, legal, consulting, and other professional fees and expenses. Further, those potential revisions and costs could expose us to potential claims or risks adversely affecting our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Lastly, matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial data on a timely basis, or to adjust previously issued financial data. These potential risks may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. Overall, these factors could precipitate a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements.", "PERMNO": 79307, "SIC": 3460, "TIC": "SHLOQ"}
