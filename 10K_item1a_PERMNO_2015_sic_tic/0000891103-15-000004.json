{"cik": "891103", "company": "IAC/INTERACTIVECORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\nThis annual report on Form 10-K contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of words such as \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans\u201d and \u201cbelieves,\u201d among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: IAC\u2019s future financial performance, IAC\u2019s business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which IAC\u2019s businesses operate and other similar matters. These forward-looking statements are based on IAC management's expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this annual report, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.\nActual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the risk factors set forth below. Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect IAC\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking statements discussed in this annual report may not prove to be accurate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which only reflect the views of IAC management as of the date of this annual report. IAC does not undertake to update these forward-looking statements.\nRisk Factors\nMr. Diller owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations.\nAs of January 30, 2015, Mr. Diller owned 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock representing 100% of IAC\u2019s outstanding Class B common stock and approximately 42.5% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC. As of this date, Mr. Diller also owned 930,734 vested options to purchase IAC common stock and 75,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock.\nIn addition, under an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC\u2019s Chairman and Senior Executive, he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC\u2019s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period. While Mr. Diller may not currently exercise this right, no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future, and if so, that Mr. Diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time, in which case IAC would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right.\nAs a result of Mr. Diller\u2019s ownership interest, voting power and the contractual rights described above, Mr. Diller currently is in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC\u2019s Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to IAC, which could adversely affect the market price of IAC securities.\nWe depend on our key personnel.\nOur future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success. Competition for well-qualified employees across IAC and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees. While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future. Effective succession planning is also important to our future success. If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses, our ability to execute short and long term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google that expires on March 31, 2016. Pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate paid listings provided by Google in response to search queries generated by users of our Search & Applications properties. In exchange for making our search traffic available to Google, we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us, as well as certain other search-related services.\nThe amount of revenue we receive from Google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount Google charges for advertisements, the efficiency of Google\u2019s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by Google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries. In addition, Google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to advertisers) of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our Search & Applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive. Google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to users) of paid listings from searches and these judgments factor into the amount of advertisements we can purchase. Changes to Google\u2019s paid listings network efficiency, its judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our Search & Applications properties, its judgment about the relative attractiveness to users of paid listings from searches or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made by Google.\nOur services agreement with Google requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google for the use of its brands and services, including the manner in which Google\u2019s paid listings are displayed within search results, and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings. Subject to certain limitations, Google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Noncompliance with Google\u2019s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our applications could, if not cured, result in Google\u2019s suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners, the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings or the termination of the services agreement by Google.\nThe termination of the services agreement by Google, the curtailment of IAC\u2019s rights under the agreement (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise) or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with Google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Google's ability to limit our ability to market our products and services through its advertising services, whether due to policy or competitive reasons or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate provider were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenues.\nGeneral economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to online advertising. Accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures. Advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending.\nSmall and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends, given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors, which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit. In the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising, particularly paid listings, as an effective alternative to traditional, offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the Internet.\nWe continue to compete with traditional advertising media, including television, radio and print, in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks, for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies continue to enter the online advertising market. We believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend, to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models (particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting and/or utilize mobile devices), the continued growth in commercial use of the Internet (particularly abroad), the extent to which web browsers, software programs and/or other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud. Any lack of growth in the market for online advertising, particularly for paid listings, or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to the passage of laws requiring additional disclosure, an industry-wide move to self-regulatory principles that require additional disclosure and/or opt-in policies for advertising that incorporate user targeting or other developments) would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend, in part, upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and distribute our products and services.\nWe engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers. How successful we are in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites, as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally.\nFor example, we have entered into (and expect to continue to enter into) agreements to distribute Search & Applications search boxes, toolbars and other applications to users through third parties. Most of these agreements are either non-exclusive and short-term in nature or, in the case of long-term or exclusive agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances. In addition, a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our B2B operations. Our inability to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute our search boxes, toolbars and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in website traffic, queries and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in the case of the businesses within The Match Group segment, we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our online personals websites. Pursuant to these arrangements, third parties generally promote our services on their websites or through e-mail campaigns and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to (or register with) our online personals websites or pay a percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription fees. These arrangements are generally not exclusive, are short-term in nature and are generally terminable by either party given notice. If existing arrangements with third parties are terminated (or are not renewed upon their expiration) and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues, or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with existing and/or new third parties in response to industry trends, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn the case of our HomeAdvisor business, our ability to drive traffic depends, in part, on the nature and number of home services professionals who are members of our network. While these home services professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions, we do not enter into long-term agreements with them generally and subscription memberships may be canceled at any time. In addition, a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses, which are particularly sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending. As a result, our network of home services professionals experiences turnover. This turnover, if significant or recurring over a prolonged period, could result in a decrease in traffic to HomeAdvisor.com and increased costs, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we succeed in driving traffic to our properties, we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality products and services. For example, in the case of About.com, we rely on independent, freelance subject matter experts to generate quality content for our users. If we fail to recruit and retain such experts generally and/or the experts ultimately retained cannot provide us with quality content in a cost-effective manner, the experience of our users would be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to adapt quickly and/or in a cost-effective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences, which can be difficult to predict, or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements and/or new products or services to the market. Our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences, which would result in decreases in users, customers and revenues and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs discussed below, our traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing, as well as for the development and introduction of new products, services and enhancements, infrastructure and other related efforts.\nMarketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or cost-effective.\nTraffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing. We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant expenditures for search engine marketing (primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords, which we purchase primarily through Google), online display advertising and traditional offline advertising in connection with these initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective. In the case of our search engine marketing efforts, our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines, as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising (which may be unilaterally updated by Google without advance notice), could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase and the related user experience, as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally, which would increase our costs and adversely impact the effectiveness of our advertising efforts overall. In the case of paid advertising generally, the policies of sellers and publishers of advertising (including Google) may limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOne of the most cost-effective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new (and retain existing) users and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization, or SEO. SEO involves developing websites to rank well within search engine results. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of search results. The failure to successfully manage SEO efforts across our businesses, including the timely modification of SEO efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms, search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results (which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results), could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, search engines continue to expand their offerings into other, non-search related categories, and in certain instances display their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search results. Continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLastly, as discussed above, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts. If we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.\nAny failure to attract and acquire new (and retain existing) traffic, users and customers in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to build, maintain and/or enhance our various brands.\nThrough our various businesses, we own and operate a number of highly-recognizable brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries, as well as a number of fledgling brands that we are in the process of building. We believe that our success depends, in part, upon our continuing ability to maintain and enhance our established brands, as well as build awareness of (and loyalty to) our fledgling brands. Our brands and brand-building efforts could be negatively impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including product and service quality concerns, consumer complaints, actions brought by consumers, governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches. Moreover, the failure to market our products and services successfully (or in a cost-effective manner), the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers and/or the inability to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost effective manner) to evolving changes in the Internet and related technologies, applications and devices, could adversely impact our various brands and brand-building efforts, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Internet and related technologies and applications continue to evolve and we may not be able to adapt to these changes.\nThe development of new products and services in response to the evolving trends and technologies of the Internet, as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment, require significant time and resources. We may not be able to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost-effective manner) to these changes, appropriately time the introduction of new products and services to the market or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner. Also, these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites, applications, services and proprietary technologies obsolete. Our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately (and/or in a cost effective manner) could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the case of certain of our applications, third parties have introduced (and continue to introduce) new or updated technologies and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize our applications generally or otherwise make users less likely to use our services (such as through the introduction of features and/or processes that disproportionately and adversely impact the ability of consumers to access and use our services relative to those of our competitors). For example, third parties continue to introduce technologies (including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems) that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed and/or have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use. In addition, there are technologies that interfere with the functionality of (or settings changes made by) our applications. For example, there are technologies that interfere with search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and web browser search settings previously selected by our users. These technologies, applications and policies adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our applications, which in turn adversely impacts our revenues. Technologies have also been introduced that can block the display of advertisements on web pages and that provide users with the ability to opt out of advertising products. Our failure to successfully modify our toolbars and other applications in a cost-effective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services. While many of our users continue to access our products and services through personal computers, users of (and usage volumes on) mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, continue to increase relative to those of personal computers. While we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services (and have developed certain products and services exclusively for mobile devices) and intend to continue to do so in the future, we may not be able to monetize these applications as effectively as we monetize our non-mobile products and services. In addition, the success of our mobile applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and, in turn, our ability to attract advertisers. Lastly, as the adoption of mobile devices becomes more widespread, we will need to take steps to ensure that our products and services are attractive to users of mobile devices. This shift could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to replace the related revenues.\nThe processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nWe receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data (including personal credit card data, as well as private content (such as videos and correspondence)) in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online products and services, transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites. The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses. These policies are, in turn, subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices, regarding privacy generally and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal information and user data. Examples include the European Union Data Protection Directive (as adopted and implemented by the various European Union member states, the \"EU Directive\"), various U.S. state regulations concerning minimum data\nsecurity standards, industry self-regulating principles that have become standard practice and more stringent contractual protections (and related compliance obligations) regarding privacy and data security.\nIn addition, if an online service provider fails to comply with its privacy policy, it could become subject to an investigation and/or proceeding for unfair or deceptive practices brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act (and/or brought by a state attorney general pursuant to a similar state law), as well as a private lawsuit under various U.S. federal and state laws. Similarly, in the European Union, the online service provider could become subject to an investigation and/or proceeding for the violation of the data protection laws and regulations brought by a member state or its supervisory authority (an independent body charged with monitoring compliance with data protection laws), as well as private causes of action under the EU Directive. In general, personal information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world (particularly in the European Union), the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.\nU.S. and foreign legislators and regulators may enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security. For example, in May 2014, the White House released a review of \"big data\" practices, which called for an update to U.S. privacy laws based on the proposed Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights released by the White House in February 2012 and the enactment of a federal data breach notification law. In addition, in February 2013 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a report seeking changes in Internet and mobile privacy protection and disclosures. Similarly, new privacy laws and regulations at the state level, as well as new laws and directives abroad (particularly in the European Union), are being proposed and implemented. For example, legislation in the state of California that became effective on January 1, 2014 requires companies that collect personal information to disclose how they respond to web browser \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals and the European Union is in the process of adopting new guidelines for data protection and privacy to address recent globalization and technological developments, which will supersede the EU Directive. In addition, existing privacy laws that were intended for brick-and-mortar businesses could be interpreted in a manner that would extend their reach to our businesses. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws) in this area may make it more costly to operate our businesses and/or limit our ability to engage in certain types of activities, such as targeted advertising, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses. Also, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches. In the case of security breaches involving personal credit card data, credit card companies could curtail our ability to transact payments and impose fines for failure to comply with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. Moreover, any such breach could decrease consumer confidence in the case of the business that experienced the breach or our businesses generally, which would decrease traffic to (and in turn, usage and transactions on) the relevant website and/or our various websites and which in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The failure of any of our businesses, or their various third party vendors and service providers, to comply with applicable privacy policies, federal, state or foreign privacy laws and regulations or PCI standards, as well as the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data for any reason, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our systems, infrastructures and technologies from cyber attacks. In addition, we may be adversely impacted by cyber attacks experienced by third parties. Any disruption of our systems, infrastructures and technologies, or compromise of our user data or other information, due to cyber attacks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyber attacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks or other malicious activities (or any combination of these events) is on the rise worldwide. From time to time, we may become the victim of these types of attacks.\nWhile we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses, these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that these events will not occur in the future and if they do occur, will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we may become the victim of security breaches, such as the misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of user, customer or vendor data maintained in our information technology systems or those of third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations).\nAny cyber attack or security breach we experience could prevent us from providing our products and services, damage our reputation, erode our brands and/or be costly to remedy, as well as result in a degradation of our products and services and/or cause damage to our systems, infrastructures, technologies and data. Even if we do not experience such events, the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations) could have a similar effect. Moreover, even cyber attacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in a loss of consumer confidence generally, which could make consumers and users less likely to use our products and services.\nIn addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we are able to do so, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions. In addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value.\nWe have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities, as well as maximize our existing assets. As a result, our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisition-related efforts.\nEven if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions, and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate the operations, as well as the accounting, financial controls, management information, technology, human resources and other administrative systems, of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully identify and realize potential synergies among acquired and existing businesses;\n\u2022\nretain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully manage acquisition-related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of IAC and its businesses and/or acquired businesses.\nWe may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions. In addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities. Also, the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges. The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in various international markets, some in which we have limited experience. As a result, we face additional risks in connection with our international operations. Also, we may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into our existing, international markets.\nWe currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence. In order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the Internet must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the United States. Moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks. For example, we may experience difficulties in managing international operations due to distance, language and cultural differences and political and/or economic instability, including issues associated with establishing and maintaining effective management systems and infrastructures (including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting), the staffing of foreign operations, exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information. Our success in international markets will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint\nventure or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own.\nA variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies. Some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value-added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged. Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Laws that do reference the Internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain.\nFor example, through our various businesses we post and link to third party content, including third party advertisements, links and websites. We also allow users to submit content, such as comments, photographs and videos. We could be subject to liability for posting, hosting or linking to third party content, and while we generally require third parties to indemnify us for related claims, we may not be able to enforce our indemnification rights. Some laws, including the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, limit our liability for posting or linking to third party content. For example, the DMCA generally protects online service providers from claims of copyright infringement based on the storage of third party content at the direction of the user, so long as certain statutory requirements are satisfied. However, the scope and applicability of the DMCA are subject to judicial interpretation and, as such, remain uncertain, and the U.S. Congress may enact legislation affecting (and potentially limiting) the protections afforded by the DMCA to online service providers. Moreover, similar protections may not exist in other jurisdictions in which our various businesses operate. As a result, claims have been, and could be, threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign laws based upon use of third party content asserting, among other things, negligence, defamation, invasion of privacy or right or publicity, copyright infringement or trademark infringement.\nAlso, we send electronic messages to users through our various businesses, as well as develop, market and/or distribute a variety of downloadable applications through our B2C and B2B operations, which could subject us to liability for failing to comply with laws governing the sending of electronic messages to our users and the installation of downloadable applications. For example, Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Legislation (\u201cCASL\u201d), which became effective on July 1, 2014, prohibits all commercial electronic messages (including e-mail, text, social media, sound and image messages) that are sent without proper consumer consent. And, effective January 15, 2015, the CASL restricts the unsolicited installation of computer programs and applications. While several Canadian regulators are jointly empowered to enforce and issue administrative and monetary penalties for CASL violations, effective July 1, 2017 individuals may also file private and class action lawsuits to collect statutory damages for CASL violations.\nIn addition, changing Internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention. One example of such changing practices is the increasing use of \u201cnative\u201d advertising, a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as similar to traditional editorial content. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has indicated that it will continue to monitor the use of online native advertising to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive to consumers.\nAny failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers. Specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities. While we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us. Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe regard our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, patents, copyrights and other similar intellectual property, as critical to our success. For example, the businesses within certain of our reporting segments (Search & Applications, The Match Group and eCommerce) rely heavily upon their trademarks (primarily Ask.com,\nAbout.com, Dictionary.com, Investopedia, PriceRunner, Ask.fm, our various toolbar brands, SlimWare, Match.com, OkCupid.com, OurTime.com, Meetic.com, HomeAdvisor.com and ShoeBuy.com and related domain names and logos), through which they market their products and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition. So long as these businesses continue to police unauthorized use of these trademarks and take action against infringement, use these trademarks to identify their products and services and timely renew trademark and related domain name registrations as required, they should continue to enjoy trademark protection indefinitely under current laws, rules and regulations.\nThe businesses within our Search & Applications segment also rely upon trade secrets, including algorithms for the generation, organization and presentation of search results. To a lesser extent, these businesses also rely upon patented and patent-pending proprietary technologies and processes, primarily those relating to search-related products and services, with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2033, and copyrighted material, primarily software and content, such as emoticons, characters and other content that is incorporated into (and used in connection with the marketing of) toolbars and applications generally.\nThe Match Group segment also relies upon trade secrets and patented (with expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2034) and patent-pending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features, products and services. HomeAdvisor relies heavily upon trade secrets, primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of home services professionals are matched with consumers, as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020.\nWe rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights. For example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate. Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.\nWe also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future. No assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed (or will file) will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies. In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.\nDespite these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization. The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the Internet using our various domain names, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.\nOur success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties. System interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business.\nTo succeed, our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis. From time to time, we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services. Moreover, as traffic to our websites, applications and online properties increases and the number of new (and presumably more complex) products and services that we introduce continues to grow, we will need to upgrade our systems, infrastructures and technologies generally to facilitate this growth. If we fail to do so, users, customers and third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our products and services on an intermittent or\nprolonged basis, which could adversely affect the quality of their experiences. In addition, we could experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, which could have the same effect. Moreover, even if we do not experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations) may not make the changes to their systems, infrastructures and technologies needed to access our products and services on a timely basis, if at all. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also rely on third party computer systems, data centers, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and/or process certain transactions with users and customers. Furthermore, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, broadband or other communications systems at any time. Any event of this nature could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers. While we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.\nIf any of these events were to occur, it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy.\nOur estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous jurisdictions abroad. Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation. Our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions. Although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree. The ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 78840, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MTCH"}
