RISK FACTORS\nRisks relating to our Business\nThe timeline for commercial sales of new products, the profit margins that new products can command and customer acceptance of new products, are all key to our success and all are unpredictable.\nWe plan to create new products using our intellectual property. To implement this plan, we must identify products that can benefit from our intellectual property, take the products from concept to prototype, and make and sell the new product commercially. Many factors affect a customer\u2019s acceptance of new products and many new product ideas are never realized. Many others never achieve commercial success. If we cannot develop and commercialize new products it will adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue as a going concern if we do not successfully raise additional capital.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings, as well as obtain credit from vendors to be able to fully execute our business plan. If we are unable to successfully raise the capital we need, we may need to reduce the scope of our business to fully satisfy our future short-term liquidity requirements. If we cannot raise additional capital or reduce the scope of our business, we may be otherwise unable to achieve our goals or continue our operations. While we believe that we will be able to adjust our operations or raise the capital we need to continue our operations, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts or will be able to resolve our liquidity issues or eliminate our operating losses. In addition, any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute your ownership interest. We may not be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funds or credit from our vendors, we will be unable to execute our business plan and you could lose your investment.\nOur strategy to commercialize new products from our intellectual property may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, any of which could adversely affect our results and negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nFew companies have been able to develop commercial products based on nanotechnology. Nanofilm, our subsidiary, under the leadership of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Rickert, has been successful with products of limited scope. Identifying new products that can be manufactured, marketed and sold at margins that justify the investment and then taking those products to market will take time. If we cannot successfully develop and sell products enhanced by nanotechnology, or if the process drags on, the value of PEN common stock may be affected adversely.\nThe failure to manage successfully our existing businesses while new products are under development until they can generate commercial sales may adversely affect our future results.\nOur management team must continue to manage current operations to give us time to accomplish our growth plans. At the same time, we must fund product development, create or contract for manufacturing capability, and establish sales, marketing and distribution for the new products. Disruptions or the failure to address changes in our current businesses could adversely affect ours results, financial condition and stock price.\nOur increased focus on commercializing products from our intellectual property library may affect our ability to attract funding for private research as we may be perceived as a potential competitor. At the same time, to support our research staff we need sufficient research projects to pay the expenses of the research segment and related salaries. The inability to obtain research funding could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have limited resources.\nWe are a small company with limited human and financial resources. Most of our competitors are larger than us with greater financial strength. Our limited resources will require that we limit the potential new products that we work on at any time and may limit our ability to tackle issues that arise in development, manufacturing, regulatory approvals or marketing. Our limited resources and potential constraints on our ability to take advantage of opportunities, may give competitors time to challenge our products in the marketplace and to bring pressure on us by devoting more resources to marketing and distribution that may make it harder for us to be successful with new products.\nNew products directed at new market sectors or to consumers are expected to require expenditures for sales and marketing greater than revenues from sales of new products. Some new products may also require patent protection in order to protect our technology and patent protection requires significant up-front cost before the marketplace success of the product can be known. To fund these expenses we will require additional financing and our results of operations and the value of our stock may be adversely affected if we cannot obtain additional funding when needed or on reasonable terms. In addition, delay in obtaining financing may adversely affect acceptance of the new products and may afford competitors the opportunity to respond or challenge our products that may also adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business plan contemplates the acquisition of businesses that have distribution channels and who know the customers for our new products to help us with marketing, sales and distribution, but our ability to negotiate those deals, the time required to close the deals, and the costs to accomplish these acquisitions are unknown.\nTo understand the potential market for new products, to better understand target customers, and to augment our resources to market and distribute new products, we expect to identify businesses that are already knowledgeable about the marketing, sales and distribution to target customers to accelerate sales of new products. Identifying those companies, negotiating the acquisition and integrating new personnel into the product development team must all happen for PEN\u2019s new products to benefit from these acquisitions. If we cannot identify, or cannot successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition of a product company, our ability to implement our business plan will be delayed either until an acquisition can be identified and consummated, until we can obtain the funding to create and grow our own marketing and distribution, or until a different product opportunity is identified where such an acquisition can be accomplished.\nOur marketing and acquisition strategy is expected to require additional capital, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent it from growing.\nTo fund acquisitions of product companies, to acquire technology to complete the development of new products, or to pay for sales and marketing of new products, PEN expects that it will be required to raise capital through public or private financings. If financing is not available on acceptable terms, or at all, PEN\u2019s failure to raise capital when needed could harm its business. Moreover, because there will not be earnings from new products for some period of time, financings are expected to be equity financings that will dilute the holders of PEN common stock.\nOur executive team has not previously worked together to lead a public company, and any inability of members of the executive team to work together effectively or the loss of any of them could adversely affect its performance.\nWhile the executive officers have significant experience, some do not have any experience working for a public company, and they have not worked together. None of the executives has experience as a manager of a public holding company with several operating subsidiaries. Moreover, our acquisition strategy will also mean that new key players will be expected to join the management team to accomplish the development, marketing, sales and distribution of new products. Our success will depend, in part, on the ability of our executives to work effectively as a team in this new environment. Any inability of our executive team to work together effectively or the loss of any of them, could impair PEN\u2019s ability to execute its strategy.\nPEN is disadvantaged by its relatively small size in selling into the optical industry, and its size also limits its ability to introduce its existing products to customers outside the optical industry.\nPEN is smaller in size than other companies that sell products into the optical industry. Larger companies may have a broader product line to offer customers and have the resources to put products into more distribution channels than we have the resources to pursue. Our size also means we has fewer resources to hire people to pursue sales and marketing opportunities for products to those and to other customers which inhibits our growth.\nSales to industrial customers that incorporate PEN products into their own product offerings make us dependent on our industrial customer\u2019s commitment and on its success.\nSome of our existing products are, and potential new products may also be, sold to industrial customers that incorporate our product into their own products for their customers. This means the success of our product is dependent on the level of support, marketing and customer assistance provided by our industrial customer, and we cannot control timing, marketing or introduction of our products or improved products, the timing or methods used to address customer concerns, and we cannot directly affect marketing or distribution of the products or services that incorporate our products. If our industrial customer has other priorities or is unsuccessful in its marketing or its customer service, the sales of our products and our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nTerms of secured debt make PEN vulnerable if operational issues adversely impact its working capital.\nNanofilm redeemed a majority in number of its members in 2012 and took on secured debt in 2013 to pay notes issued to some former members in the redemption. That debt was refinanced in April 2014. PEN must comply with the terms of the debt agreements in order to borrow for its regular working capital needs. Customer decisions to delay shipments, disruption in the supply chain or other operating difficulties that increase the inventory on hand or that delay collection of accounts receivable could mean that the lender will no longer advance funds and PEN could need different terms from its lender or might need to curtail its business.\nPEN\u2019s products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may subject it to claims, or prevent or delay its product development efforts and stop it from selling or increase the costs of its products.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. If claims are made that we are using third party technology without authorization or that any third-party patents cover our products or their use, the holders of any of these patents or other intellectual property may be able to block the sale of our products unless we obtain a license or changes the products so as not to use the third-party\u2019s intellectual property. We could incur significant costs defending against any claim, and, if we is liable, we may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or redesign the products at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nPEN relies on trade secrets to protect its proprietary know-how and technology, especially where PEN does not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Others may independently develop the same or similar technology, or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary technology. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information and to develop products that better compete with our products.\nAny lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights necessary to defend PEN or enforce its rights will be costly and time consuming.\nOur ability to defend our intellectual property may require litigation to enforce our rights or to defend litigation brought by a third-party. Any of these lawsuits, regardless of their success, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and resolve and may require delay or suspension of commercial sales while they are pending. The cost could cause us to forego litigation or to settle on terms that are disadvantageous. If litigation is undertaken or defended, that attendant cost or delay could have a material, adverse impact on PEN\u2019s results of operations.\nWe have limited experience in sales and marketing and may be unable to successfully commercialize new products, and it will take time and may be difficult to build brand loyalty.\nOur marketing, sales and distribution experience and capabilities are limited. Our ability to achieve success with new products depends on successfully marketing products and attracting customers and building brand loyalty. To successfully perform sales, marketing, distribution and customer support functions we have strengthened our management team and plan to make strategic acquisitions, but if we cannot accomplish that, may be forced to endeavor to accomplish this ourselves. If that occurs, we will face a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf The time and cost of creating a sales and marketing team and sales force;\n\u25cf The time and cost of creating a sales and marketing program for a new product;\n\u25cf The risk that competitors react to challenge new products that we introduce with increased sales and marketing, promotions and advertising;\n\u25cf The time and cost to identify and convince customers to purchase a new product; and\n\u25cf The time and cost to create brand awareness and loyalty for new products.\nEven if we are successful in acquiring a product company with relevant sales, marketing and distribution capability, the expertise will need to be applied to our products, and methods may need to be changed to be successful with our products.\nSome of our technology development is in its early stages and the viability of commercial products is uncertain\nSome of our applications of our intellectual property, and certain products that use these technologies, will require significant additional development, engineering, testing and investment prior to commercialization. We are exploring the use of our technology in several different types of products. We have developed proof of concepts of potential products based on some of our technologies, others are not that far in the process. It is uncertain whether commercially viable products can be developed from a number of our technologies, the size of the potential customer base, and the resources that will be required to develop, test, standardize, manufacture, market, distribute and sell these potential products. Evaluating the potential commercial uses of a product under development is a matter of judgment, and mistakes would reduce the resources available for other potential products and delay commercialization which would adversely affect our results of operations and may require us to seek additional capital that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur development partners have certain rights to jointly developed property and to license our technology.\nIn several cases involving our sensor technologies, we have committed to license our technology to our development partners in designated fields of use upon completion of certain development projects that are in process. Whether we can be the development partner, and the terms of these licenses have not yet been finalized. Our development partners usually also have rights to jointly developed intellectual property; however, any such jointly developed property would likely be based, at least in part, on our underlying technology which would require our partners to enter into a license agreement with us.\nSome health effects of nanotechnology are unknown.\nThere is scientific debate on the health effects of nanomaterials, but some scientists believe that certain nanomaterials may be hazardous to human health or the environment. The science of nanotechnology is engineering at the molecular level to modify or build materials. Many nano-materials are found in nature, others are not naturally occurring. The health effect of new materials is unknown, and can depend on how they are incorporated and bonded to other materials. We carefully evaluate potential health effects of our products on our customers and the effects of handling materials on our employees and those who manufacture for us. We are very mindful of the risks of materials we use and focus on health and safety. However, the ongoing debate about the health effects of nanoparticles and nanotechnology and increasing government regulation for some nano materials may adversely affect market acceptance of our products and adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThere has been little trading of our common stock, and an active trading market for our common stock may not develop.\nAlthough our Class A common stock is listed on the OTCQB; volume has been small. An active trading market for shares of our common stock may never develop or be sustained. If no trading market develops, securities analysts may not initiate or maintain research coverage of our company, which could further depress the market for our common stock. As a result, investors may not be able to sell their shares of our common stock at the time that they would like to sell. The limited market for our shares may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional shares and our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our common stock as consideration.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for investors and subject us to securities class action litigation.\nIf an active market for our stock develops and continues, our stock price nevertheless may be volatile. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, including:\n\u25cf Fluctuation in our quarterly operating results or the operating results of our competitors;\n\u25cf Changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf Variance in our financial performance from the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u25cf Changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\n\u25cf Changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results;\n\u25cf Failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success;\n\u25cf Conditions and trends in the markets we serve\n\u25cf Changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u25cf Success of competitive products and services;\n\u25cf Changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u25cf Changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u25cf Announcements of significant new products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf Changes in legislation or regulatory policies, practices, or actions;\n\u25cf The commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u25cf Recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf Changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u25cf Actual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders; and\n\u25cf The trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, the OTCQB and the market for nanotechnology companies in particular, may experience a loss of investor confidence. Such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class action litigation. Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe liquidity of the trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. At present, no analysts follow our stock. If that should change, the price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nPEN does not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends. As a result, stockholders can expect to receive a return on our Class A common stock only if the market price of the stock increases.\nOur Chairman and CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock.\nScott Rickert, our Chairman and CEO has the power to vote all the Class B common stock of PEN, representing approximately 46% of the outstanding PEN common stock and approximately 99% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Rickert has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to PEN stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Under the terms of the Rickert Family, Limited Partnership, at the time of his death, control will transfer to his wife Jeanne Rickert. As a board member and officer, Mr. Rickert owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Rickert is entitled to vote as the general partner of Rickert Family, Limited Partnership in the interest of the Rickert family, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nCertain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws will:\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior stockholder approval, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u25cf limit the persons who can call special stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf permit written action by voting stockholders, permitting Scott Rickert acting alone to accomplish most stockholder actions;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements to nominate persons for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u25cf provide for the filling of vacancies on our board of directors by action of a majority of the directors and not by the stockholders.\nThese and other provisions in our organizational documents could allow our board of directors to affect your rights as a stockholder in a number of ways, including making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for approving the appointment of members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace the current management team. These provisions could also limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our share price.\nSales of substantial shares of our common stock in the public market following a capital raise, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur common stock has in the past been a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC rules and it may be more difficult to resell securities classified as \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nIn the past, our common stock was a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under applicable SEC rules (generally defined as non-exchange traded stock with a per-share price below $5.00). Unless we maintain a per-share price above $5.00, these rules impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as \u201cestablished customers\u201d or \u201caccredited investors.\u201d The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may also affect your ability to resell our common stock.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT\nThis document contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
