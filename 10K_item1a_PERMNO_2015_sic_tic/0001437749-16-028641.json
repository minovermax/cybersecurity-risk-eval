Risk Factors\nGyrodyne\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks customary for real property owners, as well as additional risks associated with Gyrodyne\u2019s business plan of opportunistically seeking the sale of its properties, some of which may be the subject of value enhancement efforts. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm the value of our properties and the magnitude of distributions to our shareholders, including causing Gyrodyne\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following summary of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Gyrodyne or that Gyrodyne currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods. For more information about forward-looking statements, see the section of this report entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information\u201d below.\nRisks incidental to real estate ownership and management\nBecause our business plan is to pursue the opportunistic disposition of our properties, we do not expect to make any further investments other than to enhance the values of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties which may include acquisitions of land and/or executing land swaps. Accordingly, an investment in Gyrodyne depends upon the financial performance and the value of our current portfolio of properties, which properties are subject to the risks normally associated with the ownership and management of real properties, including:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in general and local economic conditions which affect the demand for real estate assets;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other properties;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022\nreduced availability of financing;\n\u2022\nthe cyclical nature of the real estate industry and possible oversupply of, or reduced demand for, properties in the markets in which our investments are located;\n\u2022\nthe attractiveness of our properties to tenants and purchasers;\n\u2022\nhow well we manage our properties;\n\u2022\nchanges in market rental rates and our ability to rent space on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of our tenants and borrowers including their becoming insolvent and bankrupt;\n\u2022\nthe need to periodically renovate, repair and re-lease space and the costs thereof; and\n\u2022\nincreases in maintenance, insurance and operating costs.\nThere are risks associated with seeking to enhance the value of certain properties\nGyrodyne is currently exploring enhancements of the value of our Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties by pursuing various development, redevelopment and/or zoning opportunities. The Board believes that the cost of doing so will be exceeded by the resulting increase in value in such properties. Our efforts to seek enhancements of such properties are subject to various risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nany delay or denial of a required entitlement or permit, including zoning, land use, environmental, emissions or other related permits, would adversely impact our property enhancement plans;\n\u25cf\nour analysis of site context, of demographic trends, of decisions of anchor institutions and of growth opportunities generally may not result in identifying the correct high value land uses and programmatic synergies;\n\u25cf\ncapital improvement costs and other expenses of such enhancements may be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable;\n\u25cf\nwe may not have funds available or be able to obtain financing for these value-enhancement projects on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf\nwe may experience delays in the repositioning or improvement process.\nFor these and other reasons, we cannot assure you that we will realize growth in the value of our Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, and as a result our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure you of the exact timing and amount of any further distributions to our shareholders\nOur estimate of net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2015 is $43.5 million or $29.31 per common share. These estimated amounts are based on a number of estimates, assumptions and factors outside of our control. The process of disposing our real property assets in an orderly manner designed to obtain the best value reasonably available for such assets may fail to create value or may result in lower than expected value and may result in lower than expected proceeds, or in no proceeds, for distribution to our shareholders. The actual nature, amount and timing of all distributions will be determined by Gyrodyne in our sole discretion, and will depend on, and could be delayed by, among other things, sales of our real estate assets, claim settlements with creditors, resolution of outstanding litigation matters, payment of incentive bonuses to employees, directors, former employees and a former director who were vested under the Incentive Compensation Plan and unanticipated or greater-than-expected expenses. Examples of uncertainties that could reduce the value of or eliminate distributions to our shareholders include unanticipated costs relating to:\n\u25cf\nfailure to achieve favorable values for our properties in their disposition;\n\u25cf\nthe defense, satisfaction or settlement of lawsuits or other claims that may be made or threatened against us in the future; and\n\u25cf\ndelay or failure to settle claims.\nAs a result, we cannot determine with certainty the amount or timing of distributions to our shareholders or to holders of Gyrodyne, LLC shares.\nIf we are unable to find buyers for our properties at our expected sales prices, distributions may be delayed or reduced.\nIn calculating our estimated net assets in liquidation, we assumed that we will be able to find buyers for all of our properties at our estimated amounts. However, we may have overestimated the sales prices that we will be able to obtain for these properties or underestimated the costs associated with such sales. If we are not able to find buyers for these properties in a reasonably timely manner or if we have overestimated the sales prices we will receive, distributions payable to holders of our common shares would be delayed or reduced. Furthermore, our estimated net assets in liquidation is based on current market conditions, but real estate market values are constantly changing and tend to fluctuate with changes in interest rates, supply and demand dynamics, occupancy percentages, lease rates, the availability of suitable buyers, the perceived quality and dependability of income flows from tenancies and a number of other factors, both local and national. In addition, transactional fees and expenses, environmental contamination at our properties or unknown liabilities, if any, may adversely impact the net liquidation proceeds from those properties.\nDistributions to shareholders may be delayed or reduced as a result of sale agreement provisions that allow purchasers to terminate agreements and/or result in purchaser defaults\nAs previously reported, we (through wholly-owned subsidiaries) entered into purchase and sale agreements for the sale of our Fairfax Medical Center and a building in our Port Jefferson Professional Park (in addition to two buildings in the Park that have already been sold). These purchase and sale agreements contain provisions that give the purchaser the right to terminate the agreement, for any reason or no reason, prior to the expiration of an evaluation period, and have the right to receive a refund of earnest money deposits. It is anticipated that future sales agreements will have similar provisions. The consummation of these sales and other potential sales for which we will enter into sale agreements in the future will also be subject to satisfaction of standard closing conditions. If any property sale contemplated by these or future sale agreements does not close because a purchaser exercises its termination right or defaults, or because of a failure of a closing condition or for any other reason, we will need to locate a new buyer for the property, which we may be unable to do promptly or at a price or on terms that is as favorable as the original sale agreement. We will also incur additional costs involved in negotiating a new sale agreement for this property. These additional costs are not included in our projections. In the event that we incur these additional costs, distributions to our shareholders would be delayed or reduced.\nIf our transaction costs or unpaid liabilities are greater than we expect, distributions may be delayed or reduced.\nAfter we complete the opportunistic disposition of all of our real properties, some of which may be the subject of enhancement efforts, we will apply the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any claims against Gyrodyne and then to make liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. Before making liquidating distributions on our common shares, we will need to pay or arrange for the payment of all of our transaction costs incurred in opportunistic sales of our properties, including enhancements of certain properties, and all valid claims of our creditors, including obligations under our Retention Bonus Plan. The Board may also decide to acquire one or more insurance policies covering unknown or contingent claims against Gyrodyne or our directors, for which we would pay a premium which has not yet been determined. The Board may also decide to establish a reserve fund to pay these contingent claims. The amounts of transaction costs incurred in opportunistic sales of our properties, including enhancements, are not yet final, so we have used estimates of these costs in calculating our estimated net assets in liquidation. To the extent that we have underestimated these costs in calculating our projections or we incur unforeseen additional costs, our actual liquidating distributions may be lower than our estimated net assets in liquidation. In addition, if the claims of our creditors are greater than we have anticipated or we decide to acquire one or more insurance policies covering unknown or contingent claims against us, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced. Further, if a reserve fund is established, payment of liquidating distributions to our holders of common shares may be delayed or reduced.\nWe may not be able to settle all of our obligations to creditors at the amount we have estimated.\nWe have current and expect to incur future obligations to creditors. Any estimated distributions to shareholders would take into account all of our known obligations and our best estimate of the amount reasonably required to satisfy such obligations. As part of the wind-down process, we will attempt to settle those obligations with our creditors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to settle all of these obligations for the amount we have estimated for purposes of calculating the likely distribution to shareholders. If we are unable to reach an agreement with a creditor relating to an obligation, that creditor may bring a lawsuit against us. Amounts required to settle obligations or defend lawsuits in excess of the amounts estimated by us will reduce the amount of remaining proceeds available for distribution to shareholders.\nOur shareholders may be liable to our creditors for an amount up to the amount distributed by us if our reserves for payments to creditors are inadequate.\nIn the event our shareholders receive distributions from Gyrodyne, LLC and there are insufficient funds to pay any creditors who seek payment of claims against Gyrodyne, shareholders could be held liable for payments made to them and could be required to return all or a part of distributions made to them.\nWe may be unable to sell our interest in the Grove\nThe Company owns a 10.12% limited partnership interest in Callery Judge Grove, L.P. (the \u201cGrove\u201d), a limited partnership which in 2013 sold its only asset, an undeveloped Florida property. Under the agreement with the purchaser, the Grove may receive additional payments if certain development benchmarks are achieved by the purchaser. The Company cannot predict whether these benchmarks will be achieved or as to the timing or amount of any further distributions by the Grove. Pursuant to the terms of the Grove\u2019s limited partnership agreement, the consent of the managing partner is required for the sale of our limited partnership interest. If we are unable to obtain the managing partner\u2019s consent we may have difficulty in timely selling our limited partnership interest or in selling it at all, which could reduce and/or delay our liquidating distributions.\nOur properties may subject us to known and unknown liabilities.\nOur existing properties may have known and unknown liabilities for which we would have no recourse, or only limited recourse, to the former owners of such properties. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of an acquired property, we might be required to pay significant sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our financial results, cash flow and proceeds available for distribution. Unknown liabilities relating to acquired properties could include:\n\u2022\nliabilities for clean-up of pre-existing disclosed or undisclosed environmental contamination;\n\u2022\nclaims by tenants, vendors or other persons arising on account of actions or omissions of the former owners of the properties; and\n\u2022\nliabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.\nIf we are unable to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and lease currently available space, if tenants default under their leases or other obligations to us or if our cash flow is otherwise less than we expect, distributions to our shareholders may be delayed or reduced.\nThe sales proceeds that could be generated from opportunistic dispositions of our real properties depend in large part on occupancy and rental rates, our success in renting currently available space and the existence of any significant tenant defaults that were not subsequently cured. Negative trends in one or more of these factors may adversely affect the resale value of the properties, which would reduce our distributions. Disposition proceeds and related distributions will be reduced to the extent that we receive less rental income than we expect. We may also decide in the event of a tenant default to restructure the lease, which could require us to substantially reduce the rent payable to us under the lease, or make other modifications that are unfavorable to us.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the financial condition of our tenants.\nOur tenants may experience a downturn in their business resulting in their inability to make rental payments when due. In addition, a tenant may seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant\u2019s lease and cause a reduction in our cash flow. We cannot evict a tenant solely because of its filing for bankruptcy. A bankruptcy court, however, may authorize a tenant to reject and terminate its lease. In such a case, our claim against the tenant for past due rent and unpaid future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent owed under the lease. In any event, it is unlikely that a bankrupt tenant will pay the entire amount it owes us under a lease. The loss of rental payments from tenants would likely reduce proceeds from real property dispositions and distributions from such proceeds.\nThe loss of a major tenant could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are and expect that we will continue to be subject to a degree of tenant concentration at certain of our operating properties. As indicated above, we are subject to risks associated with the financial condition of our tenants. In the event that a tenant occupying a significant portion of one or more of our properties or whose rental income represents a significant portion of the rental revenue at such property or properties were to experience financial weakness, default on its lease, elect not to renew its lease or file bankruptcy it would negatively impact our financial condition and, as a result, our distributions.\nWe may experience increased operating costs, which might reduce our estimated net assets in liquidation and the sales prices received for our properties.\nOur properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as for cleaning, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, administrative costs and other costs associated with security, landscaping and repairs and maintenance of our properties. In general, under our leases with tenants, we pass through all or a portion of these costs to them. There can be no assurance that tenants will actually bear the full burden of these higher costs, or that such increased costs will not lead them, or other prospective tenants, to seek space elsewhere. If operating expenses increase, the availability of other comparable space in the geographic markets of our properties might limit our ability to increase rents; if operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish thereby reducing our estimated proceeds on disposition of real properties and limit the amount and likely delay the timing of our distributions.\nSome of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.\nWe use our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage on our properties at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. This may result in insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of the property and also may result in certain losses being totally uninsured. Inflation, changes in building codes, zoning or other land use ordinances, environmental considerations or other factors might not make it feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after such building has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds, if any, received by us might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to such property. Substantially all of our lease properties are subject to net leases, under which the tenant is required to reimburse us for a portion, all of or substantially all of the costs and/or cost increases for insurance.\nWe may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.\nThe obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as the cost of complying with future legislation, may increase our operating costs. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on or under the property. Environmental laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not such substances originated from the property. Insurance that we maintain related to potential environmental issues on our properties may not be adequate to cover all possible contingencies.\nOur common shares are thinly traded and there may not be an active, liquid trading market for our common shares.\nOur common shares are thinly traded and have substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for many other publicly traded companies. Thinly traded stocks can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market. Our stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include but are not limited to our announcement of developments related to our plan to sell our properties opportunistically (some of which are or may be the subject of enhancement efforts), stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, news reports of issues related to REITs or other real property owners and the real estate market and market forces generally. Over the past several years, the stock market has experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and market prices for the stock of many companies, including those in the real estate sector, have experienced wide price fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to operating performance. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the real estate sector of the economy, could adversely affect the price of our common shares, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. There is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common shares will be maintained on NASDAQ, or that the volume of trading will be sufficient to allow for timely trades. Investors may not be able to sell their shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or if trading volume is limited. In addition, if trading volume in our common shares is limited, trades of relatively small numbers of shares may have a disproportionate effect on the market price of our common shares. Therefore, our shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices or times that they desire.\nIf our common share were delisted from NASDAQ, shareholders may find it difficult to dispose of their shares.\nWhile we are currently in compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s shareholders\u2019 equity requirement and minimum bid price requirement, there are no assurances that we will be able to sustain long-term compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity requirement or minimum bid price requirement for continued listing, particularly as we reduce our overall assets through the distribution of sales proceeds to our shareholders. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable NASDAQ listing requirements, our common shares may be delisted. If our common shares were to be delisted from NASDAQ, trading of our common shares most likely will be conducted in the over-the-counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. Such trading will reduce the market liquidity of our common shares. As a result, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common shares. We cannot assure you that our common shares, if delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system.\nWe do not anticipate making distributions other than distributions from property dispositions or of liquidation proceeds.\nWe have not paid any dividends other than the following special dividends:\n\u25cf\nApril 9, 2007 - A special distribution of $4.00 per share.\n\u25cf\nDecember 14, 2012 - A special dividend of $38.30 per share.\n\u25cf\nDecember 30, 2013 - We paid a $98,685,000 special dividend of which approximately $68,000,000 or $45.86 per share was in cash and the remaining $20.70 per share was in interests in GSD.\n\u25cf\nJanuary 31, 2014 - We paid a $10.89 per share dividend in the form of interests in a subordinated global dividend note that was scheduled to mature on June 30, 2017.\n\u25cf\nDecember 31, 2014- We paid a $682,033 dividend (approximately $0.46 per share) in the form of interests in a subordinated global dividend note payable in kind or cash that was scheduled to mature on June 30, 2017.\nWe have a history of losses and could experience losses in the future. While we hope to begin the process of declaring special distributions as we execute our plan to sell our properties opportunistically, there can be no guarantee that we will have income to distribute, and we may not make any dividends or distributions in the future other than distributions of proceeds on the sale of the Company or any of our assets.\nThe value of our medical office parks may be affected by factors in the healthcare industry.\nApproximately 127,000 square feet of our rentable space and approximately 66% of our gross revenues for 2015 is attributable to our medical office properties. The medical office properties are subject to various operating risks common to the healthcare industry, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7\ncompetition from other medical properties in our markets;\n\u00b7\nover-building of medical parks in our markets, which adversely affects occupancy and revenues at our properties;\n\u00b7\nhospitals servicing the local markets increasing their interest in employing private practitioners or increasing their real estate portfolio of medical office space for rent or real estate/medical practice related joint ventures;\n\u00b7\nreductions in medical reimbursements from Medicaid and Medicare which directly impact private practitioners;\n\u00b7\nunknown or unidentified adverse consequences from the recent federal healthcare legislation on private practitioners will adversely affect our medical properties in the form of rent rates and tenant reimbursements; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances.\nInvestment in medical parks is capital intensive.\nOur medical properties require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. Maintaining our occupancy upon renewals or locating new tenants may require rent concessions, tenant improvements or a combination of both. Additionally, the recent federal healthcare legislation has caused some medical professionals to increase their space requirements. Our ability to relocate our tenants into more suitable space within our medical parks may be limited due to the size of the suites currently vacant and the willingness of tenants to relocate within the building. Our ability to fund capital expenditures may be limited.\nFederal health care legislation has affected medical office real estate.\nThe recent federal healthcare legislation has affected medical office real estate due to the direct impact on its tenant base. While the total impact is not immediate due to the multi-year phase in period, medical professionals are reviewing their real estate options which include remaining status quo, increasing tenant space to address a higher volume of patients as well as combining practices with other professionals. As a result, our business is being impacted by factors including (1) difficulty transitioning doctors to longer term leases, (2) difficulty raising rates, (3) increased challenges in re-leasing space and (4) difficulty transitioning tenants into larger spaces.\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition.\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in the portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited.\nThe real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nadverse changes in international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in interest rates and in the cost and terms of debt financing;\n\u00b7\nabsence of liquidity in credit markets which limits the availability and amount of debt financing;\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;\n\u00b7\nthe ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures;\n\u00b7\nchanges in operating expenses; and\n\u00b7\ncivil unrest, acts of God, including earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, and acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of the terrorist acts, such as those that occurred on September 11, 2001.\nIf the general economy weakens or the recovery becomes volatile, our operating performance and financial results may be harmed by declines in occupancy, average rate per square foot and tenant reimbursements.\nThe performance of industrial parks and the general economy have traditionally been closely linked. While medical parks traditionally have been less affected by economic downturns, the combination of the recent federal healthcare legislation and the ongoing general economic weakness have adversely affected private medical professional practitioners and demand for medical office space. We incurred a net loss before taxes of approximately $3.7 million and $2.4 million for our 2014 fiscal year and the eight months ended August 31, 2015, respectively, of which approximately $1.8 and $1.1, respectively, relate to the strategic process. A prolonged economic downturn and or economic volatility may produce continued losses. A continued weak economy may adversely and materially affect our industry, business and estimated and/or actual distributions in the liquidation process.\nWe are subject to risks stemming from the New York State budget crisis.\nOur industrial park borders Stony Brook University and the University\u2019s leases with us represent over 8% of our overall rentable space. The New York State budget crisis put additional pressure on Stony Brook University, part of the State University of New York system, to cut costs and there is no guarantee that it will continue to renew leases for equivalent space in the future. Furthermore, many of our tenants service the local area and may be adversely affected by a reduction in business from Stony Brook University. Stony Brook University currently has one remaining lease with Gyrodyne, and there is no guarantee it will renew its remaining lease when it expires in 2019.\nGeographic concentration of our properties will make our business vulnerable to economic downturns in the New York metropolitan area.\nWith the exception of the Fairfax Medical Center, all of our properties are located in the New York metropolitan area, specifically Northern Westchester and eastern Long Island. Economic conditions in these locations will significantly affect our revenues and the value of our properties. Business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other similar factors may adversely affect the economic climate in these areas. Any resulting oversupply or reduced demand for space in the New York metropolitan area would therefore have a disproportionate negative impact on our revenues.\nWe are subject to risks associated with renovations and capital improvements.\nOur properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements, including replacement of HVAC systems, parking lots, elevators, and other structural items. Tenants often require us to make periodic capital improvements as a condition of renewing leases. For the year ended December 31, 2015 we spent approximately $1,151,000 on capital improvements to our real estate portfolio. Capital improvements and renovation projects may give rise to the following risks:\n\u00b7\npossible environmental problems;\n\u00b7\nconstruction cost overruns and delays;\n\u00b7\na possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing for these capital improvements may not be available to us on affordable terms; and\n\u00b7\nuncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun.\nThe costs associated with capital improvements on our properties could adversely affect our financial condition.\nRisks associated with our investment in Callery-Judge Grove, L.P.\nWe own a limited partnership interest of approximately 10.12% in Callery Judge Grove, L.P., a New York limited partnership, which owned a 3,700+ acre citrus grove located in Palm Beach County, Florida. The property is the subject of a plan for a mixed use of residential, commercial, and industrial development which is under review by state and local municipal authorities. We face several risks inherent in ownership of a minority interest in a limited partnership.\nWe account for the investment under the equity method. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our investment was $0. We cannot predict what, if any, value we will ultimately realize from this investment.\nOn March 18, 2011, the Grove\u2019s lender, Prudential Industrial Properties, LLC (\u201cPrudential\u201d), commenced a foreclosure action against the Grove by filing a complaint in the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County to foreclose upon the Grove property, alleging that the Grove had defaulted on its loan from Prudential and that the Grove is indebted to Prudential in the amount of over $37 million in principal and over $8 million in interest and fees. We are a limited partner in the Grove but are not a guarantor of any debt related to the Grove. Our investment is held in a subsidiary where we had a $1,315,000 deferred tax liability related to the Grove which represented taxable losses not yet recorded pursuant to the equity method of accounting. Following certain taxable gains received in 2014 which were offset by prior losses that were not yet recorded, the Company reversed the deferred tax liability in total in 2014 and recorded a current tax liability of approximately $618,000 and a tax benefit of $697,000, accordingly.\nOn September 19, 2013, the Grove property was sold, the foreclosure lawsuit was dismissed and the Grove property was conveyed to Minto Florida Developments, LLC (\u201cMinto\u201d), a family-owned real estate development, construction and management company, and the Grove\u2019s debt to Prudential was repaid. Our investment continues to be held in a subsidiary of Gyrodyne with $0 carrying value but no longer has a deferred tax liability. We recognized a $618,000 deferred tax liability and a tax benefit for the balance of the 2013 deferred taxes of $697,000. The $618,000 represents the tax effect of taxable income in the current year in excess of taxable losses in prior years not yet recorded pursuant to the equity method of accounting. Gyrodyne did not receive any distribution in connection with the sale of the Grove property. Under the agreement with Minto, however, the Grove may receive certain additional payments if certain development benchmarks are achieved by Minto, which could enable future distributions to Gyrodyne. Gyrodyne cannot predict whether these benchmarks will be achieved or as to the timing or amount of any further distributions by the Grove.\nWe are limited in our ability to transfer our interest in the Grove; our interest can only be assigned or transferred upon the terms and conditions set forth in the limited partnership agreement. Those restrictions may at times preclude a transfer of our interest. We may not transfer our interest without prior written notice to, and receiving consent in writing and at the sole discretion of the Grove\u2019s managing partner. The transferor must also provide the Grove\u2019s managing partner on request an opinion of counsel that the transfer will not violate any securities, tax or other laws or rules and will not affect the tax status or treatment of the Grove. No public market for the Grove\u2019s interests exists or is contemplated in the foreseeable future.\nSince limited partners do not participate in management of the Grove\u2019s business, we must rely on the managing partner to adequately manage the Grove\u2019s affairs. The managing partner of the Grove controls the Grove and is in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the Grove\u2019s assets, including any realization or monetization of authority over any potential receivables resulting from or growing out of the aforementioned sale to Minto and including, but not limited to, the method and timing of disposition of the assets. We do not participate in the management or control of the Grove or the conduct of its business. We have only limited voting rights with respect to the Grove\u2019s affairs. We must rely upon the fiduciary responsibility and judgment of the managing partner of the Grove to manage the Grove\u2019s affairs in the best interests of the limited partners.\nOur investment in the Grove was held in a taxable REIT subsidiary and was subject to federal and state income tax on any taxable income from the investment. As a limited partner in the Grove, we have minimal influence over its management and operations. Substantial income from the Grove, either through debt forgiveness or operations, exceeded our historical losses resulting in a tax liability in 2014.", "PERMNO": 40468, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "GYRO"}
