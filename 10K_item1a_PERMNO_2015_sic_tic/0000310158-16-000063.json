The risks below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company presently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company\u2019s results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks it faces described below and elsewhere. See \u201cCautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results\u201d below.\nThe Company is dependent on its patent rights, and if its patent rights are invalidated or circumvented, its business would be adversely affected.\nPatent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance in the Company\u2019s marketing of human health products in the United States and in most major foreign markets. Patents covering products that it has introduced normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the successful marketing and sale of its products. The Company seeks patents covering each of its products in each of the markets where it intends to sell the products and where meaningful patent protection is available.\nEven if the Company succeeds in obtaining patents covering its products, third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent its patents and patent applications. It is important for the Company\u2019s business to defend successfully the patent rights that provide market exclusivity for its products. The Company is often involved in patent disputes relating to challenges to its patents or infringement and similar claims against the Company. The Company aggressively defends its important patents both within and outside the United States, including by filing claims of infringement against other parties. See Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d Note 10. \u201cContingencies and Environmental Liabilities\u201d below. In particular, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products from time to time file Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of the Company\u2019s products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned by the Company. The Company normally responds by vigorously defending its patent, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. Patent litigation and other challenges to the Company\u2019s patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive the Company of market exclusivity for a patented product or, in some cases, third-party patents may prevent the Company from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area.\nAdditionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in other circumstances, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Further, court decisions relating to other companies\u2019 patents, potential legislation relating to patents, as well as regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection.\nIf one or more important products lose patent protection in profitable markets, sales of those products are likely to decline significantly as a result of generic versions of those products becoming available and, in the case of certain products, such a loss could result in a material non-cash impairment charge. The Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected by the lost sales unless and until the Company has successfully launched commercially successful replacement products.\nA chart listing the U.S. patent protection for certain of the Company\u2019s marketed products, candidates under review and Phase 3 candidates is set forth above in Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Patents, Trademarks and Licenses.\u201d\nAs the Company\u2019s products lose market exclusivity, the Company generally experiences a significant and rapid loss of sales from those products.\nThe Company depends upon patents to provide it with exclusive marketing rights for its products for some period of time. Loss of patent protection for one of the Company\u2019s products typically leads to a significant and rapid loss of sales for that product, as lower priced generic versions of that drug become available. In the case of products that contribute significantly to the Company\u2019s sales, the loss of patent protection can have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects. For example, a court has ruled that a proposed generic form of Nasonex does not infringe the Company\u2019s U.S. patent for Nasonex. If the generic form of Nasonex receives marketing approval in the United States, the Company will experience a loss of Nasonex sales. In addition, the Company will lose U.S. patent protection for Cubicin in June 2016. Also, pursuant to an agreement with a generic manufacturer, that manufacturer may launch in the United States a generic version of Zetia in December 2016.\nKey Company products generate a significant amount of the Company\u2019s profits and cash flows, and any events that adversely affect the markets for its leading products could have a material and negative impact on results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of the Company\u2019s key products, such as Januvia, Zetia, Janumet, Gardasil/Gardasil 9, Isentress, and Vytorin. As a result of the Company\u2019s dependence on key products, any event that adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any of these products could have a significant impact on results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, generic or over-the-counter availability of the Company\u2019s product or a competitive product, the discovery of previously unknown side effects, results of post-market trials, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of the product for any reason. If any of these events had a material adverse effect on the sales of certain products, such an event could result in a material non-cash impairment charge.\nThe Company\u2019s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and the Company may not be able to acquire commercially successful products in other ways; in consequence, the Company may not be able to replace sales of successful products that have lost patent protection.\nLike other major pharmaceutical companies, in order to remain competitive, the Company must continue to launch new products each year. Expected declines in sales of products after the loss of market exclusivity mean that the Company\u2019s future success is dependent on its pipeline of new products, including new products which it may develop through joint ventures and products which it is able to obtain through license or acquisition. To accomplish this, the Company commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research and development, both through its own dedicated resources and through various collaborations with third parties. There is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process for new drugs. As a result, there is a high risk that funds invested by the Company in research programs will not generate financial returns. This risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research has a long investment cycle. To bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to market may take a decade or more and failure can occur at any point in the process, including later in the process after significant funds have been invested.\nFor a description of the research and development process, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Research and Development\u201d above. Each phase of testing is highly regulated and during each phase there is a substantial risk that the Company will encounter serious obstacles or will not achieve its goals, therefore, the Company may abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts of time and resources. Some of the risks encountered in the research and development process include the following: pre-clinical testing of a new compound may yield disappointing results; competing products from other manufacturers may reach the market first; clinical trials of a new drug may not be successful; a new drug may not be effective or may have harmful side effects; a new drug may not be approved by the regulators for its intended use; it may not be possible to obtain a patent for a new drug; payers may refuse to cover or reimburse the new product; or sales of a new product may be disappointing.\nThe Company cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products now under development will be approved or launched; whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire compounds, product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful. The Company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short term or long term would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flow, financial position and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent on the successful development and marketing of new products, which are subject to substantial risks.\nProducts that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or fail to succeed for numerous reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nfindings of ineffectiveness, superior safety or efficacy of competing products, or harmful side effects in clinical or pre-clinical testing;\n\u2022\nfailure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals, including delays in the approval of new products and new indications, and uncertainties about the time required to obtain regulatory approvals and the benefit/risk standards applied by regulatory agencies in determining whether to grant approvals;\n\u2022\nfailure in certain markets to obtain reimbursement commensurate with the level of innovation and clinical benefit presented by the product;\n\u2022\nlack of economic feasibility due to manufacturing costs or other factors; and\n\u2022\npreclusion from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others.\nIn the future, if certain pipeline programs are cancelled or if the Company believes that their commercial prospects have been reduced, the Company may recognize material non-cash impairment charges for those programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions.\nThe Company\u2019s products, including products in development, can not be marketed unless the Company obtains and maintains regulatory approval.\nThe Company\u2019s activities, including research, preclinical testing, clinical trials and manufacturing and marketing its products, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including in the EU. In the United States, the FDA is of particular importance to the Company, as it administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In many cases, the FDA requirements have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the United States. Regulation outside the United States also is primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and, in many cases, cost reduction. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion to require additional testing, to delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and to otherwise preclude distribution and sale of a product.\nEven if the Company is successful in developing new products, it will not be able to market any of those products unless and until it has obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where it proposes to market the new products. Once obtained, the Company must maintain approval as long as it plans to market its new products in each jurisdiction where approval is required. The Company\u2019s failure to obtain approval, significant delays in the approval process, or its failure to maintain approval in any jurisdiction will prevent it from selling the new products in that jurisdiction until approval is obtained, if ever. The Company would not be able to realize revenues for those new products in any jurisdiction where it does not have approval.\nDevelopments following regulatory approval may adversely affect sales of the Company\u2019s products.\nEven after a product reaches market, certain developments following regulatory approval, including results in post-marketing Phase 4 trials or other studies, may decrease demand for the Company\u2019s products, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe re-review of products that are already marketed;\n\u2022\nnew scientific information and evolution of scientific theories;\n\u2022\nthe recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed;\n\u2022\nchanging government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy or labeling changes; and\n\u2022\ngreater scrutiny in advertising and promotion.\nIn the past several years, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of the Company and of competitors within the industry have raised concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs also have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety or efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general that have negatively affected the sales of such products. In addition, increased scrutiny of the outcomes of clinical trials has led to increased volatility in market reaction. Further, these matters often attract litigation and, even where the basis for the litigation is groundless, considerable resources may be needed to respond.\nIn addition, following the wake of product withdrawals and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMA and Japan\u2019s Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency have increased their focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications and are re-reviewing select products that are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the United States, on advertising and promotion and, in particular, direct-to-consumer advertising.\nIf previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of the Company\u2019s products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require the Company to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for labeling changes. Further, in the current environment in which all pharmaceutical companies operate, the Company is at risk for product liability and consumer protection claims and civil and criminal governmental actions related to its products, research and/or marketing activities.\nThe Company faces intense competition from lower cost-generic products.\nIn general, the Company faces increasing competition from lower-cost generic products. The patent rights that protect its products are of varying strengths and durations. In addition, in some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the United States or in the EU. In the United States and the EU, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products. Although it is the Company\u2019s policy to actively protect its patent rights, generic challenges to the Company\u2019s products can arise at any time, and the Company\u2019s patents may not prevent the emergence of generic competition for its products.\nLoss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing the Company\u2019s sales of that product. Availability of generic substitutes for the Company\u2019s drugs may adversely affect its results of operations and cash flow. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time in the United States and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Any such proposal that is enacted into law could worsen this substantial negative effect on the Company\u2019s sales and, potentially, its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects.\nThe Company faces intense competition from competitors\u2019 products which, in addition to other factors, could in certain circumstances lead to non-cash impairment charges.\nThe Company\u2019s products face intense competition from competitors\u2019 products. This competition may increase as new products enter the market. In such an event, the competitors\u2019 products may be safer or more effective,\nmore convenient to use or more effectively marketed and sold than the Company\u2019s products. Alternatively, in the case of generic competition, including the generic availability of competitors\u2019 branded products, they may be equally safe and effective products that are sold at a substantially lower price than the Company\u2019s products. As a result, if the Company fails to maintain its competitive position, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects. In addition, if products that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that negatively impact product cash flows, the Company may recognize material non-cash impairment charges with respect to the value of those products.\nThe Company faces pricing pressure with respect to its products.\nThe Company faces increasing pricing pressure globally and, particularly in mature markets, from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company\u2019s sales and profit margins. In the United States, these include (i) practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) U.S. federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. The Company also faces the risk of litigation with the government over its pricing calculations. In addition, in the U.S., larger customers may, in the future, ask for and receive higher rebates on drugs in certain highly competitive categories. The Company must also compete to be placed on formularies of managed care organizations. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage in the managed care organization.\nOutside the United States, numerous major markets, including the EU and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding health care and, in that regard, fix the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Consequently, in those markets, the Company is subject to government decision making and budgetary actions with respect to its products.\nThe Company expects pricing pressures to increase in the future.\nThe health care industry in the United States will continue to be subject to increasing regulation and political action.\nThe Company believes that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as well as political and legal action, as future proposals to reform the health care system are considered by Congress and state legislatures.\nIn 2010, the United States enacted major health care reform legislation (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). Various insurance market reforms have advanced and state and federal insurance exchanges were launched in 2014. By the end of the decade, the law is expected to expand access to health care to about 32 million Americans who did not previously have insurance coverage. With respect to the effect of the law on the pharmaceutical industry, the law increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program.\nThe law also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a 50% point of service discount to Medicare Part D beneficiaries when they are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called \u201cdonut hole\u201d). Also, pharmaceutical manufacturers are now required to pay an annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee. The total annual industry fee was $3.0 billion in 2015 and will remain $3.0 billion in 2016. The fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nOn January 21, 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued the Medicaid Rebate Final Rule that implements provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act effective April 1, 2016. The rule provides comprehensive guidance on the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price; two metrics utilized to determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state Medicaid programs. Merck is still evaluating the rule to determine whether it will have a material impact on Merck\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability.\nThe Company cannot predict the likelihood of future changes in the health care industry in general, or the pharmaceutical industry in particular, or what impact they may have on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or business.\nThe uncertainty in global economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments could negatively affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe uncertainty in global economic conditions may result in a further slowdown to the global economy that could affect the Company\u2019s business by reducing the prices that drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers may be able or willing to pay for the Company\u2019s products or by reducing the demand for the Company\u2019s products, which could in turn negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales and result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects.\nGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. In many international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, other austerity measures negatively affected the Company\u2019s revenue performance in 2015. The Company anticipates these pricing actions, including the biennial price reductions in Japan that will occur again in 2016, and other austerity measures will continue to negatively affect revenue performance in 2016.\nIf credit and economic conditions worsen, the resulting economic and currency impacts in the affected markets and globally could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results.\nThe Company has significant global operations, which expose it to additional risks, and any adverse event could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe extent of the Company\u2019s operations outside the United States is significant. Risks inherent in conducting a global business include:\n\u2022\nchanges in medical reimbursement policies and programs and pricing restrictions in key markets;\n\u2022\nmultiple regulatory requirements that could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to manufacture and sell its products in key markets;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\ndiminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; and\n\u2022\npossible nationalization and expropriation.\nIn addition, there may be changes to the Company\u2019s business and political position if there is instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease.\nIn the past, the Company has experienced difficulties and delays in manufacturing of certain of its products.\nAs previously disclosed, Merck has, in the past, experienced difficulties in manufacturing certain of its vaccines and other products. The Company may, in the future, experience difficulties and delays inherent in manufacturing its products, such as (i) failure of the Company or any of its vendors or suppliers to comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines that could lead to manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages and delays in product manufacturing; (ii) construction delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for the Company\u2019s products; and (iii) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in types of products produced, or physical limitations that could impact continuous supply. Manufacturing difficulties can result in product shortages, leading to lost sales and reputational harm to the Company.\nThe Company may not be able to realize the expected benefits of its investments in emerging markets.\nThe Company has been taking steps to increase its sales in emerging markets. However, there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s efforts to expand sales in these markets will succeed. Some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of global financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on health care. In order for the Company to successfully implement its emerging markets strategy, it must attract and retain qualified personnel. The Company may also be required to increase its reliance on third-party agents within less developed markets. In addition, many of these countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and if such currencies devalue and the Company cannot offset the devaluations, the Company\u2019s financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, in China, commercial and economic conditions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth prospects in that market. While the Company continues to believe that China represents an important growth opportunity, these events, coupled with heightened scrutiny of the health care industry, may continue to have an impact on product pricing and market access generally. The Company anticipates that the reported inquiries made by various governmental authorities involving multinational pharmaceutical companies in China may continue.\nFor all these reasons, sales within emerging markets carry significant risks. However, a failure to continue to expand the Company\u2019s business in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nThe Company operates in multiple jurisdictions and virtually all sales are denominated in currencies of the local jurisdiction. Additionally, the Company has entered and will enter into acquisition, licensing, borrowings or other financial transactions that may give rise to currency and interest rate exposure.\nSince the Company cannot, with certainty, foresee and mitigate against such adverse fluctuations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flows as occurred with respect to Venezuela in 2015.\nIn order to mitigate against the adverse impact of these market fluctuations, the Company will from time to time enter into hedging agreements. While hedging agreements, such as currency options and interest rate swaps, may limit some of the exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and not always successful.\nThe Company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws, which may result in additional liabilities that may affect results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required for determining the Company\u2019s tax liabilities, and the Company\u2019s tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The Company believes that its accrual for tax contingencies is adequate for all open years based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued.\nIn March 2014, President Obama\u2019s administration re-proposed significant changes to the U.S. international tax laws, including changes that would tax companies on \u201cexcess returns\u201d attributable to certain offshore intangible assets, limit U.S. tax deductions for expenses related to un-repatriated foreign-source income and modify the U.S. foreign tax credit rules. Other potentially significant changes to the U.S. international laws, including a move toward a territorial tax system and taxing currently the accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings of controlled foreign corporations, have been set out by various Congressional committees. The Company cannot determine whether these proposals will be enacted into law or what, if any, changes may be made to such proposals prior to their being enacted into law. If these or other changes to the U.S. international tax laws are enacted, they could have a significant impact on the financial results of the Company.\nIn addition, the Company may be affected by changes in tax laws, including tax rate changes, changes to the laws related to the remittance of foreign earnings (deferral), or other limitations impacting the U.S. tax treatment of foreign earnings, new tax laws, and revised tax law interpretations in domestic and foreign jurisdictions.\nPharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns.\nUnexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as product liability, consumer fraud and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental actions.\nReliance on third party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company depends on third parties, including suppliers, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third party service providers, for key aspects of its business including development, manufacture and commercialization of its products and support for its information technology systems. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to the Company or the development of factors that materially disrupt the relationships between the Company and these third parties could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure.\nThe Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure, by the Company\u2019s workforce, others with authorized access to the Company\u2019s systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination, intentional destruction of confidential information stored in the Company\u2019s systems or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices. The Company could also experience a business interruption, intentional theft of confidential information, or reputational damage from espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, or insider threat attacks, which may compromise the Company\u2019s system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at the Company\u2019s third-party providers. Although the aggregate impact on the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition has not been material to date, the Company has been the target of events of this nature and expects them to continue. The Company monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of Company systems to reduce these risks and continues to do so on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s efforts to protect its data and systems will prevent service interruption or the loss of critical or sensitive information from the Company\u2019s or the Company\u2019s third party providers\u2019 databases or systems that could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to the Company.\nNegative events in the animal health industry could have a negative impact on future results of operations.\nFuture sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal health business. For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or mad cow disease, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company\u2019s main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt production of vaccines at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or vaccines elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. As the Animal Health segment of the Company\u2019s business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations would also become more significant.\nBiologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations.\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics, including:\n\u2022\nThere may be limited access to and supply of normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the United States and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n\u2022\nThe development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics are subject to regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the United States, a BLA, including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates and FDA approval is required for the release of each manufactured commercial lot.\n\u2022\nManufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic must undergo thorough testing for identity, strength, quality, purity and potency. Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary. Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide pre-clinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity, strength, quality, purity or potency of the products before and after such changes.\n\u2022\nBiologics are frequently costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics cannot be made synthetically. In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n\u2022\nThe use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, or closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. Any of these events could result in substantial costs.\nProduct liability insurance for products may be limited, cost prohibitive or unavailable.\nAs a result of a number of factors, product liability insurance has become less available while the cost has increased significantly. With respect to product liability, the Company self-insures substantially all of its risk, as the availability of commercial insurance has become more restrictive. The Company has evaluated its risks and has determined that the cost of obtaining product liability insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage that is available and, as such, has no insurance for certain product liabilities effective August 1, 2004, including liability for legacy Merck products first sold after that date. The Company will continually assess the most efficient means to address its risk; however, there can be no guarantee that insurance coverage will be obtained or, if obtained, will be sufficient to fully cover product liabilities that may arise.\nChanges in laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nAll aspects of the Company\u2019s business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, pricing, sales, litigation and intellectual property rights, are subject to extensive legislation and regulation. Changes in applicable federal and state laws and agency regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nSocial media platforms present risks and challenges.\nThe inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications, including from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information. In addition, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about the Company on any social networking web site could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, brand image and goodwill. Further, the disclosure of non-public Company-sensitive information by the Company\u2019s workforce or others through external media channels could lead to information loss. Although there is an internal Company Social Media Policy that guides employees on appropriate personal and professional use of social media about the Company, the processes in place may not completely secure and protect information. Identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges.\nCautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results\n(Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)\nThis report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain so-called \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d all of which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. One can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cprojects\u201d and other words of similar meaning. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address the Company\u2019s growth strategy, financial results, product development, product approvals, product potential, and development programs. One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company\u2019s forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially. The Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. The Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, they may include the following:\n\u2022Competition from generic products as the Company\u2019s products lose patent protection.\n\u2022Increased \u201cbrand\u201d competition in therapeutic areas important to the Company\u2019s long-term business performance.\n\u2022The difficulties and uncertainties inherent in new product development. The outcome of the lengthy and complex process of new product development is inherently uncertain. A drug candidate can fail at any stage of the process and one or more late-stage product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval. New product candidates may appear promising in development but fail to reach the market because of efficacy or safety concerns, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, the difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture and/or the infringement of patents or intellectual property rights of others. Furthermore, the sales of new products may prove to be disappointing and fail to reach anticipated levels.\n\u2022Pricing pressures, both in the United States and abroad, including rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement and pricing in general.\n\u2022Changes in government laws and regulations, including laws governing intellectual property, and the enforcement thereof affecting the Company\u2019s business.\n\u2022Efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales.\n\u2022Significant changes in customer relationships or changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage.\n\u2022Legal factors, including product liability claims, antitrust litigation and governmental investigations, including tax disputes, environmental concerns and patent disputes with branded and generic competitors, any of which could preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect the profitability of existing products.\n\u2022Lost market opportunity resulting from delays and uncertainties in the approval process of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities.\n\u2022Increased focus on privacy issues in countries around the world, including the United States and the EU. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect directly the Company\u2019s business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states in the United States requiring security breach notification.\n\u2022Changes in tax laws including changes related to the taxation of foreign earnings.\n\u2022Changes in accounting pronouncements promulgated by standard-setting or regulatory bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC, that are adverse to the Company.\n\u2022Economic factors over which the Company has no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nThis list should not be considered an exhaustive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.
