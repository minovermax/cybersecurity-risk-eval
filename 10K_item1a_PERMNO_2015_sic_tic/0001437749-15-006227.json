{"cik": "1046203", "company": "GUARANTY FEDERAL BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, certain risks and uncertainties. An investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included and incorporated by reference in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nNegative developments in the capital markets in recent years resulted in uncertainty in the financial markets and an economic downturn. The housing market declined, resulting in decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures. The credit performance of mortgage and construction loans resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks. The declines in the performance and value of mortgage assets encompassed all mortgage and real estate asset types, leveraged bank loans and nearly all other asset classes, including equity securities. These write-downs have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital or to merge with larger and stronger institutions. Some financial institutions have failed. Although improvements in the U.S. economy have occurred, housing prices are still depressed in some markets. While unemployment levels have improved, there are concerns over whether such improvements in the U.S. economy will continue. Moreover, the economy could be severely negatively affected by disagreements in the federal government with respect to the budget and the debt ceiling, and economic problems in Europe add to volatility in the U.S. capital markets.\nNegative economic developments would likely adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as those of our customers. As a result, we may experience increased foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies, as well as decreased loan demand.\nOur loan/lease portfolio is comprised in part of real estate loans, which involve risks specific to real estate values.\nReal estate lending comprises a significant portion of our lending business. Real estate loans were $385.3 million, or approximately 77.9% of our total loan/lease portfolio, as of December 31, 2014. The market value of real estate securing our real estate loans can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located, and in the past several years our Market Areas has experienced a general weakening in real estate valuations. Continued adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of the loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.\nThe problems that have occurred in the residential real estate and mortgage markets throughout much of the United States in recent years also affected the commercial real estate market. Our operations are heavily concentrated in Greene and Christian Counties, which are in the southwestern corner of Missouri, including the cities of Springfield, Nixa and Ozark, Missouri (previously defined as our \u201cMarket Area\u201d). In our Market Area, we generally experienced a downturn in credit performance by our commercial real estate loan customers in recent years relative to historical norms. Despite recent improvements in certain aspects of the economy, a level of uncertainty continues to exist in the economy and credit markets nationally and in our Market Area, and there can be no guarantee that we will not experience further deterioration in the performance of commercial real estate and other real estate loans in the future. In such case, we may not be able to realize the amount of security that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan, including the support of personal guarantees, if any, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and/or capital.\nRapidly changing interest rate environments could reduce net interest margin and otherwise negatively impact our results of operations.\nInterest and fees on loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, are a large part of our net income. Interest rates are the key drivers of the Company\u2019s net interest margin and are subject to many factors beyond the control of management. As interest rates change, our net interest income is affected. Rapid increases in interest rates in the future could result in our interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of mismatches in the maturities of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. Furthermore, substantially higher rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth for us. Decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between our interest rates earned on assets and our rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore decrease our net interest income.\nInterest rate changes may affect borrowers\u2019 repayment schedules, negatively impacting our financial condition.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increase the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of underlying collateral may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on certain of our loans as borrowers refinance at lower rates. Fluctuation in interest rates may therefore change borrowers\u2019 timing of repayment of, or ability to repay, loans, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our nonperforming assets, decreasing net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect the value of loans. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in our nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income.\nThe financial condition of the Bank\u2019s customers and borrowers could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s liquidity.\nTwo of the Bank\u2019s primary sources of funds are customer deposits and loan repayments. Though scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of liquidity, they are subject to the ability of the borrowers to repay their loans. The ability of the borrowers to repay their loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting the business environment, natural disasters and various other factors. Customer deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including the competitive interest rate environment in both the national market and our Market Area, local and national economic conditions, natural disasters and other various events.\nA decrease in cash flows from our investment portfolio may adversely affect our liquidity.\nAnother primary source of liquidity for the Bank is cash flows from investment instruments. Cash flows from the investment portfolio may be affected by changes in interest rates, resulting in excessive levels of cash flow during periods of declining interest rates and lower levels of cash flow during periods of rising interest rates. These changes may be beyond our control and could significantly influence our available cash.\nDifficult U.S. economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to borrow or raise capital.\nAs discussed above, since late 2007, the U.S. economy has experienced challenging economic conditions. As a result of such market conditions, the Company\u2019s stock prices have generally been negatively affected over this time period, and the ability of the Company to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets has become more difficult than it had been prior to 2007. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or desired, our ability to continue or expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nLiquidity needs could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity issues have been particularly acute for the Bank, as a community bank, as many of the larger financial institutions have significantly curtailed their lending to regional and community banks to reduce their exposure to the risks of other banks. In addition, many of the larger correspondent lenders have reduced or even eliminated federal funds lines for their correspondent customers. Furthermore, regional and community banks, including the Bank, generally have less access to the capital markets than do the national and super-regional banks because of their smaller size and limited analyst coverage. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet its expenses, pay dividends to its stockholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying its borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company is required to rely on secondary sources of liquidity, those sources may not be immediately available.\nThe Company may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include the Federal Home Loan Bank advances, brokered deposits and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks. The Company may also pledge investments as collateral to borrow money from third parties. In certain cases, the Company may sell investment instruments for sizable losses to meet liquidity needs, reducing net income. While the Company believes that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity needs.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.\nWe face competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans, and providing other financial services throughout our Market Area. Our competitors include other community banks, regional and super-regional banking institutions, national banking institutions, and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, government-sponsored enterprises, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage companies, and other non-bank businesses. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than the Company and are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as the Company is subject. Many of our unregulated competitors compete across geographic boundaries and are able to provide customers with a feasible alternative to traditional banking services. In addition, challenging economic conditions nationally and in our Market Area have resulted in an increase in competition for the Bank with other depository institutions for deposits and quality loans.\nIncreased competition in our markets may result in a decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits, reduced spreads between loan rates and deposit rates or loan terms that are more favorable to the borrower as we try to meet our competitors\u2019 terms and pricing. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on its ability to grow and remain profitable. If increased competition causes us to significantly discount the interest rates we offer on loans or increase the amount we pay on deposits, our net interest income could be adversely impacted. If increased competition causes us to modify our underwriting standards, we could be exposed to higher losses from lending activities.\nInability to hire or retain certain key professionals, management and staff could adversely affect our revenues, net income and growth plans.\nWe rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as our loan and deposit portfolios. The loss of key management and staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting, hiring, and training expenses, resulting in lower net income.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation that can limit or restrict its activities.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various agencies, including the FRB, the MDF and the FDIC. The Company\u2019s regulatory compliance is costly. As discussed above, the Company is also subject to capitalization guidelines established by its regulators, which require it and the Bank to maintain adequate capital to support its and the Bank\u2019s growth. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry can change at any time, and the Company cannot predict the effects of these changes on its business. To the extent activities of the Company and/or the Bank are restricted or limited by regulation or regulators\u2019 supervisory authority, the Company\u2019s future profitability may be adversely affected.\nFinancial reform legislation has caused numerous changes to our operations and has resulted in new regulations that have increased, and are expected to further increase, our operation costs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, including future rules implementing its provisions and interpretations of those rules, could adversely impact the Company in a number of ways. As discussed above, although some new regulations are already effective, many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have extended implementation periods, delayed effective dates, and require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities. Accordingly, an assessment of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s full effect on the Company is not currently possible.\nHowever, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that could adversely affect the Company include, as examples, the new capital and liquidity requirements with which the Company must comply. Additional pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act financial institutions may now pay interest on business checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense.\nMoreover, the CFB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. Since its creation, CFB has been an active regulator, issuing many new rules and extensively growing its enforcement efforts. These changes, along with others, may impose significant additional costs on the Company, impede its growth opportunities and place it at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as any other current, proposed, or future regulatory or legislative changes to applicable laws, may impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. Such regulatory or legislative changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary adjustments to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our management is actively reviewing the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and assessing the probable impact on our operations. However, the ultimate effect of these changes on the financial services industry in general, and us in particular, is uncertain at this time.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules on the Company is uncertain.\nIn July 2013, the U.S. federal banking authorities approved the implementation of the Basel III capital framework and issued rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III framework is applicable to all U.S. banks that are subject to minimum capital requirements, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies other than \u201csmall bank holding companies\u201d (generally bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $500 million). The Basel III framework not only increases most of the required minimum regulatory capital ratios, but it introduces a new Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio and the concept of a capital conservation buffer. The Basel III framework also expands the definition of \u201ccapital\u201d by establishing criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (Tier 1 Capital in addition to Common Equity) and Tier 2 Capital. A number of instruments that now generally qualify as Tier 1 Capital will not qualify, or their qualifications will change when the Basel III Rules are fully implemented. The Basel III framework also permits banking organizations with less than $15.0 billion in assets to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income, which currently does not affect regulatory capital. The Basel III framework has maintained the general structure of the current prompt corrective action framework, while incorporating the increased requirements. The prompt corrective action guidelines were also revised to add the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. In order to be a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d depository institution under the new regime, a bank and holding company must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.5% or more; a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 8% or more; a Total Capital ratio of 10% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. Generally, financial institutions become subject to the new Basel III Rules on January 1, 2015, with phase-in periods for many of the changes.\nAlthough we continue to evaluate the impact that the new capital rules will have on the Company and the Bank, we anticipate that the Company and the Bank will remain well-capitalized under the new capital rules, and will meet the capital conservation buffer requirement.\nManagement\u2019s analysis of the necessary funding for the allowance for loan loss account may be incorrect or may suddenly change resulting in lower earnings.\nThe funding of the allowance for loan loss account is the most significant estimate made by management in its financial reporting to stockholders and regulators. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes. Although management believes that the allowance for loan/lease losses as of December 31, 2014 was adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans/leases that may become uncollectible, in light of the current economic environment, which remains challenging, the Company cannot predict loan losses with certainty, and the Company cannot assure you that our allowance for loan losses will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions are more difficult than management currently expects. If negative changes to the performance of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio were to occur, management may find it necessary or be required to fund the allowance for loan loss account through additional charges to the Company\u2019s provision for loan loss expense. These changes may occur suddenly and be dramatic in nature. Additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses and loan losses in excess of the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as that of our customers engaging in internet banking activities, which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms used to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. Any interruption in, or breach of security of, our computer systems and network infrastructure, or that of our internet banking customers, could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon outside third parties for processing and handling of our records and data.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for a substantial portion of our communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. If any of these third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties, security breaches, or if there is any disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to locate alternative sources for these services. There can be no assurance that we could negotiate terms as favorable to us or obtain services with similar functionality as we currently have without the expenditure of substantial resources. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, including economic conditions specifically in our Market Area, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe effects of the monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve upon our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future cannot be predicted, but have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including our Bank, in the past.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $86.5 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, and continued instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires us to make difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is concentrated in and largely dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of the general geographical markets in which we operate.\nOur operations are heavily concentrated in our Market Area and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in the economic conditions in those areas. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets. Although our customers' business and financial interests may extend well beyond our Market Area, adverse economic conditions that affect these market areas into which our customers\u2019 business and financial interests extend could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us, affect the value of collateral underlying loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of our geographic concentration, we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect the Company.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions, including the Bank, are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of the difficulties or failures of other banks, which would increase the capital we need to support our growth.\nOur reputation could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, or the risk to us from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, ethical behavior of our employees, and from actions taken by regulators, ratings agencies and others as a result of that conduct. Damage to our reputation could impact our ability to attract new or maintain existing loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships.\nThe repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on business demand deposits could increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on us.\nAll federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on business demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, some financial institutions have commenced offering interest on these demand deposits to compete for customers. If competitive pressures require us to pay interest on these demand deposits to attract and retain business customers, our interest expense would increase and our net interest margin would decrease. This could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, the effect of the repeal of the prohibition could be more significant in a higher interest rate environment as business customers would have a greater incentive to seek interest on demand deposits.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and which may differ from actual results.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and general reporting practices within the financial services industry, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some accounting policies, such as those pertaining to our allowance for loan losses, require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods.", "PERMNO": 81560, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "GFED"}
