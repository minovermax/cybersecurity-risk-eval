RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Liquidity and Credit Agreement\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions, which may or may not be successful, to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our Credit Agreement with certain lenders and McLarty, as Administrative Agent. In the absence of such cash flows or capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our senior secured Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our senior secured notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from such dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result:\n\u00a7 Our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable; and\n\u00a7 We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur Credit Agreement contains covenants that may limit the way we conduct business. Our Credit Agreement contains various covenants limiting our ability to:\n\u00a7 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u00a7 pay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u00a7 pre-pay any subordinated indebtedness;\n\u00a7 make investments and other restricted payments;\n\u00a7 make capital expenditures;\n\u00a7 enter into merger or acquisition transactions; and\n\u00a7 sell assets.\nThese covenants may prevent us from raising additional debt or equity financing, competing effectively or taking advantage of new business opportunities.\nOur Credit Agreement includes covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to satisfy those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot be certain we will satisfy those ratios. As of March 31, 2015, we were not in compliance with our minimum cash balance requirement, which was waived by our lenders on April 15, 2015.\nOur Credit Agreement provides that the failure to comply with the financial ratios or other covenants or a material adverse change in our business, assets or prospects constitutes an \u201cevent of default.\u201d If we are unable to comply with the financial ratios, comply with other covenants as specified in the Credit Agreement, our lenders may choose to assert an event of default under our Credit Agreement. In this event, unless we are able to negotiate an amendment, forbearance or waiver, we could be required to repay all amounts then outstanding, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to generate the amount of cash needed to fund our future operations. Our ability either to fund planned capital expenditures and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash is in part subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our liquidity needs.\nOur liquidity depends on our cash-on-hand, operating cash flows and ability to collect cash receipts. At March 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $3.1 million and, in accordance with the April 15, 2015 amendment to the Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain $1.0 million of cash at all times. We rely on our cash-on-hand, operating cash flows and ability to collect cash receipts to fund our operations and meet our financial obligations. Delays or any failure to collect our trade accounts receivable would have a negative effect on our liquidity.\nWe have pledged our intellectual property assets to secure our Credit Agreement, and this represents a risk to our business, results of operations and financial condition. In order to secure the financing necessary to operate our business, we pledged all of our intellectual property rights as collateral to our Credit Agreement. If we were to default on our obligations under the Credit Agreement, we could forfeit our intellectual property and, thereby, a primary source of revenue. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are seeking additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to us. We are exploring various equity financing alternatives. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may be required to delay or reduce our operations. We cannot assure you that any necessary additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. Market and industry factors may harm the market price of our common stock and may adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds. Similarly, if our common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, it may limit our ability to raise additional funds.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have limited working capital and limited access to financing. Our cash requirements, at times, may exceed the level of cash generated by operations. Accordingly, we may have limited working capital.\nOur ability to obtain adequate additional financing on satisfactory terms may be limited and our Credit Agreement prevents us from incurring additional indebtedness. Our ability to raise financing through sales of equity securities depends on general market conditions, including the demand for our common stock. We may be unable to raise adequate capital through the sale of equity securities, and if we were able to sell equity, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. If adequate financing is not available at all or it is unavailable on acceptable terms, we may find we are unable to fund expansion, continue offering products and services, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance services or products, or respond to competitive pressures in the industry.\nOur business requires a substantial investment of capital. The production, acquisition and distribution of programming require a significant amount of capital. Capital available for these purposes will be reduced to the extent that we are required to use funds otherwise budgeted for capital investment to fund our operations and/or make scheduled payments on our debt obligations. Curtailed content investment over a sustained period could have a material adverse effect on future operating results and cash flows. Further, a significant amount of time may elapse between our expenditure of funds and the receipt of revenues from our television programs or motion pictures. This time lapse requires us to fund a significant portion of our capital requirements from our operating cash flow and from other financing sources. Although we intend to continue to mitigate the risks of our production exposure through pre-sales to broadcasters and distributors, tax credit programs, government and industry programs, co-financiers and other sources, we cannot assure you that we will continue to successfully implement these arrangements or that we will not be subject to substantial financial risks relating to the production, acquisition, completion and release of new television programs and motion pictures. In addition, if we increase (through internal growth or acquisition) our production slate or our production budgets, we may be required to increase overhead and/or make larger up-front payments to talent and, consequently, bear greater financial risks. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur inability to gauge and predict the commercial success of our programming could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Operating in the entertainment industry involves a substantial degree of risk. Each video program or feature film is an individual artistic work, and its commercial success is primarily determined by unpredictable audience reactions. The commercial success of a title also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs or titles released into the marketplace, critical reviews, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible external factors, all of which are subject to change and cannot be predicted. Timing is also sometimes relevant to a program\u2019s success, especially when the program concerns a recent event or historically relevant material (e.g., an anniversary of a historical event which focuses media attention on the event and accordingly spurs interest in related content). Our success depends in part on the popularity of our content and our ability to gauge and predict it. Even if a film achieves success during its initial release, the popularity of a particular program and its ratings may diminish over time. Our inability to gauge and predict the commercial success of our programming could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to recoup advances paid to secure exclusive distribution rights. Our most significant costs and cash expenditures relate to acquiring content for exclusive distribution. Most agreements to acquire content require upfront advances against royalties or net profits participations expected to be earned from future distribution. The amount we are willing to advance is derived from our estimate of net revenues that will be realized from our distribution of the title. Although these estimates are based on management\u2019s knowledge of current events and actions management may undertake in the future, actual results will differ from those estimates. If sales do not meet our original estimates, we may (i) not recognize the expected gross margin or net profit, (ii) not recoup our advances or (iii) record accelerated amortization and/or fair value write-downs of advances paid. We recorded impairments of $4.8 million and $6.4 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to our investments in content.\nOur inability to maintain relationships with our program suppliers and vendors may adversely affect our business. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from the distribution of content for which we already have exclusive agreements with program suppliers. However, titles which have been financed by us may not be timely delivered as agreed or may not be of the expected quality. Delays or inadequacies in delivery of titles, including rights clearances, could negatively affect the performance of any given quarter or year. In addition, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if:\n\u00a7 We are unable to renew our existing agreements as they expire;\n\u00a7 Our current program suppliers do not continue to support digital, DVD or other applicable format in accordance with our exclusive agreements;\n\u00a7 Our current content suppliers do not continue to license titles to us on terms acceptable to us; or\n\u00a7 We are unable to establish new beneficial supplier relationships to ensure acquisition of exclusive or high-profile titles in a timely and efficient manner.\nDisputes over intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our sales and net revenues depend heavily on the exploitation of intellectual property owned by us or third parties from whom we have licensed intellectual property. Should a dispute arise over, or a defect be found in, the chain of title in any of our key franchises, this could result in either a temporary suspension of distribution or an early termination of our distribution license. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe, and third parties that manage portions of our secure data, are subject to cybersecurity risks and incidents. Our direct-to-consumer business involves the storage and transmission of customers' personal information, shopping preferences and credit card information, in addition to employee information and our financial and strategic data. The protection of our customer, employee and company data is vitally important to us. While we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, any failure of these measures and any failure of third parties that assist us in managing our secure data could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA high rate of product returns may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. As with the major studios and other independent companies in this industry, we experience a relatively high level of product returns as a percentage of our revenues. Our allowances for sales returns may not be adequate to cover potential returns in the future, particularly in the case of consolidation within the home-video retail marketplace, which when it occurs tends to result in inventory consolidation and increased returns. We have experienced a high rate of product returns over the past three years. We expect a relatively high rate of product returns to continue, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on third-party shipping and fulfillment companies for the delivery of our products. If these companies experience operational difficulties or disruptions, our business could be adversely affected. We rely on SPHE, our distribution facilitation and manufacturing partner in North America, Sony DADC UK Limited in the U.K, and Trade Global, our fulfillment partner in the U.S. for a majority of our Direct-to-Consumer sales, to determine the best delivery method for our products. These partners rely entirely on arrangements with third-party shipping companies, principally Federal Express and UPS, for small package deliveries and less-than-truckload service carriers for larger deliveries, for the delivery of our products. The termination of arrangements between our partners and one or more of these third-party shipping companies, or the failure or inability of one or more of these third-party shipping companies to deliver products on a timely or cost-efficient basis from our partners to our customers, could disrupt our business, reduce net sales and harm our reputation. Furthermore, an increase in the amount charged by these shipping companies could negatively affect our gross margins and earnings.\nEconomic weakness may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The global economic downturn had a significant negative effect on our revenues and may continue to do so. As consumers reduced spending and scaled back purchases of our products, we experienced higher product returns and lower sales, which adversely affected our revenues and results of operations in previous years. Although consumer spending has improved over the last few years, weak consumer demand for our products may occur and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur high concentration of sales to and receivables from relatively few customers (and use of a third-party to manage collection of substantially all packaged goods receivables) may result in significant uncollectible accounts receivable exposure, which may adversely affect our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition. During 2014, our net revenues from Amazon were 19.0% of our net revenues. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 46.2% of our net revenues for 2014. SPHE and Netflix accounted for approximately 44.0% and 21.4%, respectively, of our gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014.\nWe may be unable to maintain favorable relationships with our retailers and distribution facilitators including SPHE and Sony DADC UK Limited. Further, our retailers and distribution facilitators may be adversely affected by economic conditions. If we lose any of our top customers or distribution facilitators, or if any of these customers reduces or cancels a significant order, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face credit exposure from our retail customers and may experience uncollectible receivables from these customers should they face financial difficulties. If these customers fail to pay their accounts receivable, file for bankruptcy or significantly reduce their purchases of our programming, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nA high concentration of our gross accounts receivables is attributable to SPHE and Sony DADC UK Limited, as they are our vendor of record for shipments of physical product to North American and U.K. retailers and wholesalers. As part of our arrangement with our distribution facilitation partners, SPHE and Sony DADC UK Limited collect the receivables from our end customers, provide us with monthly advance payments on such receivables (less a reserve), and then true up the accounts receivables accounting quarterly. While we remain responsible for the credit risk from the end customer, if SPHE or Sony DADC UK Limited should fail to adequately collect and pay us the accounts receivable they collect on our behalf, whether due to inadequate processes and procedures, inability to pay, bankruptcy or otherwise, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not control the timing of dividends paid by ACL, which could negatively impact our cash flow. Although we hold a 64% interest in ACL, we do not control the board of directors of ACL. The members of the Agatha Christie family, who hold the remaining 36% interest in ACL, have the right to appoint the same number of directors as us and, in the event of deadlock on any decision of the board, also have a second or casting vote exercised by their appointee as chairman of ACL, which allows them to exercise control of ACL\u2019s board of directors.\nUnder English law, the amount, timing and form of payment of any dividends or other distributions is a matter for ACL\u2019s board of directors to determine, and, as a result, we cannot control when these distributions are made. If ACL\u2019s board of directors decides not to authorize distributions, our revenue and cash flow may decrease, materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur business plan and future growth depend in part on our ability to commercialize the IP owned by ACL based on commissions for new programming from broadcasters, over whom we have no control. If we are unable to successfully implement this strategy, the results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our financial condition and results of operation will depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize the IP owned by ACL. Whether we are able to successfully commercialize the IP owned by ACL, including the creation of new content, will depend, in part, on ACL obtaining commissions for new programming from broadcasters (such as ITV, BBC, and Sky in the UK and Fox, Disney and other studios in the U.S.). The ability to obtain commissions for new programming from broadcasters will depend on many factors outside of our control, including audience preferences and demand, financial condition of the broadcasters, the broadcasters\u2019 budgets and access to financing, competitive pressures and the impact of actual and projected general economic conditions. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such commissions for new programming within our anticipated timeframe or at all. Without such commissions for new programming, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the IP of ACL in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all. Failure to obtain commissions for new programming could adversely affect our market share, revenue, financial condition, results of operations, relationships with our distributors and retailers and our ability to expand our market, all of which would materially adversely affect our business, revenues and financial results.\nWe depend on key and highly skilled personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel or hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our business could be harmed. Our success continues to depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train and retain qualified professional, creative, technical and managerial personnel. Moreover, we believe that our success greatly depends on the contributions of our Chairman, Robert L. Johnson, executive officers including Chief Executive Officer, Miguel Penella, and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew S. Wilson, and other key executives. Although we have employment agreements with certain members of our executive management, any of our employees may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. The loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could delay the acquisition of content and harm the market's perception of us. Competition for the caliber of talent required to acquire and exploit content continues to increase.If we are unable to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to succeed, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nWe face risks from doing business internationally. We exploit and derive revenues from television programs and feature films outside the U.S., directly in the U.K. and in Australia, and through various third-party licensees elsewhere. As a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u00a7 Laws and policies affecting trade, investment and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;\n\u00a7 Changes in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on content, differing cultural tastes and attitudes;\n\u00a7 Differing degrees of protection for intellectual property;\n\u00a7 Financial instability and increased market concentration of buyers in foreign television markets, including in European pay television markets;\n\u00a7 The instability of foreign economies and governments;\n\u00a7\nFluctuating foreign exchange rates; and\n\u00a7 War and acts of terrorism.\nEvents or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from non-U.S. sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nChanges to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may affect how we conduct our business and affect our reported results of operations. New accounting pronouncements or tax rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in accounting pronouncements or interpretations or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. Changes to existing rules and pronouncements, future changes, if any, or the questioning of current practices or interpretations may materially adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations, and changes in geographic operating results, may adversely affect our effective tax rates. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws, by changes in the amount of revenue or earnings that we derive from international sources in countries with high or low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from possible examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. In making such assessments, we exercise judgment in estimating our provision for income taxes. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that final determinations from any examinations will not be materially different from those reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Any adverse outcome from any examinations may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nRevenues from the sale of DVD\u2019s are declining. During calendar 2014, the standard DVD marketplace experienced the eighth straight year-over-year decline for the category since the format debuted in 1997. We estimate that approximately 52.3% of our current net revenue base is generated from the sale of physical goods, which include the revenues from the sale of DVDs. The continued maturation of the standard DVD format may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDecreasing retail prices for DVDs may negatively affect our revenues and gross profit margins. The home entertainment programming market in which we compete is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Many of our competitors, including major studios, are increasingly offering programming, particularly DVD programming, at lower prices. They may be able to produce or secure content on more favorable terms and may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. While we strive to improve our operating efficiencies and leverage our fixed costs so that we can afford to pass along these savings to our customers in the form of lower prices, the industry trend of lowering prices may, over time, led to lower sales, decreased profit margins or decreased overall revenues.\nDecreasing retail shelf space for our industry may limit sales of our programming, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face increasing competition from major motion picture studios and other independent content suppliers for limited retail shelf space, which space has been shrinking in absolute terms as brick and mortar retailers have fewer stores and lower budgets for the home-video space within their stores. Our exclusive content competes for a finite amount of shelf space against a large and diverse supply of entertainment content from other suppliers. New releases generally exceed several hundred titles a week. We believe this competition can be especially challenging for independent labels like us, because the new releases of major studios often have extremely high visibility, greater marketing support and sales projections in the millions of units, which typically require much more shelf space to support.\nShelf space limitations at our brick and mortar retail customers are exacerbated by the increasing popularity of the high-definition format, Blu-ray. The combination of standard discs, premium discs and special-edition boxed sets across two formats means that a release can come in as many six different configurations. With the possible exception of our most popular new release titles and top-selling catalog titles, it can be a challenge to obtain the product placement necessary to maximize sales, particularly among the limited number of major retailers who comprise our core brick and mortar customers. The continued retailer trend toward greater visibility for titles at the expense of quantity (i.e., \u201cface out\u201d rather than \u201cspine out\u201d placement) has the effect of reducing the total number of titles actually carried by a retailer.\nWe cannot accurately predict the overall effect shifting audience tastes, technological change or the availability of alternative forms of entertainment may have on distributors. In addition to uncertainty regarding the DVD market, there is uncertainty as to whether other developing distribution channels and formats, such as VOD and internet distribution of television and films, will attain expected levels of public acceptance, or if such channels or formats are accepted by the public, whether we will be successful in exploiting the business opportunities they provide. Moreover, to the extent that these emerging distribution channels and formats gain popular acceptance, the demand for delivery through DVDs may decrease.\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly. Our results of operations are difficult to predict and depend on a variety of factors. Our results of operations depend significantly upon the commercial success of the television programming and feature films that we exploit, which cannot be predicted with certainty. In particular, the underperformance of the VOD or SVOD window of one or more motion pictures in any period may cause our revenue and earnings results for that period (and potentially, subsequent periods) to be less than anticipated, in some instances to a significant extent. Accordingly, our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future periods.\nOur results of operations also fluctuate due to the timing, mix, number and availability of our broadcast, home entertainment and theatrical motion picture releases, as well as license periods for our content. Our operating results may increase or decrease during a particular period or year due to differences in the number and/or mix of films released compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.\nRisks Relating to Our Stock\nOur stock price may be subject to substantial volatility, and stockholders may lose all or a substantial part of their investment. Our common stock currently trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market (NASDAQ). There is limited public float, and trading volume historically has been low and sporadic. As a result, the market price for our common stock may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of our fair market value. The price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the number of shares available for sale in the market, quarterly variations in our operating results, actual or anticipated announcements of new releases by us or competitors, the gain or loss of significant customers, changes in the estimates of our operating performance, fluctuations in the fair value of our common stock warrant liability and market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole.\nAny future sales of equity may significantly affect the market price of our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares that we may issue upon exercise of outstanding warrants, or other convertible securities, if any, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and the price of our common stock may fall. New equity securities issued may also have greater rights, preferences or privileges than our existing common stock.\nAdditional authorized shares of common stock available for issuance may adversely affect the market. We are authorized to issue 250,000,000 shares of our common stock. As of April 30, 2015, we had 12,895,772 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, excluding shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants. As of April 30, 2015, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 21,041,667 shares of our common stock at a price of $12.00 per share. To the extent the shares of common stock are issued or warrants are exercised, holders of our common stock will experience dilution. In addition, our financing composed of securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock will result in dilution to holders of our common stock.\nWe may choose to redeem our outstanding warrants at a time that is disadvantageous to the warrant holders. Subject to there being a current prospectus under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, we may redeem all of our outstanding warrants at any time at a price of $0.01 per warrant, upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption if, and only if, the last sale price of shares of our common stock equals or exceeds $17.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption. If we were to call all of our outstanding warrants for redemption, the warrant holders could be forced:\n\u00a7 To pay the cash exercise price for such warrants at a time when it may be disadvantageous for the holders to do so;\n\u00a7 To sell the warrants at the then current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold the warrants; or\n\u00a7 To accept the nominal redemption price, which at the time the warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of the warrants.\nProvisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and Nevada law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Nevada law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nWe have disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the review of content ultimates and the preparation and review of reconciliations that could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis. In connection with our assessment of internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for fiscal 2014, we identified a material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the review of content ultimates and the preparation and review of reconciliations. For a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weakness, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\u201d under Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the preparation of the annual report, management identified errors that, although not material to the consolidated financial statements, led management to conclude that control deficiencies exist related to the review of content ultimates and the preparation and review of reconciliations. During fiscal 2015, the Company commenced a remediation plan to address these control deficiencies.\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition or results of operations or maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC and NASDAQ, including a delisting from the NASDAQ, which could adversely affect the valuation of our common stock and could adversely affect our business prospects.", "PERMNO": 13655, "SIC": 7822, "TIC": "RLJE"}
