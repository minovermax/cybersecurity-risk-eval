{"cik": "1642375", "company": "Guardion Health Sciences, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in the Company\u2019s common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included or referred to in this Form 10-K, before purchasing shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. There are numerous and varied risks that may prevent the Company from achieving its goals. If any of these risks actually occurs, the business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline and investors in the Company\u2019s common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nAs the Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows since our inception, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern absent additional financing, which the Company may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all.\nThe Company has incurred net losses since inception in 2009 and cannot be certain if or when the Company will produce sufficient revenue from operations to support costs. The Company had a net loss of $10,878,308 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and a net loss of $7,767,407 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $45,511,671 as of December 31, 2019. The Company expects to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flows in the near-term.\nThe Company will continue to incur significant expenses for commercialization activities related to its medical foods Lumega-Z\u00ae and Glauco-CetinTM, its nutraceuticals product line, the MapcatSF\u00ae medical device and the CSV-1000 and CSV-2000 medical devices, and with respect to efforts to build its infrastructure and expand its operations.\nEven if profitability is achieved in the future, the Company may not be able to sustain profitability on a consistent basis. The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. The Company\u2019s financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company\u2019s auditors have made reference to the substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in their audit report on its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. Because the Company has been issued an opinion by its auditors that substantial doubt exists as to whether the Company can continue as a going concern, it may be more difficult for the Company to attract investors. The Company\u2019s future is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations.\nThe Company does not have any credit facilities as a source of present or future funds, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. The Company may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings and debt financings. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting the ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, would increase expenses and require that Company assets secure such debt. Moreover, any debt the Company incurs must be repaid regardless of our operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, operating performance and investor sentiment. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, the Company may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms, which would likely have a material adverse effect on its business, stock price and relationships with third parties, at least until additional funding is obtained. If the Company does not have sufficient funds to continue operations, the Company could be required to seek other alternatives that would likely result in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment.\nThe Company\u2019s future success is largely dependent on the successful commercialization of Lumega-Z\u00ae and GlaucoCetinTM medical foods, its line of nutraceuticals, the MapcatSF\u00ae medical device, and the CSV-1000 and CSV-2000 medical devices.\nThe future success of the Company\u2019s business is largely dependent upon the successful commercialization of its medical foods, nutraceuticals and medical devices. If the Company is unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to do so, it may be unable to successfully commercialize its products. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues the Company may be able to generate from sales. If this occurs, it will have an adverse impact on operations and the Company\u2019s ability to fund future development and commercialization efforts.\nThe Company may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the VectorVision acquisition and NutriGuard Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. The Company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating VectorVision and NutriGuard into the existing business and VectorVision and NutriGuard may underperform relative to the Company\u2019s expectations.\nThe Company may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the VectorVision acquisition and NutriGuard Acquisition. The Company has integrated the business of VectorVision and begun to integrate NutriGuard with its legacy businesses, and the Company may continue to devote significant management attention and resources to operate and grow these businesses. The failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the VectorVision acquisition and the NutriGuard Acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the Company\u2019s operations and could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, continued operation of VectorVision and NutriGuard may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customers and other business relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. Additional challenges may include, among other things, difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects and the impact of potential liabilities the Company may be assuming from VectorVision or NutriGuard.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company conducted its annual impairment analysis, considering multiple qualitative observations and indicators, including our customer relationships, the regulatory environment as it impacts medical devices, market penetration expectations and barriers, and our anticipated competitive environment. In addition, we assessed the operating results of our VectorVision reporting unit against the quantitative assumptions we used when determining the initial fair values associated with the 2017 business combination. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,563,520 and has accelerated the remaining amortization expense of $191,468 on its identifiable intangible assets as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Company has limited experience in developing medical foods, medical devices and nutraceuticals and it may be unable to commercialize some of the products and services it develops or acquires.\nDevelopment and commercialization of medical foods and medical devices involves a lengthy and complex process. The Company has limited experience in developing products and has only two commercialized medical food products on the market, Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin. In addition, no one has ever developed or commercialized a medical device like the MapcatSF. The Company cannot assure you that it is possible to further develop or successfully commercialize the MapcatSF or that it will be successful in doing so. The Company is preparing to launch the CSV-2000, but there is no assurance the introduction of the instrument will be successful. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the NutriGuard nutraceuticals will be marketable or that the Company will achieve commercial success with the product line.\nEven if the Company develops or acquires products for commercial use, these products may not be accepted by the medical and pharmaceutical marketplaces or be capable of being offered at prices that will enable the Company to become profitable. The Company cannot assure you that its products will be approved by regulatory authorities, if required, or ultimately prove to be useful for commercial markets, meet applicable regulatory standards, or be successfully marketed.\nThe Company\u2019s ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt its current operations.\nThe Company has invested and expects to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The expansion into the transcranial doppler testing business is a reflection of its ongoing efforts to innovate and provide useful products and services. Such endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on the Company\u2019s investments, distraction of management from current operations, and unidentified issues not discovered in its due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause the Company to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe Company and its suppliers and manufacturers are subject to a number of existing laws, regulations and industry initiatives and the regulatory environment of the healthcare industry is continuing to change. If it is determined that the Company or its suppliers or manufacturers are not in compliance with the laws and regulations to which they are respectively subject, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs a participant in the healthcare industry, the Company\u2019s operations and relationships, and those of the Company\u2019s customers, are regulated by a number of federal, state, local, and foreign governmental entities, and the Company\u2019s products must be capable of being used by its customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations. For example, from the FDA\u2019s perspective, a drug cures, treats, or mitigates the effects or symptoms of a specific disease. A medical food manages a specific disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation. While the Company believes Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin are medical foods, if the FDA determines Lumega-Z or GlaucoCetin to be a drug, the Company and the product would be subject to considerable additional FDA regulation. Similarly, the Company believes the MapcatSF is correctly classified as a Class I medical device, which does not require any premarket approval. The Company also believes the CSV-2000 is a Class I medical device. If, however, the FDA were to determine that the MapcatSF or CSV-2000 is a Class II medical device, the Company and the particular product or products would be subject to considerable additional regulatory requirements.\nThe NutriGuard line of products are nutraceuticals and are regulated as dietary supplements under the Dietary Supplement, Health and Education Act of 1994 (\u201cDSHEA\u201d). Although dietary supplements are considered a separate regulatory category of food from consumer food products and medical foods, the FDA requires facilities that manufacture nutraceuticals to comply with regulations for current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d). The Company does not manufacture any of the medical foods or nutraceuticals internally. The Company relies on contract manufacturers to manufacture the products. The FDA cGMP regulations largely are applicable to the site where the product is manufactured. Thus, the Company depends on the contract manufacturers to maintain cGMP compliance.\nIn addition, the Company cannot anticipate how changes in regulations or determinations by regulatory agencies may evolve. Thus, application of many foreign, state and federal regulations to the Company\u2019s business operations is uncertain. Further, there are federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws and limitations on physician referrals and laws related to off-label promotion of prescription drugs that may or may not be directly or indirectly applicable to the Company\u2019s operations and relationships or the business practices of its customers. It is possible that a review of its business practices or those of its customers by courts or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that may adversely affect the Company. In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts existing operations or growth. The healthcare industry is expected to continue to undergo significant changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company cannot predict the effect of possible future legislation and regulation.\nThe Company may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and other sanctions if it is deemed to be promoting the use of its products as a drug.\nThe Company\u2019s business and future growth depend on the development, use and ultimate sale of products that are subject to FDA regulation, clearance and approval. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, the Company is prohibited from promoting its products for treatment of a condition or disease. This means that the Company may not make claims about the usefulness or effectiveness or expected outcome of use of its products for any particular condition or disease and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the use of its products, except as allowed by the FDA.\nThere is a risk that the FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities could determine that the nature and scope of our sales and marketing activities may constitute the promotion of our products for use as a drug in violation of applicable law. The Company also faces the risk that the FDA or other regulatory authorities might pursue enforcement based on past activities that the Company discontinued or changed, including sales activities, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs and other activities.\nGovernment investigations are typically expensive, disruptive, burdensome and generate negative publicity. If its promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if the Company agrees to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, the Company would likely face significant fines and penalties and would likely be required to substantially change its sales, promotion and educational activities. In addition, were any enforcement actions against the Company or its senior officers to arise, the Company could be excluded from participation in U.S. government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nThe Company\u2019s products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent any required regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\nIf the Company\u2019s products, including Lumega-Z, GlaucoCetin or the NutriGuard line of products, are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, the Company may need to abandon its development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Any serious adverse or undesirable side effects identified during the development of its products, could interrupt, delay or halt commercialization and/or could result in the additional regulatory requirements by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and in turn prevent the Company from commercializing its product candidates and generating revenues from their sale.\nA key part of the Company\u2019s business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and develop its product candidates. The Company may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships, which may significantly limit its ability to develop and commercialize its products successfully, if at all.\nA key part of the Company\u2019s business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and fund development of its product candidates. The Company is currently a party to several collaborative relationships.\nWhile the Company believes that these collaborative relationships help further validate our products, these relationships are not material to the Company because none of these relationships is exclusive, there are many potential collaborative partners available, and the Company and each collaborator is free to enter into other collaborative relationships as needed.\nThe Company may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all, and if it does enter into collaborations, these collaborations may not be successful. The Company\u2019s current and future success depends in part on its ability to enter into successful collaboration arrangements. If the Company is unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements, the Company may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of its product candidates, undertake development and commercialization activities at its own expense or find alternative sources of capital. Consequently, if it is unable to enter into, maintain or extend successful collaborations, the Company\u2019s business may be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s long-term success may depend upon the successful development and commercialization of products other than its current products.\nThe Company\u2019s long-term viability and growth may depend upon the successful development and commercialization of products other than its current line of products. Product development and commercialization is very expensive and involves a high degree of risk. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. Product development is a complex and time-consuming process. If the Company fails to adequately manage the research, development, execution and regulatory aspects of new product development it may fail to launch new products altogether.\nWe could be negatively impacted by the recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19).\nIn light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), this public health concern could pose a risk to our customers, our employees, our vendors and the communities in which we operate, which could negatively impact our business. Additionally, the State of California issued a Statewide Executive Order on March 19, 2020, which could impact our operations materially in the short term. The extent to which the coronavirus (COVID-19) may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. We could experience customer or widespread shutdowns to prevent spread of the virus, employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures, all of which could negatively impact our business. We intend to continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies and practices as more information and guidance become available.\nGovernment agencies may establish usage guidelines that directly apply to the Company\u2019s products or proposed products or change legislation or regulations to which the Company is subject.\nGovernment usage guidelines typically address matters such as usage and dose, among other factors. Application of these guidelines could limit the use of the Company\u2019s products and products that the Company may develop. In addition, there can be no assurance that government regulations applicable to the Company\u2019s products or proposed products or the interpretation thereof will not change and thereby prevent the marketing of some or all of its products for a period of time or permanently. The FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could modify, prevent, delay or change the regulatory approval required of the Company\u2019s products. The Company cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or in other countries.\nPatent litigation is common in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Any litigation or claim against the Company may cause it to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain on its financial resources, divert the attention of management from its business and harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nWhile the Company is not a pharmaceutical or a biopharmaceutical company, as a health sciences company, the Company\u2019s medical foods or its medical devices may come into competition with products in the medical foods and related industries, such as pharmaceuticals, biologics or dietary supplements. There has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights. For the most part, these lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability and infringement of patents. The Company expects it will rely upon patents, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position. The Company may find it necessary to initiate claims to defend its intellectual property rights as a result. Other parties may have issued patents or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of the Company\u2019s products or know-how or require the Company to license such patents and pay significant fees or royalties to produce its products. In addition, future patents may issue to third parties which the Company\u2019s technology may infringe. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which the Company is unaware that may later result in issued patents that the Company\u2019s products may infringe.\nIntellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If such a dispute were to be resolved against us, the Company may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees to the party claiming infringement if the Company were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent. The Company may also have to develop non-infringing technology, stop selling any products it develops, cease using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. The Company\u2019s failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm its business. Modification of any products the Company develops or development of new products thereafter could require the Company to become subject to other requirements of the FDA and other regulatory bodies, which could be time-consuming and expensive. In addition, parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent the Company from selling any products it develops, which could harm its business.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors may develop products similar to the Company\u2019s medical foods, medical devices and nutraceuticals, and the Company may therefore need to modify or alter its business strategy, which may delay the achievement of its goals.\nCompetitors may develop products with similar characteristics to our products. Such similar products marketed by larger competitors could hinder the Company\u2019s efforts to penetrate the market.\nMany large competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing experience and resources than we do and represent substantial long-term competition for us. Such companies may develop products that are safer, more effective or less costly than any that we may develop. Such companies also may be more successful than we are in manufacturing, sales and marketing.\nAs a result, the Company may be forced to modify or alter its business and regulatory strategy and sales and marketing plans, as a response to changes in the market, competition and technology limitations, among others. Such modifications may pose additional delays in achieving the Company\u2019s goals.\nIf the Company is unable to develop its own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or if it is not successful in contracting with third parties for these services on favorable terms, or at all, revenues from product sales could be limited.\nThe Company currently has a sales force consisting of a sales manager and four salespeople. To commercialize our products successfully, we have to develop more robust capabilities internally or collaborate with third parties that can perform these services for us. In the process of commercializing our products, we may not be able to hire the necessary experienced personnel and build sales, marketing and distribution operations capable of successfully launching new products and generating sufficient product revenues. In addition, establishing such operations takes time and involves significant expense.\nIf the Company decides to enter into co-promotion or other licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be unable to identify acceptable partners because the number of potential partners is limited and because of competition from others for similar alliances with potential partners. Even if we are able to identify one or more acceptable partners, we may not be able to enter into any partnering arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. If we enter into any partnering arrangements, our revenues are likely to be lower than if we marketed and sold our products ourselves.\nIn addition, any revenues the Company receives would depend upon our partners\u2019 efforts which may not be adequate due to lack of attention or resource commitments, management turnover, and change of strategic focus, further business combinations or other factors outside of our control. Depending upon the terms of our agreements, the remedies we have against an under-performing partner may be limited. If we were to terminate the relationship, it may be difficult or impossible to find a replacement partner on acceptable terms, or at all.\nProduct liability lawsuits against the Company could divert its resources and could cause it to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of Company products.\nWe face a risk of product liability exposure related to the use of our products, including Lumega-Z, GlaucoCetin and the NutriGuard product line of nutraceuticals. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we develop;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf loss of revenue; and\n\u25cf reduced time and attention of our management to pursue our business strategy.\nOur insurance policies may not fully cover liabilities that we may incur in the event of a product liability lawsuit. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nThe Company may be unsuccessful in expanding its product distribution outside the United States.\nTo the extent we begin to offer our products outside the United States, we expect that we may be dependent on third-party distribution relationships. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations. If distributors do not perform adequately, or we are unable to locate distributors in particular geographic areas, our ability to realize long-term international revenue growth would be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our products may require regulatory clearances and approvals from jurisdictions outside the United States. We expect that we will be subject to and required to comply with local regulatory requirements before selling our products in those jurisdictions. We are not certain that we will be able to obtain these clearances or approvals or compliance requirements on a timely basis, or at all.\nManufacturing risks and inefficiencies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to produce products.\nWe engage third parties to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, while maintaining product quality, acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with regulatory requirements. In determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we require. If we are unable to obtain from one or more of our vendors the needed materials or components that meet our specifications on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products. While we have not arranged for alternate suppliers, and it may be difficult to find alternate suppliers in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us, we believe that there are multiple alternative sources, suppliers and manufacturers available for our products and devices in the event of a termination or a disagreement with any current vendor. Additionally, our supply chain may be jeopardized for a period of time due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information and expose it to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and business partners, including personally identifiable information of our customers, some of which is stored on our network and some of which is stored with our third-party E-commerce vendor. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our network and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe Company\u2019s products and facility and the facilities of its manufacturers are subject to federal laws and regulations and certain requirements in the State of California. Failure to comply with any law or regulation could result in penalties and restrictions on the Company\u2019s manufacturers\u2019 ability to manufacture and the Company\u2019s ability to distribute products. If any such action were to be imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAlthough medical foods do not require pre-market approval by the FDA, manufacturers of medical foods must be registered with the FDA under a provision promulgated by the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (the \u201cBioterrorism Act\u201d). Manufacturers of medical foods are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA. The manufacture of our medical foods is outsourced in its entirety to three third-party manufacturers. We are evaluating additional manufacturers for selection as second source or back-up providers. Our medical foods have not been reviewed by the FDA. There is no certainty that the FDA will favorably review our medical food products or our manufacturers\u2019 facilities. If the outcome of an inspection is negative or if we or our manufacturers fail to comply with any law or regulation, we could be subject to penalties and restrictions on our manufacturers\u2019 ability to manufacture and distribute products. Any such action may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For a more complete discussion of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, see the section of this annual report titled \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s billings and revenues are derived from a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or more of them may have an immediate adverse effect on its financial results.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company\u2019s billings were derived from a limited number of individual customers and distributors. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Medical Devices segment had one customer who accounted for approximately 22% of the Company\u2019s sales; and during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Medical Devices segment had one customer who accounted for approximately 47% of the Company\u2019s sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in either year. Customers may stop purchasing our products with little or no warning. Loss of customers may have an immediate adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf the Company is forced to reduce its prices, its business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nThe Company may be subject to pricing pressures with respect to its future sales arising from various sources, including practices of health insurance companies, healthcare providers and competition in the marketplace. If the Company\u2019s pricing experiences significant downward pressure, our business could be less profitable, and our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, because cash from sales funds our working capital requirements, reduced profitability could require us to raise additional capital to support our operations.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully introduce new products or fails to keep pace with medical advances and developments, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe successful implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to evolving technologies and industry standards and introduce new products and services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce new products on schedule, or at all, or that such products will achieve market acceptance. Moreover, competitors may develop competitive products that could adversely affect our results of operations. A failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce these products on schedule may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, introduction of a new product that has similar or advances features over a current product may reduce interest and sales in the current product. There is no assurance that a new product will achieve the same or greater sales levels of a current product or that sales of a new product will replace or exceed the sales of a current product.\nIf we cannot adapt to changing technologies, our products and services may become obsolete, and our business could suffer. Because the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change, we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customers\u2019 requirements that could make our existing technology obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products, develop new technology that addresses the needs of our prospective customers, license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards, and, as a result, our business may suffer.\nIf customers do not accept the Company\u2019s products or delay in deciding whether to recommend the Company\u2019s products and services, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur business model depends on our ability to sell our products. Acceptance of our products requires physicians to use our MapcatSF to measure the macular protective pigment in their patients\u2019 eyes, understand and appreciate the benefits of Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin and nutraceuticals in order to recommend them to their patients, and to understand the benefits of visual acuity testing using the CSV-2000 device. We cannot assure you that physicians will integrate our products into their treatment plans or patient recommendations. Achieving market acceptance for our products and services will require substantial sales and marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry. If we fail to achieve broad acceptance of our products by physicians, and other healthcare industry participants or if we fail to position our products as an ocular health remedy, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf the Company\u2019s principal suppliers fail or are unable to perform their contracts with the Company, it may be unable to meet its commitments to its customers. As a result, the Company\u2019s reputation and its relationships with its customers may be damaged and its business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe currently purchase all our medical food ingredients and products from three vendors - one for carotenoids, one for Omega 3, and one for all other supplements. All of the ingredients for the nutraceutical products are sourced by the contract manufacturer that produces the NutriGuard products. These companies are subject to FDA regulation and they are responsible for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d as defined by the FDA). Although our agreements provide that our suppliers will abide by the FDA manufacturing requirements, we cannot control their compliance. If they fail to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements, the FDA could prevent our vendors from manufacturing our ingredients and products. Although we believe that there are a number of other sources of supply of ingredients and manufacturers of medical food products, if these suppliers are unable to perform under our agreements, particularly at certain critical times, we may be unable to meet our commitments to our customers. Additionally, if our suppliers are impacted by the recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), we may be unable to meet our commitments to our customers. If this were to happen, our reputation as well as our relationships with our customers may suffer and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. We are evaluating several additional manufacturers for selection as second source or back-up providers.\nIf the Company incurs costs exceeding its insurance coverage in lawsuits that are brought against it in the future, such incident may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we were to become a defendant in any lawsuits involving the manufacture and sale of our products and if our insurance coverage were inadequate to satisfy these liabilities, it would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company is deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, it could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing its products and services.\nWe could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and if our products or the functionality of our products overlap with patents of our competitors. While we do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us or that those claims will be unsuccessful. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims whether or not such claims are ultimately successful. Furthermore, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. In addition, we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its intellectual property rights, and if it is unable to protect them, its competitive position may suffer.\nOur business plan is predicated on our proprietary technology. Accordingly, protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position. Our goal is to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures. We generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position.\nOur success, competitive position, and future revenues will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes, and other technologies; to preserve our trade secrets; to obtain trademarks for our name, logo and products; to prevent third parties from infringing our proprietary rights; and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. To counter infringement or unauthorized use by third parties, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming.\nThe patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u25cf Claims of issued patents, and the claims of any patents which may be issued in the future and be owned by or licensed to the Company may be challenged by third parties, resulting in patents being deemed invalid, unenforceable, or narrowed in scope, a third party may circumvent any such issued patents, or such issued patents may not provide any significant commercial protection against competing products;\n\u25cf Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets; and\n\u25cf The legal systems of some foreign countries do not encourage the aggressive enforcement of patents, and countries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products. Thus, the Company\u2019s foreign patents may not be enforceable to the same extent as the counterpart U.S. patents.\nIn addition, the USPTO, and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or any of our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nThe Company must attract and retain quality management and employees in order to manage its growth. Failure to do so may result in slower expansion.\nIn order to support the growth of our business and the additional obligations that come with being an exchange-listed company, we will need to expand our senior management team and attract and retain quality employees. There is no assurance that we will be capable of attracting and retaining quality executives and integrating those individuals into our management system. Without experienced and talented management and employees, the growth of our business may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors may be impacted due to new state laws, including recently enacted gender quotas.\nIn September 2018, California enacted SB 826 requiring public companies headquartered in California to maintain minimum female representation on their boards of directors as follows: by the end of 2019, at least one woman on its board, by the end of 2020, public company boards with five members will be required to have at least two female directors, and public company boards with six or more members will be required to have at least three female directors. Failure to achieve designated minimum levels in a timely manner exposes such companies to financial penalties and reputational harm. We cannot assure that we can recruit, attract and/or retain qualified members of the board and meet gender quotas as a result of the California law, which may expose us to penalties and/or reputational harm.\nThe Company may consider acquiring other companies or product lines in an effort to expand its business in exchange for cash and/or stock of the Company (or a combination thereof), which may not be successful or which may cause dilution to investors.\nThe Company will consider acquiring other companies or product lines that may be complementary or supplementary as part of our future efforts to expand the business, which acquisitions could be for cash, stock or a combination thereof. There is no guarantee that any such acquisition will be successful or that an acquired company\u2019s products, operations or corporate culture will mesh with our Company, integrate well, or that any economies of scale will be realized. In addition, any such transaction that involves the Company\u2019s stock would cause dilution to investors. In addition, any such transaction that involves cash would result in a reallocation of funds on hand that would be needed to support an acquired company or acquired product line.\nIn order to expand the Company\u2019s business into additional jurisdictions, it may need to comply with regulatory requirements specific to such states and there can be no assurance that it will be able to initially meet such requirements or that it will be able to maintain compliance on an on-going basis.\nWhile we believe Lumega-Z\u00ae and Glauco-CetinTM to be medical foods and not drugs, they are only available under the supervision of a physician. While not available in pharmacies, we are mindful that the act of physicians prescribing, particularly if conducted across state lines, could potentially be subject to certain pharmacy regulations. Each state has its own regulations concerning physician dispensing, restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine, anti-kickback and false claims. In addition, each state has a board of pharmacy that regulates the sale and distribution of drugs and other therapeutic agents. Some states require a physician to obtain a license to dispense prescription products. While we do not believe these pharmacy requirements are applicable, should a pharmacy board or medical board determine otherwise, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the regulations of particular states into which we may expand or that we will be able to maintain compliance with the states in which we currently distribute our products. We currently have Lumega-Z customers in California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Mississippi, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Hawaii and Alberta, Canada. Our inability to maintain compliance with the regulations of California and these other jurisdictions or expand our business into additional states may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If it fails to comply with these laws, it could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, be precluded from developing manufacturing and selling certain products outside the U.S. or be required to develop and implement costly compliance programs, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business and may do business in the future, particularly as we expand our sales and operations to foreign markets. The Bribery Act, FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us, our officers, and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Compliance with the FCPA, in particular, is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nWe may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and we may participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. If we expand our operations outside of the U.S., we will need to dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United Kingdom and the U.S., and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. In addition, various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nWe may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The Securities and Exchange Commission also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions. Any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by U.K., U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Bylaws designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of state law actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nArticle XI of our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, or our Bylaws, dictates that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the sole and exclusive forum for certain state law based actions including certain derivative actions or proceedings brought on behalf of the Company; an action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by an officer, a director, employee or to the shareholders of the Company; any claim arising under Delaware corporate law; and any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws for which there is exclusive federal or concurrent federal and state jurisdiction.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company has no experience in conducting transcranial doppler ultrasound studies or selling nutraceuticals.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the new Transcranial Doppler Solutions, Inc. business or NutriGuard line of products will depend on its ability to attract qualified personnel and to successfully launch, market and advance a new service in an area where the Company has limited experience, which may be a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The Company may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to develop these businesses. The initiation process may disrupt its business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits of the new business service. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the initiation process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the new business could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the Company\u2019s operations and could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Industry\nAny failure to comply with all applicable federal and state privacy and security requirements for the protection of patient information may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, Title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the \u201cHITECH Act\u201d), and related regulations promulgated by the Secretary (\u201cHIPAA Regulations\u201d) grant a number of rights to individuals as to their identifiable confidential medical information (called \u201cProtected Health Information\u201d) and restrict the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information. Failure to comply with these confidentiality requirements may result in penalties and sanctions. In addition, certain state laws may impose independent obligations upon us with respect to patient-identifiable medical information. Moreover, various new laws relating to the acquisition, storage and transmission of patient medical information have been proposed at both the federal and state level. These laws (collectively, the \u201cState and Federal Privacy and Security Laws\u201d) present different risks as to two lines of business of the Company: (1) our sale of medical foods, and (2) our performance of Trans Cranial Doppler ultrasound (\u201cTCD\u201d) testing.\n1. Medical Foods: Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin. When a physician recommends one or more of the Company\u2019s medical foods to a patient, the Company typically receives an order from the customer, but does not usually receive medical information. As part of the operation of its business, it is possible, however, that during communication with customers or with physicians the Company might receive patient-identifiable medical information. To the extent the Company obtains access to Protected Health Information, it must ensure it complies with the State and Federal Privacy and Security Laws. Any failure to comply may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect its results of operations.\n2. The TCD Testing Business. In the TCD Testing line-of-business, the Company will go into physicians\u2019 offices and, as a vendor to the physicians, perform TCD tests on patients, as ordered by and under the supervision of the patients\u2019 treating physicians. Radiologists will read and report on the results of the tests, and the results will be reported back to the ordering/treating physician. The treating physician who orders the tests bill for the TCD tests to third party payors. During this process, the Company directly interacts with patients and has access to, processes and transmits Protected Health Information. As a result, the State and Federal Privacy and Security Laws will fully apply to the TCD testing business. As required by federal law, the Company has been putting into place a HIPAA compliance program, including providing training to staff, instituting appropriate Business Associate Agreements, implementing required policies and procedures, and conducting regular risk assessments. Any failure to comply with the requirements of the State and Federal Privacy and Security Laws - or any loss of Protected Health Information, whether inadvertent or not - may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with all applicable federal and state physician self-referral law (the \u201cStark Law\u201d) may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nCongress enacted significant prohibitions against physician self-referrals in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. This law and its supporting regulations, which have been amended and expanded substantially, are commonly referred to as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d and prohibit a physician from making any referral of a Stark Designated Health Service (\u201cDHS\u201d) to an entity with which the physician has any kind of financial relationship, unless all of the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception are met. Stark covered DHS include both outpatient prescription drugs and diagnostic testing that are reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have similar laws, some of which can apply to all payors and not just governmental payors. While the Company believes that its arrangements with its customers are in compliance with the federal and any state Stark Laws, the Stark Laws present different levels of risks as to three of the Company\u2019s lines of business: (1) sale of the Company\u2019s medical foods, (2) sale of the Company\u2019s medical devices; and (3) the Company\u2019s performance of TCD testing.\n1. Medical Foods and Medical Devices. These products are neither prescription drugs nor are they reimbursable under any federal program at present. Therefore, the Company believes that the federal Stark Law is not applicable. Further, the Company\u2019s believes that these products are also not covered under any potentially applicable state Stark Laws. The federal Stark Law, however, includes an exception for the provision of in-office ancillary services, including a physician\u2019s dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs, provided that the physician meets specified requirements. To the extent that the products might become reimbursable under a federal program, or otherwise become covered under the Stark Law, the Company believes that the physicians who use the Company\u2019s medical devices or recommend its medical foods to their patients are aware of these requirements. However, the Company does not monitor their compliance and has no assurance that the physicians are in material compliance with the Stark Law. If it were determined that the physicians who use the Company\u2019s medical device or prescribe medical foods purchased from the Company were not in compliance with Stark II, it could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n2. The TCD Testing Business. The TCD tests performed by the Company can be reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid and otherwise constitute a Stark covered DHS, which include diagnostic testing. In conducting TCD tests, the Company will be providing the tests to the ordering physician, who will be paying TCD as a vendor to perform the test on behalf of the physician; and the physician will then be billing for the test to third party payers, including potentially Medicare and Medicaid. As a result, the tests will be considered to be an in-office ancillary service covered under Stark. The Stark Law, however, includes an exception for the provision of such in-office ancillary services, provided that the physician meets specified requirements. The Company believes that the physicians who engage the Company as a vendor to perform the TCD tests are aware of these requirements. However, the Company does not monitor the physicians\u2019 compliance and has no assurance that the physicians are in material compliance with the Stark Law. If it were determined that the physicians were not in compliance with Stark, such could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company believe its current structure of its relationships with the ordering physicians to be in compliance with all of the requirements of applicable Stark Law exceptions. Any failure to comply the requirements of the Stark Law, however, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, and the future operations of the TCD business could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to comply with all applicable federal and state anti-kickback laws may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nThe federal anti-kickback statute (the \u201cAKS\u201d) applies to Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal programs. AKS prohibits the solicitation, offer, payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referrals or the purchase, or in return for recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase, of goods, including drugs, covered by the federal health care programs. At present, the Company does not participate in any federal programs and its products are not reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or any other state or federal program. The AKS is a criminal statute with criminal penalties, as well as potential civil and administrative penalties. The AKS, however, provides a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory \u201csafe harbors\u201d for particular types of transactions. Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws and their own anti-kickback laws, some of which can apply to all payors, and not just governmental payors. While the Company believes that it is in material compliance with both federal and state AKS laws, the AKS laws present different levels of risks as to three of the Company\u2019s lines of business: (1) sale of the Company\u2019s medical foods, (2) sale of the Company\u2019s medical devices, and (2) the Company\u2019s performance of TCD testing.\n1. Medical Foods and Medical Devices. At present, the Company\u2019s products are not reimbursable under any federal program. If, however, that changes in the future and it were determined that the Company was not in compliance with the AKS, the Company could be subject to liability, and its operations could be curtailed, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if the activities of its customers or other entity with which the Company has a business relationship were found to constitute a violation of the AKS and the Company, as a result of the provision of products or services to such customer or entity, were found to have knowingly participated in such activities, the Company could be subject to sanctions or liability under such laws, including civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as exclusion from government health programs. As a result of exclusion from government health programs, neither products nor services could be provided to any beneficiaries of any federal healthcare program.\n2. The TCD Testing Business. The TCD tests performed by the Company can be reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. As a result, the federal AKS (and potentially any applicable state anti-kickback law) will be implicated to the extent the financial relationships between the physician customers and the Company are (1) not set at a fair market value amount unrelated to the volume or value of TCD tests being ordered; or (2) were found to be a circumvention of the AKS through the creation of a suspect contractual joint venture. If the Company\u2019s arrangements with ordering physicians were found to constitute a violation of the federal AKS, or any applicable state anti-kickback law, we could be subject to sanctions or liability under such laws, including civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as exclusion from government health programs. As a result of exclusion from government health programs, neither products nor services could be provided to any beneficiaries of any federal healthcare program.\nAs to the nutraceuticals line of business, any failure to comply with applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations, including the DSHEA, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nUnlike pharmaceutical drugs and conventional foods, nutraceuticals are regulated as \u201cdietary supplements\u201d under the Dietary Supplement, Health and Education Act of 1994 (\u201cDSHEA\u201d) as a separate regulatory category of food. According to the FDA, a drug is an article intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease. While nutraceuticals are not intended to cure or treat disease, both dietary supplements and drugs are intended to affect the structure or function of the body. Dietary supplements that contain structure/function claims on their labels must bear the disclaimer: \u201cThis statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\u201d The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and truthfulness of these claims; they are not approved by FDA. Moreover, dietary supplements are supposed to enhance the diet, not be used as a conventional food or as the sole item of a meal or diet, and not supposed to be taken alone as a substitute for any food or medicine.\nAs to the TCD Testing line of business, any failure to comply with applicable federal and state documentation, coding and billing laws, rules and regulations, including the federal False Claims or similar state laws, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nThe Federal False Claims Act provides for the imposition of extensive financial penalties (including treble damages and fines of over $22,000 for every false claim) if a provider submits false claims to any governmental health program either knowingly or in reckless disregard or in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the claims at issue. Liability under the False Claims Act can arise from patterns of deficient documentation, coding and billing, as well as for billing for services that are deemed not to have been medically necessary for the treatment of the patient. Many states have their own False Claims Acts as well. The Company intends to bill governmental health care programs for the TCD testing, and the False Claims Act is thus potentially applicable to the Company\u2019s operations. Here, the Company will not be billing for the performance of the tests to governmental health care plans; the treating and ordering physician will. As a result, any patterns of uncorrected deficiencies in coding and billing for TCD tests by the physician could result in fines or other liabilities imposed on the physician. The imposition of such fines and penalties or an investigation into any alleged deficiencies by the physician could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with all state laws relating to the Corporate Practice of Medicine or fee splitting may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation.\nMany states prohibit or otherwise regulate under Corporate Practice of Medicine (\u201cCPOM\u201d) rules the extent to which non-licensed personnel may be involved in the practice of medicine or otherwise employ licensed personnel. Related state rules further limit the extent to which fees for professional services may be shared or \u201csplit\u201d between parties. Under the TCD Testing line of business, such rules in some states my impact the Company\u2019s relationship with the radiologists who will be reading and interpreting the results of the TCD tests, and thereby providing the \u201cprofessional component\u201d of such tests. In order to avoid such a potential impact, the Company is structuring its financial and billing relationships with such radiologists to be in compliance with applicable state rules by providing that the Company will not be billing for the \u201cprofessional component,\u201d which will be billed instead either by the treating and ordering physician or the radiologists themselves. Failure to comply with state CPOM and fee splitting rules, however, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased government involvement in healthcare could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nU.S. healthcare system reform under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and other initiatives at both the federal and state level, could increase government involvement in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the business environment of our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship. While no federal price controls are included in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act, any legislation that reduces physician incentives to dispense medications in their offices could adversely affect physician acceptance of our products. We cannot predict whether or when future healthcare reform initiatives at the federal or state level or other initiatives affecting our business will be proposed, enacted or implemented or what impact those initiatives may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship could react to these initiatives and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for our products. Additionally, government regulation could alter the clinical workflow of physicians, hospitals and other healthcare participants, thereby limiting the utility of our products and services to existing and potential customers and curtailing broad acceptance of our products and services. Additionally, new safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and corresponding exceptions to such law may alter the competitive landscape.\nRisks Related to The Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and it has elected to comply with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements which could make its common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we have elected to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which we refer to as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are only required to provide two years of audited financial statements. As a result of these reduced reporting and disclosure requirements our financial statements may not be comparable to SEC registrants not classified as emerging growth companies. We may be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the first sale our equity securities in a public offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, we would immediately cease to be an emerging growth company. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of our second annual report or the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other SEC registrants that are not emerging growth companies.\nInvestors may find our common stock less attractive as a result of our election to utilize these exemptions, which could result in a less active trading market for our common stock and/or the market price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nThe Company does not intend to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, so you may not receive any return on your investment in the Company prior to selling your interest in the Company.\nWe have never paid any dividends to our common stockholders and do not foresee doing so as a public company. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and, therefore, do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If we determine that we will pay cash dividends to the holders of our common stock, we cannot assure that such cash dividends will be paid on a timely basis. The success of your investment in the Company will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation. As a result, you will not receive any return on your investment prior to selling your shares in our Company and, for the other reasons discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, you may not receive any return on your investment even when you sell your shares in our Company.\nThe Company will require additional capital in the future to support its operations, and this capital has not always been readily available.\nWe will likely require additional debt or equity financing to fund our operations, including, but not limited to, working capital. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business model and future prospects. Accordingly, investors should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development, as we have, in fact, encountered. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a new company with a limited operating history and with limited funds, will face. In particular, while we do not have current plans to re-prioritize our business plan, potential investors should consider that there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:\n\u25cf implement or execute our current business plan, which may or may not be sound;\n\u25cf maintain our anticipated management and advisory team; and\n\u25cf raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to effectuate our business plan.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our existing capital stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our current operations and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited. If we cannot access the capital necessary to support our business, we would be forced to curtail our business activities or even shut down operations. If we cannot execute any one of the foregoing or similar matters relating to our business, the business may fail, in which case you would lose the entire amount of your investment in the Company.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which may divert from the Company\u2019s business operations.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition, proxy statement, and other information. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer need to certify that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. We will need to hire additional financial personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. As a result, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. Furthermore, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. In addition, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in order to comply with these requirements. We anticipate that these costs will materially increase our selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies. If we are unable to comply with the internal controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, then we may not be able to obtain the independent account certifications required by that act, which may preclude us from keeping our filings with the SEC current, and interfere with the ability of investors to trade our securities and our shares to be quoted or our ability to list our shares on any national securities exchange.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could cause our investors to lose confidence in us and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If our internal controls are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports in a timely manner. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, we concluded that there was material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that it is reasonably possible that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified a material weakness in our internal controls resulting from:\nSegregation of Duties - The Company did not maintain effective policies to ensure adequate segregation of duties within its accounting processes. Specifically, due to the size of the Company and the smaller nature of department teams, opportunities are limited to segregate duties, resulting in one individual having almost complete responsibility for the processing of certain financial information.\nWhile we have designed and implemented, or expect to implement, measures that we believe address or will address this control weakness, we continue to develop our internal controls, processes and reporting systems by, among other things, hiring qualified personnel with expertise to perform specific functions, and designing and implementing improved processes and internal controls, including ongoing senior management review and audit committee oversight. We plan to remediate the identified material weakness through the redistribution of job responsibilities, by hiring additional senior accounting staff, and through the design and implementation of additional internal controls in order to promote adequate segregation of duties. We expect to complete the remediation by the end of 2020. We expect to incur additional costs to remediate this weakness, primarily personnel costs. We may not be successful in implementing these changes or in developing other internal controls, which may undermine our ability to provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results. Further, we will not be able to fully assess whether the steps we are taking will remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting until we have completed our implementation efforts and sufficient time passes in order to evaluate their effectiveness. In addition, if we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. Moreover, in the future we may engage in business transactions, such as acquisitions, reorganizations or implementation of new information systems that could negatively affect our internal control over financial reporting and result in material weaknesses.\nIf we identify new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we may be late with the filing of our periodic reports, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. As a result of such failures, we could also become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and become subject to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could harm our reputation, financial condition or divert financial and management resources from our core business.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of its common stock.\nOn September 20, 2019, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that the closing bid price of our common stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days and that we no longer complied with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The notice provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until March 18, 2020, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nOn March 19, 2020, the Company received a written notification from Nasdaq that the Company has been granted an additional 180 calendar days, or until September 14, 2020, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nIf at any time before September 14, 2020, the bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock closes at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company has achieved compliance with the Rule. If compliance with the minimum bid price requirement cannot be demonstrated by September 14, 2020, Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company\u2019s common stock will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal Nasdaq\u2019s determination to a Hearings Panel.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, including the minimum bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. A delisting would adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume and likely the price of our common stock, causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the purchase price.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf changes in our industry;\n\u25cf competitive pricing pressures;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u25cf regulatory developments;\n\u25cf economic and other external factors;\n\u25cf period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u25cf the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock; and\n\u25cf any future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 18555, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "GHSI"}
