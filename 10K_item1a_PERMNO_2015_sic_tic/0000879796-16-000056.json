{"cik": "879796", "company": "ARI NETWORK SERVICES INC /WI", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-10-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we do not currently deem to be material also affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nContinued uncertain economic conditions or reduced investments in technology spending may negatively impact our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for technology services spending and on the economic health and general willingness of our current and prospective customers to make capital and expense commitments. If the conditions in the U.S. and global economic environment remain uncertain or continue to be volatile, or if they deteriorate further, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our customers sell capital goods, some of which are considered luxury in nature, which are highly dependent on the disposable income of end consumers. Weak or volatile economic conditions or a reduction in consumer spending may weaken our customers\u2019 demand for eCatalogs, lead management and eCommerce websites, business management software, digital marketing services and other technology-enabled services or their general information technology spending, which would likely harm our business and operating results in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, potential lower prices for our services, reduced sales and increased churn.\nWe may become liable to our customers and lose customers if we have defects or disruptions in our service or if we provide poor service.\nBecause we deliver some of our technology as a service, errors or defects in the software applications underlying our services or a failure of our hosting infrastructure may make our services, in particular our eCommerce services, unavailable to our customers. Since our customers use our eCommerce services to facilitate their sales, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our services, whether in connection with the day-to-day operation of our services, upgrades or otherwise, could damage our customers\u2019 businesses.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, the core of our network infrastructure is vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, equipment failure and other disruptive problems including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe and our users may experience interruptions in service as a result of the accidental or intentional actions of Internet users, current and former employees or others;\n\u00b7\nunauthorized access may jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems and our customers\u2019 computer systems, which may result in liability to our customers and also may deter potential customers;\n\u00b7\nwe may face liability for transmitting viruses to third parties that damage or impair their access to computer networks, programs, data or information;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience a denial-of-service (\u201cDoS\u201d) attack in an attempt to make our network unavailable to our customers, typically accomplished by flooding the targeted network with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled;\n\u00b7\nthere may be a systemic failure of Internet communications, leading to claims associated with the general unavailability of some of our products; or\n\u00b7\neliminating computer viruses and alleviating other security or technical problems may require interruptions, delays or cessation of service to our customers.\nIf we have any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our services, customers could elect not to renew, customers could delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers could make claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or litigation costs.\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our customers\u2019 information.\nA significant number of customers make purchases from us using credit cards. In order for our business to function successfully, we and other market participants must be able to handle and transmit confidential information, including credit card information, securely. There can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to operate our facilities and our customer service and sales operations in accordance with PCI or other industry recommended practices.\nFurther, there is increased litigation over personally identifiable information, and we may be subject to one or more claims or lawsuits related to intentional or unintentional exposure of our customer\u2019s personally identifiable information. Even if we are compliant with PCI standards, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving customer transaction data. Any breach could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites and choose not to purchase from us. If a computer hacker or other criminal is able to circumvent our security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, fines, litigation and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and harm our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft, including laws governing treatment of personally identifiable information. We collect and store personal information from consumers in the course of doing business. These laws have increased the costs of doing business, and if we fail to implement appropriate safeguards, or we fail to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies. If we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws, or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur core markets and verticals are competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nThe markets for eCatalogs, lead management and eCommerce websites, business management software, digital marketing services and other technology-enabled services targeted at our vertical markets are competitive, and the eCommerce area specifically, is rapidly changing with relatively low barriers to entry. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to remain intense. In addition, increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margin or the failure of our services to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance. Competition in our market is based principally upon service breadth and functionality; service performance, security and reliability; the ability to tailor and customize services for a specific company, vertical market or industry; ease of use of the service; speed and ease of deployment, integration and configuration; total cost of ownership, including price, implementation costs and support costs; professional services implementation; strength of customer relationships; and financial resources of the vendor. To compete effectively, we also must be able to more frequently update our services to meet market demand.\nOur larger principal competitors include Snap-on Business Solutions and PowerSports Network, owned by Dominion Enterprises. Some of our actual and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us such as greater name recognition within our target vertical markets, larger marketing budgets as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. If we are not able to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed.\nThe impact of negative factors on the business may not be immediately reflected in our financial results.\nBecause we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable agreement, non-renewal of subscriptions or reductions in new service agreements may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. The majority of our revenue in any given period is attributable to service agreements entered into during previous periods. A decline in new or renewed service agreements in any one period will not be fully reflected in our revenue in that period, but will reduce our revenue in future periods. As a result, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services in a particular period may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period because revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nWe expect that a portion of our revenue in the future will be derived from non-recurring fee income, which consists primarily of revenues from professional services such as software customization and training, software sales and one-time network installation fees. The timing of recording of this revenue is dependent upon several factors that we cannot predict. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe time required to close large license fee and development agreements, which can be delayed due to customer requirements and decision-making processes;\n\u00b7\nthe seasonality of certain sectors of the markets in which we operate;\n\u00b7\ndelays in the introduction of new products or services and their acceptance by customers; and\n\u00b7\ndelays in delivering customized software to our customers.\n\ufeff\nOur costs are not entirely predictable and may vary from quarter-to-quarter due to acquisitions or non-recurring expenditures. Cash flows may also vary from quarter to quarter, depending on the timing of disbursements and customer payments. These fluctuations may make period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations more complex.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and harm our operating results.\nA change in accounting standards or practices could harm our operating results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may harm our operating results or the way we conduct our business and may increase our compliance costs.\nOur business could suffer if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or become liable for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe regard our trademarks, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely upon trademark law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, strategic partners and others to protect our proprietary rights, but these measures can have only limited effectiveness. Prevalent use of the Internet has also increased the ease with which third parties can distribute our intellectual property without our authorization.\nWe intend to pursue the registration of our material trademarks as necessary. We may not be entitled to the benefits of any such registration until such registration takes effect. In addition, effective protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available. Further, we may be subject to claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us and our licensees.\nOther parties may assert claims of infringement of intellectual property or other proprietary rights against us. These claims, even if without merit, could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources. Furthermore, if claims like this were successful, we might be required to change our trademarks, alter our content, products or services, or pay financial damages, any of which could substantially increase our operating expenses. We also may be required to obtain licenses from others to refine, develop, market and deliver new services. We may be unable to obtain any needed license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and rights granted under any licenses may not be valid and enforceable. In the future, we could be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us and our licensees. Any such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are dependent on our management and employees.\nWe are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other key employees. There can be no assurance, however, that we can obtain executives of comparable expertise and commitment in the event of death, disability or voluntary departure of one of our executive officers or other key employees, or that our business would not suffer material adverse effects as the result of the death, disability or voluntary departure. Further, the loss of the services of any one or more of these employees could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we will also need to attract and retain other highly skilled technical and managerial personnel for whom competition is intense. If we are unable to do so, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur common stock has had limited trading.\nTrading in our common stock has historically been thin. Because of the thinness of the market for our stock, the price of our common stock may be subject to manipulation. This limited trading may adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts\u2019 and the media\u2019s coverage of us. As a result, there could be a larger spread between the bid and the ask prices of our common stock and investors may not be able to sell shares of our common stock when or at prices they desire.\nWe may not be able to identify, acquire and successfully integrate acquisitions.\nA key component of our growth strategy has been and will continue to be acquisitions and other business development opportunities that solidify or accelerate our market position in our core offerings and vertical markets. The successful implementation of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, finance the acquisitions and integrate their operations successfully into ARI. There can be no assurance that such candidates will be available or, if such candidates are available, that the price will be attractive or that we will be able to identify, acquire, finance or integrate such businesses successfully. In addition, in pursuing such acquisition opportunities, we may compete with other entities with similar growth strategies; these competitors may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than ARI. Competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets and/or a diminished pool of companies available for acquisition.\nThe successful integration of these acquisitions also may involve a number of additional risks, including: (i) the inability to retain the clients of the acquired business; (ii) the lingering effects of poor client relations or service performance by the acquired business, which also may taint our existing business; (iii) the inability to retain the desirable management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business; (iv) the inability to fully realize the desired efficiencies and economies of scale; (v) the inability to establish, implement or police ARI\u2019s existing standards, controls, procedures and policies in the acquired business; (vi) diversion of management attention; and (vii) exposure to client, employee and other legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition. In addition, any acquired business could perform significantly worse than expected.\nThe inability to identify, acquire, finance and successfully integrate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on ARI or its estimated or desired business, income, growth or other condition and results.\nFuture acquisitions, financing arrangements or exercise of outstanding options and warrants may result in dilution to existing shareholders.\nThe timing, size and success of acquisition efforts and any capital commitments cannot be readily predicted. Future acquisitions or investments may be financed by issuing shares of common stock, cash or a combination thereof. To the extent our common stock is used for all or a portion of the consideration to be paid for future acquisitions or investments, shareholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted.\nWe face risks with our international strategy.\nOur business strategy includes increasing our presence in markets outside the U.S. This strategy presents a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nmanaging more geographically diverse operations;\n\u00b7\ndealing with currency fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nincreased costs of operation;\n\u00b7\nonly having a small number of employees in these markets;\n\u00b7\nour dependence on value-added resellers and contractors to sell and service our products;\n\u00b7\na much smaller and more concentrated current customer base; and\n\u00b7\nassumption that U.S. international policy will remain favorable towards the countries in which we sell our products and services.\nOur historical losses have resulted in accumulated deficits on the consolidated balance sheet.\nWhile we have been profitable in recent years, we have experienced net losses in numerous fiscal years since our incorporation in 1981. These net losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $86,050,000 as of July 31, 2016. We may not be able to maintain or increase profitability in the future. As a result of these historical losses, our financial position has been weakened, and our ability to finance our growth may be constrained.\nOur unused net operating loss carryforwards could become impaired if we do not maintain profitability.\nWe have federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) of $2,023,000 as of July 31, 2016. We may not be able to generate sufficient, timely taxable income to utilize these before they expire. As a result, both net income and income tax liabilities could be negatively impacted.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on certain factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and product development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. Our future operating performance and financial results will be subject, in part, to factors beyond our control, including dealer bankruptcies in the vertical markets we serve, and general economic, financial and business conditions. We cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing facilities will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt, we may be required to:\n\u00b7\nrefinance all or a portion of our debt or obtain additional financing, neither of which can be assured and may be at terms that are less favorable than our current financing arrangements;\n\u00b7\nsell some of our assets or operations;\n\u00b7\nreduce or delay capital expenditures, research and development efforts and acquisitions; or\n\u00b7\nrevise or delay our strategic plans.\nIf we are required to take any of these actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments.", "PERMNO": 77082, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ARIS"}
