{"cik": "911650", "company": "Speed Commerce, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS / RISK FACTORS\nWe make written and oral statements from time to time regarding our business and prospects, such as projections of future performance, statements of management\u2019s plans and objectives, forecasts of market trends, and other matters that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Statements containing the words or phrases \u201cwill likely result,\u201d \u201care expected to,\u201d \u201cwill continue,\u201d \u201cis anticipated,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d or similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which may appear in documents, reports, filings with the SEC, including this Annual Report, news releases, written or oral presentations made by officers or other representatives made by us to analysts, shareholders, investors, news organizations and others and discussions with management and other representatives of us. For such statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nOur future results, including results related to forward-looking statements, involve a number of risks and uncertainties. No assurance can be given that the results reflected in any forward-looking statements will be achieved. Any forward-looking statement made by or on behalf of us speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made. Our forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that are sometimes based upon estimates, data, communications and other information from suppliers, government agencies and other sources that may be subject to revision. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update or keep current either (i) any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of such statement, or (ii) the important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or which are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement which may be made by or on behalf of us.\nIn addition to other matters identified or described by us from time to time in filings with the SEC, there are several important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or results that are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement that may be made by or on behalf of us. Some of these important factors, but not necessarily all important factors, include the following:\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nIf we fail to meet our significant working capital requirements or if our working capital requirements increase substantially, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe have significant working capital requirements, principally to procure licenses, finance accounts receivable, develop our technology infrastructure, fund technology development and staff our fulfillment and customer contact centers. Our working capital needs will increase in response to growth and/or seasonality. In addition, license advances, prepayments to enhance margins, investments and inventory increases to meet customer requirements could increase our working capital needs. The failure to obtain additional financing or maintain working capital credit facilities on reasonable terms in the future could adversely affect our business. In addition, if the cost of financing is too expensive or not available, it could require a reduction in our E-commerce and fulfillment activities.\nWe rely upon bank borrowings and vendor credit and payment terms to fund our general working capital and other needs and it may be necessary for us to secure additional financing in the future. If we were unable to borrow under our credit facility, obtain acceptable vendor terms or were otherwise unable to secure sufficient financing on acceptable terms or at all, our ability to grow or profit could be adversely affected.\nWe operate with significant levels of indebtedness and are required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants.\nAs of March 31, 2015, our total credit facilities outstanding, including debt and capital lease obligations was approximately $100.4 million, which was in excess of amounts permitted under our credit facility. We cannot provide assurance that our credit facilities will be renewed by the lending parties. Additionally, these credit facilities include both financial and non-financial covenants. We are now in compliance with these covenants, but cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants. A non-renewal, default under or acceleration of any of our credit facilities could have a material adverse impact upon our business and financial condition.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that, if not remediated, could result in material financial misstatements.\nAs disclosed in Item 9A, management identified a material weakness in our internal controls over the recording and reconciling of deferred costs regarding internal development costs due to the failure to use an adequate time-keeping system which required management use estimates that did not have adequate supporting documentation in a timely manner. We are in the process of implementing new controls to remediate this material weakness, but these new processes and controls have not yet been fully tested. If our remedial measures are insufficient and material errors should occur in the recording of these processes, our financial statements could contain material misstatements.\nWe may be unable to refinance our debt facility.\nWe currently have a $100 million term loan facility with our lender, which was made available and was fully funded to the Company, less certain fees and costs in November 2014. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity date November 21, 2019 of our credit facility. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness, obtain additional financing or comply with our lenders\u2019 requirements will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022\nour financial condition at the time;\n\u2022\nthe amount of financing outstanding and lender requirements at the time;\n\u2022\nrestrictions in our credit agreement or other outstanding indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nother factors, including the condition of the financial markets or the e-commerce and fulfillment markets.\nAs a result, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings or refinancings or proceeds of asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.\nWe are uncertain about the availability of additional capital.\nWe may require additional capital to take advantage of opportunities, including strategic alliances and acquisitions, and to fund capital expenditures and working capital needs, or to respond to changing business conditions and unanticipated competitive pressures. We may also require additional funds to finance operating losses. Should these circumstances arise, our existing cash balance and credit facility may be insufficient and we may need to raise additional funds either by borrowing money or issuing additional equity or both. We cannot assure you that such resources will be adequate or available for all of our future financing needs. Our inability to finance our growth, either internally or externally, may limit our growth potential and our ability to execute our business strategy.\nOur credit agreement contains significant restrictions that limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and includes other covenants. We may be unable to meet such ratios and covenants. Any of these restrictions may limit our ability to execute our business strategy. Moreover, if operating results fall below current levels, we may be unable to comply with these covenants. If that occurs, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness, in which case we may not be able to repay all of our indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current indebtedness level.\nThe level of our indebtedness could have important consequences. We and our subsidiaries could incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If we or our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, the related risks that we face could be magnified.\nWe may not be able to identify or complete any potential strategic transaction, including a sale of the Company, which may limit our success and profitability.\nOn April 16, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had formed a special committee to explore potential strategic alternatives, including a sale of the Company. Our inability to identify or complete such a strategic transaction could harm our long-term value for our shareholders, impact compliance with our credit facility, hinder our growth, result in the loss of key employees and/or result in increased volatility of our stock price. It could also have a material adverse impact upon our business and financial condition. Further, the potential impact of an announcement of a proposed strategic transaction on the market value of our common stock could have a deleterious effect.\nRecent and future acquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions have been an important element of our overall corporate strategy and we expect this to continue. We recently completed the acquisition of the assets of Fifth Gear, Inc. in November 2014. This transaction and any potential future transactions have been and could continue to be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating acquired companies, businesses, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n\u25cf\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges.\n\u25cf\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.\n\u25cf\nIntegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of operations, sales and marketing functions.\n\u25cf\nTransition of our operations and infrastructure as we seek to integrate existing operations with those of the acquired business.\n\u25cf\nThe acquired company may not produce revenue, earnings or business synergies as anticipated.\n\u25cf\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.\n\u25cf\nPotential loss of customers and vendors.\n\u25cf\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.\n\u25cf\nLitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former shareholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nIf we make acquisitions or divestitures, a significant amount of management\u2019s time and financial resources may be required to complete the acquisition or divestiture and integrate the acquired business into our existing operations or divest a business from our operations. Even with this investment of management time and financial resources, an acquisition may not produce the revenue, earnings or business synergies anticipated. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including assumption of unanticipated operating problems or legal liabilities, problems integrating the purchased operations, technologies or products, diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets that would reduce future reported earnings (goodwill impairments), ensuring acquired companies\u2019 compliance with the legal requirements and potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses. We cannot assure you that if we make any future acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances, joint ventures or divest a component of our business, that such transactions will be completed in a timely manner or achieve anticipated results, that they will be structured or financed in a way that will enhance our business or creditworthiness or that they will meet our strategic objectives or otherwise be successful. In addition, we may not be able to secure the financing necessary to consummate future acquisitions, and future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance of additional equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt, which could harm our financial condition or creditworthiness or result in dilution. Moreover, we may be unable to locate a suitable candidate with whom to accomplish an acquisition or divestiture, or may be unable to do so on terms favorable to us, which failure could negatively impact our profitability.\nThe completed divestiture of our distribution business may result in post-transaction payments or adjustments.\nIn July 2014, we divested our distribution business through an asset sale. The acquiring shareholders could also make indemnity claims against us under the indemnification provisions of the purchase agreement.\nWe may be the subject of lawsuits from the acquirer\u2019s shareholders related to the prior divestiture of our distribution business.\nIn July 2014 we divested our distribution business and we may be the subject of lawsuits from either the acquiring company\u2019s shareholders. Such lawsuits could result from the actions of the distribution business prior to the date of the divestiture, from actions after the divestiture or otherwise. Defending potential lawsuits could cost us significant expense and detract management\u2019s attention from the operation of our core business. Additionally, these lawsuits could result in the cancellation of or the inability to renew certain insurance coverage that would be necessary to protect our assets. We may also be the subject of lawsuits in connection with other aspects of our business beyond the sale of our distribution business.\nTo expand our business, we may incur significant expenses in the foreseeable future, which may reduce our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIn efforts to achieve our strategic plan to grow our business, we may increase operating and marketing expenses, as well as capital expenditures. We will need to generate additional profitable business to offset these expenses. If our revenue declines or grows slower than anticipated, or our operating and marketing expenses exceed our projections, we may not generate sufficient revenue to be profitable.\nOur revenue and gross margin is dependent upon our clients\u2019 business and transaction volumes and our costs; certain of our client service agreements are terminable by the client at will; we may incur financial penalties if we fail to meet contractual service levels under client service agreements.\nOur revenue is primarily transaction based and fluctuates with the volume of transactions or level of sales of the products by the clients for whom we provide transaction management services. If we are unable to retain existing clients or attract new clients or if we dedicate significant resources to clients whose business does not generate sufficient revenue or whose products do not generate substantial customer sales, our business may be materially adversely affected. Moreover, our ability to estimate service fee revenue for future periods is substantially dependent upon our clients\u2019 projections, the accuracy of which has been, and will continue to be, unpredictable. Therefore, our planning for client activity and targeted goals for service fee revenue and gross margin may be materially adversely affected by incomplete, delayed or inaccurate projections. In addition, certain of our service agreements with clients are terminable by the client at will. Therefore, we cannot make assurances that any of our clients will continue to use our services for any period of time. The loss of a significant amount of service fee revenue due to client terminations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to cover our costs and thus on our profitability. Certain of our client service agreements contain minimum service level requirements and impose financial penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. The imposition of a substantial amount of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our e-commerce and fulfillment business and operations.\nIf we fail to manage our technological infrastructure, our customers may experience service outages, which would impair existing and prospective client relationships and our business would be materially adversely affected.\nWe aim to maintain sufficient capacity in our technological infrastructure to meet the needs of our customers. We also seek to maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer deployments and the expansion of existing customer deployments. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, particularly in the fourth quarter of each calendar year when our customers\u2019 e-commerce sites experience significant increases in traffic, our customers could experience service outages. If we are not able to maintain an appropriate level of operating performance or our hosting infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with increased sales, we may be in breach of our client contractual obligations that may subject us to financial penalties and result in customer losses and could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth.\nOur revenue and margins may be materially impacted by client transaction volumes that differ from client projections and business assumptions.\nOur pricing for client transaction services, such as call center and fulfillment, is often based upon volume projections and business assumptions provided by the client and our anticipated costs to perform such work. In the event the actual level of activity or cost is substantially different from the projections or assumptions, we may have insufficient or excess staffing, incremental costs or other assets dedicated for such client that may negatively impact our margins and business relationship with such client. In the event we are unable to meet the service levels expected by the client, our relationship with the client may suffer and could result in financial penalties and/or the termination of the client contract.\nWe depend on third party shipping and fulfillment companies for the delivery of our products.\nWe rely almost entirely on arrangements with third party shipping and fulfillment companies, principally FedEx, for the delivery of our products. The termination of our arrangements with one or more of these third party shipping companies, or the failure or inability of one or more of these third party shipping companies to deliver products on a timely or cost efficient basis from suppliers to us, or products from us to our reseller customers or their end-user customers, would significantly disrupt our business and harm our reputation and net sales. Furthermore, an increase in amounts charged or the implementation of surcharges by these shipping companies could negatively affect our gross margins and earnings.\nWe subcontract a portion of our client services to third parties, and we are subject to various risks and liabilities if such subcontractors do not provide the subcontracted services or provide them in a manner that does not meet required service levels.\nWe currently, and may in the future, subcontract certain business services to one or more third parties. Under the terms of our contracts with our business service clients we are obligated to provide such subcontracted services and may be liable for the actions and omissions of such subcontractors. In the event a subcontractor fails to provide the subcontracted services in compliance with required services levels, or otherwise breaches its obligations, or discontinues its business, whether as the result of bankruptcy, insolvency or otherwise, we may be required to provide such services at a higher cost to us and may otherwise be liable for various costs and expenses related to such event. In addition, any such failure may damage our reputation and otherwise result in a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition.\nWe depend on a variety of systems for our operations, and a failure of these systems could disrupt our business and harm our reputation and net revenue and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe depend on a variety of systems for our operations. These systems support our operating functions, including inventory management, order processing, shipping, receiving and accounting. Certain of these systems are operated by third parties and their performance may be outside of our control. Any failures or significant downtime in our systems could prevent us from taking customer orders, printing product pick-lists, and/or shipping product. It could also prevent customers from accessing our price and product availability information.\nFrom time to time we may acquire other businesses having information systems and records, which may be converted and integrated into our information systems. This can be a lengthy and expensive process that results in a material diversion of resources from other operations. As our needs for technology evolve, we may experience difficulty or significant cost in upgrading or significantly replacing our systems.\nWe also rely on the internet for a portion of our orders and information exchanges with our customers. The internet and individual websites can experience disruptions and slowdowns. In addition, some websites have experienced security breakdowns. Our website could experience material breakdowns, disruptions or breaches in security. If we were to experience a security breakdown, disruption or breach that compromised sensitive information, this could harm our relationship with our customers or suppliers or result in claims. Disruption of our website or the internet in general could impair our order processing or more generally prevent our customers and suppliers from accessing information, which could cause us to lose business.\nOur inability to develop and maintain competitive customer information systems could cause our business and market share to suffer.\nWe believe customer information systems and product ordering and delivery systems, including internet-based systems, are becoming increasingly important in our business. Although we seek to enhance our customer information systems by adding new features, we offer no assurance that competitors will not develop superior customer information systems or that we will be able to meet evolving market requirements by upgrading our current systems at a reasonable cost, or at all. Our inability to develop and maintain competitive customer information systems could cause our business and market share to suffer.\nThe expansion of our business has inherent cybersecurity risks that may disrupt our business.\nOur strategic growth plans may increase our exposure to cybersecurity risks. A compromise of our security systems could result in a service disruption, or customers' personal information or our proprietary information being obtained by unauthorized users. Although we have implemented processes to mitigate the risk of security breaches and cyber incidents, there can be no assurance that such an attack will not occur. Any breach of our security could result in violation of privacy laws, potential litigation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, all of which could have a negative impact on our financial results and reputation.\nWe may not be able to recover all or a portion of our start-up costs associated with one or more of our clients.\nWe generally incur start-up costs in connection with the planning and implementation of business process solutions for our clients. Although we generally attempt to recover these costs from the client in the early stages of the client relationship, or upon contract termination if the client terminates without cause prior to full amortization of these costs, there is a risk that the client contract may not fully cover the start-up costs or that the client will terminate the contract for cause and withhold payment of any unamortized start-up costs. To the extent start-up costs exceed the start-up fees received, certain excess costs will be expensed as incurred. Additionally, in connection with new client contracts we generally incur capital expenditures associated with assets whose primary use is related to the client solution. There is a risk that the contract may end before expected and we may not recover the full amount of our capital costs.\nOur sales and implementation cycles are highly variable and our ability to finalize pending contracts may cause our operating results to vary widely.\nOur sales cycle is variable, typically ranging between several months to up to a year or longer from initial contact with the potential client to the signing of a contract. Occasionally the sales cycle requires substantially more time. Delays in signing and executing client contracts may affect our revenue and cause our operating results to vary widely. A potential client\u2019s decision to purchase our services is discretionary, involves a significant commitment of the client\u2019s resources and is influenced by intense internal and external pricing and operating comparisons. To successfully sell our services, we generally must educate our potential clients regarding the use and benefit of our services, which can require significant time and resources. Consequently, the period between initial contact and the purchase of our services is often long and subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval and competitive evaluation processes that typically accompany significant operational decisions. Additionally, the time required to finalize pending contracts and to implement our systems and integrate a new client can range from several weeks to many months. Delays in signing and integrating new clients may affect our revenue and cause our operating results to vary widely.\nIf our efforts to protect the security of customers, vendors, and other business information are unsuccessful, future issues could result in private litigation and investigations, and our sales and reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt, transmission and storage of information about our customers, vendors, and other business information. We have various security measures in place to protect this information and thwart data security incidents, however we may be unable to guard against new deceptive techniques aimed to breach our systems. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects that could compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or deceiving our employees. A party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary or confidential information or interrupt our operations. Any compromise or elimination of our security could reduce demand for our services. A potential data breach may bring private claims and investigations from state and federal agencies, including State Attorneys General, the Federal Trade Commission and the SEC. Such investigations may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our results of operations. If we experience significant data security breaches, our customers and vendors could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, which could cause them to discontinue using our services.\nWe may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to address any problem they may cause. Because our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, such as credit card numbers, security breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients, impact our ability to attract new clients, and we could be exposed to litigation and possible liability. Our security measures may not prevent security breaches, and failure to prevent security breaches may disrupt our operations. In certain circumstances, we do not carry insurance against the risk of credit card fraud and other fraud, so the failure to adequately control fraudulent transactions on either our behalf or our client\u2019s behalf could increase our expenses and diminish the value of our brand-name and our reputation.\nWe may be liable for misappropriation of our customers\u2019 and our clients\u2019 customers\u2019 personal information.\nData security laws are becoming more stringent in the United States and abroad. Third parties are engaging in increased cyber-attacks against companies doing business on the Internet and individuals are increasingly subjected to identity and credit card theft on the Internet. If third parties or unauthorized employees are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate our customers\u2019 or our clients\u2019 customers\u2019 personal information or credit card information, or if we give third parties or our employees\u2019 improper access to customers\u2019 personal information or credit card information, we could be subject to liability. This liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. This liability could also include claims for other misuses of personal information, including unauthorized marketing purposes. Liability for misappropriation of this information could decrease our profitability and adversely affect our business. In such circumstances, we also could be liable for failing to provide timely notice of a data security breach affecting certain types of personal information. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and state agencies have brought numerous enforcement actions against Internet companies for alleged deficiencies in those companies\u2019 privacy and data security practices, and they may continue to bring such actions. We could incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the collection, use or storage of personal information are introduced or if government agencies investigate our privacy or security practices.\nOur market is subject to rapid technological change and to compete we must continually enhance our systems to comply with evolving standards.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our services and the underlying infrastructure. If we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions, client requirements or emerging industry standards, our business could be adversely affected. The internet and e-commerce environments are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our technology and systems obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to both internally develop and license leading technologies to enhance our existing services and to develop new services. We must continue to address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. The development of proprietary technology involves significant technical and business risks. We may fail to develop new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards.\nOur revenues are dependent on the preferences and demand of our customers and, in many instances, their end-user customers, which can change at any time.\nOur business and operating results depend upon the appeal of our customer\u2019s products and services. A decline in the popularity of these products and services, or the failure of our customer\u2019s products and services to achieve and sustain market acceptance could result in reduced overall revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Consumer preferences are continuously changing, are difficult to predict and can vary over time.\nOur customer\u2019s failure to successfully anticipate, identify and react to consumer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and results of operations. In addition, changes in consumer preferences may cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly between comparable periods.\nA deterioration in the businesses or markets of significant customers, could harm our business.\nDuring weak economic times, there is an increased risk that certain of our customers will, among other things, reduce orders, delay payment for product purchased, or have fewer transactions. Our revenues could negatively be affected by a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe credit available to our customers;\n\u2022\nthe opening and closing of retail stores;\n\u2022\nproduct marketing and promotional activities; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic changes affecting the buying pattern of consumers, particularly those changes affecting consumer demand.\nIn addition, if a customer files for bankruptcy, we may be required to forego collection of pre-petition amounts owed and to repay amounts remitted to us during the 90-day preference period preceding the filing. The bankruptcy laws, as well as specific circumstances of each bankruptcy, may limit our ability to collect pre-petition amounts. Although we have sufficient reserves to cover our exposure resulting from anticipated customer difficulties, bankruptcies or defaults, we can provide no assurance that such reserves will be adequate. If they are not adequate, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business is seasonal and variable in nature and, as a result, the level of revenue and profitability during our peak season could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nTraditionally, our third quarter (October 1-December 31) has accounted for our largest quarterly revenue figures and a substantial portion of our earnings. Our third quarter accounted for 31.9% and 30.4% of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a service provider of end-to-end e-commerce and fulfillment solutions, our business is affected by the pattern of seasonality common to other suppliers of retailers, particularly during the holiday season. Because of this seasonality, if we or our customers experience a weak holiday season or poor weather conditions our financial results and liquidity could be negatively affected.\nGrowth of our non-U.S. sales and operations could subject us to additional risks that could harm our business.\nAlthough increasing in number, we have a limited number of customers in Canada, these customers expose us to foreign currency exchange risks because gain or loss on these activities is a function of the foreign exchange rate, over which we have no control. In addition, our non-U.S. operations are subject to a variety of risks, which could cause fluctuations in our results. These additional risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements;\n\u2022\nvariability of foreign economic, political and labor conditions;\n\u2022\nchanging restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements, tariffs or other trade barriers or by U.S. import and export laws;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with foreign laws; and\n\u2022\nas we generate cash flow in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we may experience difficulty transferring such funds to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner.\nAny one or more of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on insurance to mitigate some risks facing our business, and to the extent our insurance does not mitigate or our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nWe contract for insurance to cover certain potential risks and liabilities. It is possible that we may not be able to purchase enough insurance to meet our needs, may have to pay very high prices for the coverage we do obtain, have very high deductibles or may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire any insurance for certain types of business risk. In addition, not all of our contracts may limit our exposure for certain liabilities, such as data security claims or claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients. This could leave us exposed to potential claims. If we were found liable for a significant, underinsured or uninsured claim in the future, our operating results could be negatively impacted. Also, to the extent the cost of maintaining insurance increases, our operating results could be negatively affected. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that one or more of our insurers may become insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in the future. There can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to protect us from pending and future claims. In addition, we are required to maintain insurance coverage under some of our agreements with our clients. If we are not able to or do not maintain the required insurance coverage, we could breach those agreements.\nChanges in regulations, regulatory scrutiny, or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information. The interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux, and may vary from country to country. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among ourselves, our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations. Further, these laws continue to develop in ways we cannot predict and which may adversely impact our business. For example, new laws or regulations, in particular, financial or privacy laws or regulations, may be enacted in jurisdictions in which we do business that require data (including customer information, transaction data or other information) to be stored locally on servers in that jurisdiction and/or prohibit such data from being transmitted outside of that jurisdiction, which would increase our operational costs or capital expenditures and potentially impact the performance or availability of our services and/or our ability to use or process customer data.\nWe may not be able to successfully protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and other proprietary rights laws to protect the intellectual property we license. Third parties may try to challenge the ownership of such intellectual property by us or our licensors. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties infringing on our intellectual property rights or those of our licensors. If we need to resort to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights or those of our licensors, such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position.\nAs a result of current economic conditions, intellectual property we license may be subject to heightened non-litigation risks, as well, including the risk that our licensors or their parents, subsidiaries or affiliates may seek protection under bankruptcy laws. Although we believe that we would continue to retain our rights to license intellectual property in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that our rights or our licensors obligations (including any obligation to provide, among other things, updates to licensed intellectual property or software updates) would not be modified, reduced or eliminated in a bankruptcy proceeding. Such a result could significantly harm our business and financial results.\nIf third parties claim we or our clients are infringing their intellectual property rights, we could incur significant litigation costs, be required to pay damages, or change our business or incur licensing expenses.\nThird parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our business or the technologies we use infringe on their intellectual property rights. As a result, we or our clients may be subject to intellectual property legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert claims of infringement in the future or whether any future claims will prevent us from offering popular products or services. If we or our clients are found to infringe, we may be required to pay monetary damages, which could include treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for any infringement that is found to be willful, and either be enjoined or required to pay ongoing royalties with respect to any technologies found to infringe. Further, as a result of infringement claims either against us or our clients, we may be required, or deem it advisable, to develop non-infringing technology, which could be costly and time consuming, or enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable on terms that are acceptable, or at all. If a third party successfully asserts an infringement claim against us or our clients and we are enjoined or required to pay monetary damages or royalties or we are unable to develop suitable non-infringing alternatives or license the infringed or similar technology on reasonable terms on a timely basis, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed\nWe may incur liability for indemnification obligations under our contracts with our clients and business partners, which may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe include indemnification provisions in the contracts we enter into with our clients and business partners. Generally, the provisions require us to defend claims arising out of our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, breach of contractual obligations and/or unlawful or otherwise culpable conduct, including breach of data security. The indemnity obligations generally cover damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees arising out of such claims. In many instances, our indemnification obligations to our clients include the actions or omissions of our third-party service providers. Although we seek to limit our total liability under such provisions to either a portion of the value of the contract or a specified, agreed-upon amount, in some cases our total liability under such provisions is unlimited. Although in most cases our third party service providers indemnify us for their actions and omissions, such providers may dispute or be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligation to us. In addition, our indemnification obligation to our clients may be broader in scope, or may be subject to larger limitations of liability, than the indemnification obligation of our third party service providers to us. In most cases, the term of the indemnity provision is perpetual. If we are required to indemnify a claim in a material amount, or if a series of indemnification claims are in the aggregate a material amount, we may be required to expend significant resources to defend the claims, which may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDeterminations under government audits could negatively affect our business.\nWe provide services to U.S. government agencies under certain contracts that provide the agencies with the right to audit and review our performance under the contract, our pricing practices, our cost structure, and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. If a government audit determines that we are in breach of our contractual terms, or have engaged in improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of the contract, suspension of payments, or disqualification from continuing to do business, or bidding on new business, with this agency and other federal agencies.\nOur failure to diversify our business and customer base could harm us.\nOur efforts to diversify our business and customer base has placed, and will continue to place, demands on our personnel, as well as on our operational and financial infrastructure. To effectively manage our diversification efforts, we will need to continue to expand, improve and adapt our personnel, operations, infrastructure and our financial and information management systems and continue to implement adequate controls. These enhancements and improvements are likely to be complex and could require significant operating expenses, capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. We may also have to expand our management team by recruiting and employing additional experienced executives and employees. We may not be able to attract the talent necessary to effectively diversify our business into growing segments, and we may struggle to keep the talent currently employed and focused on diversification, if our compensation and benefits are not adequate or meet market demand. If we are unable to adapt our systems and business, put adequate controls in place and adapt our management team in a timely manner to accommodate our diversification, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers, the loss of which could adversely affect our business.\nHistorically, the majority of our revenue has come from a small number of customers purchasing our products and services. Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 42% of our revenue in fiscal 2015. Our largest customer in fiscal 2015 accounted for approximately 19% of our revenue and the customer terminated fulfillment services in April 2015. A customer or group of customers may stop utilizing our services for a number of reasons, including the acquisition of a customer by another company that has a different strategy with respect the sourcing of its e-commerce services needs. If this happens, our revenue could be greatly reduced, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe loss of key personnel could affect the depth, quality and effectiveness of our management team. In addition, if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, the depth, quality and effectiveness of our management team and employees could be negatively affected.\nWe depend on the services of our key personnel because of their experience in the e-commerce and fulfillment areas. The loss of the services of one or several of our key employees could result in the loss of customers or other important business relationships, or otherwise inhibit our ability to operate and diversify our business successfully.\nOur ability to enhance and develop markets for our current products and to introduce new products to the marketplace also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel. We compete for such personnel with other companies and organizations, many of which have substantially greater capital resources and name recognition than we do. If we are not successful in recruiting or retaining such personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain sufficient temporary and seasonal workers or if labor costs increase. In addition, recent healthcare legislation and related regulations could affect our cost of providing healthcare benefits adversely affecting our results and cash flows.\nWe regularly hire a large number of temporary, part-time and seasonal workers, particularly during the fourth quarter holiday season and to meet temporary increases in client activity volume related to customer short-term marketing programs. Any difficulty we may encounter in hiring such workers could result in significant increases in labor costs, or inability to support our clients\u2019 business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition for labor could substantially increase our labor costs. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and regulations that interpret the law contain provisions which could materially impact our future healthcare costs. While the legislation\u2019s ultimate impact is not yet known, it is possible that these changes could significantly increase our employee benefits costs which would adversely affect our results and cash flows. Although we seek to preserve the contractual ability to pass through increases in labor costs to our clients, not all of our current contracts provide us with this protection, and we may enter into contracts in the future which limit or prohibit our ability to pass through increases in labor costs to our clients.\nImpairment in the carrying value of our assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nWe recorded impairment charges to goodwill and other intangible assets of $18.8 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. We evaluate assets on the balance sheet whenever events or a change in circumstance indicates that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in additional asset impairment charges which could negatively affect our operating results and potentially result in future operating losses.\nWe may not be able to adequately adjust our business in a timely fashion in response to a decrease in net sales or an increase in our cost structure, which may cause our profitability to suffer.\nA significant portion of our selling, general and administrative expense is comprised of personnel, facilities and costs of invested capital. If we were to experience declines in our net revenue or an increase to our cost structure, we may not be able to exit facilities, reduce personnel, improve business processes, reduce inventory or make other significant changes to our business without significant disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs. Additionally, if management is not able to implement such actions in a timely manner, or at all, to offset a shortfall in net revenue and gross profit, our operating costs could suffer.\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive industries and compete with large national firms. Further competition, among other things, could reduce our sales volume and margins.\nMany companies offer, on an individual basis, one or more of the same services offered by our E-commerce and fulfillment business. We face competition from many different sources, depending upon the type and range of services requested by a potential client. Our competitors include vertical outsourcers, which are companies that offer a single function, such as call centers, public warehouses or credit card processors. We compete against transportation logistics providers who offer product management functions as an ancillary service to their primary transportation services. We also compete against other business process outsourcing providers, who perform many similar services. Some of our competitors are PFSWeb, Inc., Innotrac Corporation, Moduslink, Inc., Newgistics, Inc. and EBay Enterprise, Inc. Many of these companies have greater capabilities than we do for the single or multiple functions the competitors provide. In many instances, our competition is the in-house operations of our potential clients. The in-house operations of potential clients often believe that they can perform the same services we do, while others are reluctant to outsource business functions that involve direct customer contact. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against these or other competitors or competitive factors in the future.\nInterruption of our business or catastrophic loss at any of our facilities could lead to a curtailment or shutdown of our business.\nWe receive, manage, ship and process customer products and returns of such inventory from centralized distribution and fulfillment centers in Dallas, Texas, Columbus, Ohio, Louisiana, Missouri, and Hazle Township, Pennsylvania. An interruption in the operation of or in the service capabilities at these facilities as a result of equipment failure or other reasons could result in our inability to ship and process products, which would reduce our net sales and earnings for the affected period. In the event of a stoppage at such facilities, even if only temporary, or if we experience delays as a result of events that are beyond our control, delivery times to our customers or their customers and consumers and our relationship with such customers could be severely affected. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations and cause us to lose future sales. Our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, violent weather conditions or other natural disasters. We may experience a shutdown of our facilities or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failure, delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFuture terrorist or military actions could result in disruption to our operations or loss of assets.\nFuture terrorist or military actions, in the U.S. or abroad, could result in destruction or seizure of assets or suspension or disruption of our operations. Additionally, such actions could affect the operations of our suppliers or customers, resulting in loss of access to products, potential losses on supplier programs, loss of business, higher losses on receivables or inventory, or other disruptions in our business, which could negatively affect our operating results. We do not carry insurance covering such terrorist or military actions, and even if we were to seek such coverage and such coverage was available, the cost likely would not be commercially reasonable.\nIf one or more jurisdictions successfully assert that we should collect or should have collected sales or other taxes on the sale of our merchandise over the internet, our business could be harmed.\nThe application of sales tax or other similar taxes to interstate and international sales over the internet is complex and evolving. One or more local, state or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose past and future sales tax obligations on us or other out-of-state companies that engage in E-commerce. If one or more states or any foreign country successfully asserts that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise for which we are not currently collecting taxes, it could result in potentially material tax liability for past sales, decrease future sales and otherwise harm our business.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited.\nAs of March 31, 2015, we had estimated available federal net operating loss carry-forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of $152.4 million for federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2029. Our ability to use these NOLs will be dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income and may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d) imposes limitations on a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an \u201cownership change.\u201d In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. In the event of an ownership change, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. Any unused NOLs in excess of the annual limitation may be carried over to later years.\nChanges to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations.\nOur financial statements conform to United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in those policies or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results and could even affect our reporting of transactions that were completed before a change is announced. Financial reporting and accounting rules affect many aspects of our business, including rules relating to accounting for revenue recognition and operating leases, which are currently under review. Changes to those rules or interpretations of those rules, may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nBecause we currently fail to comply with NASDAQ requirements for continued listing, our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ, which would likely adversely affect our ability to address any short-term liquidity issues and hinder investors\u2019 ability to trade our common stock in the secondary market.\nOn April 6, 2015, we received a deficiency letter from NASDAQ notifying us that our common stock was subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Market because we are not in compliance with the minimum bid requirements set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(a) for continued listing. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(a) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share and NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirements exist if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive days. Our stock currently remains listed on the NSADAQ Global Market as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Per the deficiency letter, we have been provided until October 5, 2015 to regain compliance with this continued listing requirement, which would require us to maintain a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days.\nIf our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ, trading in our common stock would likely thereafter be conducted in the over-the-counter markets in the so-called pink sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, the liquidity of our common stock would likely be impaired, not only in the number of shares which could be bought and sold, but also through delays in the timing of the transactions, and there would likely be a reduction in the coverage of our company by securities analysts and the news media, thereby resulting in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise prevail. In addition, delisting would likely adversely affect our ability to address any short-term liquidity issues.\nFluctuations in our stock price could impair our ability to raise capital and make an investment in our securities undesirable.\nDuring fiscal 2015, the last reported price of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market ranged from a low of $0.64 to a high of $3.92. Our closing stock price as of June 12, 2015 was $0.30. We believe factors such as the market\u2019s acceptance of our business and products, our capital structure, the performance of our business relative to market expectations, as well as general volatility in the securities markets, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations, resulting in changes in the market prices of the stock of many companies, which may not have been directly related to the operating performance of those companies. Fluctuations in our stock price could impair our ability to raise capital and could make an investment in our securities undesirable.\nThe exercise of outstanding options may adversely affect our stock price.\nAs of March 31, 2015, options to purchase 4,091,726 shares of our common stock were outstanding, of which 1,708,517 options were exercisable as of that date. Our outstanding options are likely to be exercised at a time when the market price for our common stock is higher than the exercise prices of the options. If holders of these outstanding options sell the common stock received upon exercise, it may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe holders of our Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends in preference to the holders of our common stock.\nIn March 2015, we issued a total of 344,001.10 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for all the outstanding shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. Cumulative dividends accrue on shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at an annual rate of 5% and are payable quarterly in arrears, commencing on June 30, 2015. The dividend may be paid in additional shares of Series D Preferred Stock or in cash, at the Company\u2019s option. Also, upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, after the satisfaction of the debts of the Company and the payment of any liquidation preference owed to the holders of capital stock ranking prior to the Series D Convertible Preferred Stockholders, the holders of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to participate pari passu with the holders of our Common Stock (on an as converted basis) in the net assets of the Company.\nBecause of the potential for dividend or liquidation payment to which the holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are entitled, the amount available to be distributed to the holders of shares of our common stock upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company could be substantially limited or reduced to zero and may make it more difficult to raise capital or recruit and retain key personnel in the future.\nThe conversion of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock or the exercise of the warrants related to our Series A, Series B or Series D shares, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nEach share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into the number of shares of our common stock equal conversion price of $1.50 per share (subject to adjustment) and the Company has the right to force the conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in the event the common stock trades above $2.50 per shares (subject to adjustment) for 28 trading days in a 30 consecutive trading day period provided that the conversion shares have been registered pursuant to an effective registration statement and provided certain other conditions are met. Upon conversion, we must also pay any accrued but unpaid dividends. A holder of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock may elect to convert at any time. We have the right to force conversion of any then-outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, upon certain conditions being met. Our holders of Series C warrants to purchase our common stock may also do so in the event that our common stock trades above $3.50 per shares (subject to adjustment) for 28 trading days in a 30 consecutive trading day period provided that the warrant shares have been registered pursuant to an effective registration statement and provided certain other conditions are met. The holders of warrants related to our Series A and Series B shares may also choose to exercise their warrants if certain conditions are met. We also have the right to force the exercise of the warrants related to our Series A, Series B and Series D shares if certain other conditions are met.\nPublic sales of the shares of common stock acquired upon conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock or the exercise of the warrants, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise funds in additional stock financings.\nOur anti-takeover provisions, our ability to issue preferred stock and our staggered board may discourage takeover attempts that could be beneficial for our shareholders.\nWe are subject to Sections 302A.671 (Control Share Acquisitions) and 302A.673 (Business Combinations) of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, which may have the effect of limiting third parties from acquiring significant amounts of our common stock without our approval. These laws, among others, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from acquiring us or may serve as a barrier to shareholders seeking to amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws. Our articles of incorporation also permit us to issue preferred stock, which could allow us to delay or block a third party from acquiring us. The holders of preferred stock could also have voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock. Finally, our articles of incorporation and bylaws divide our board of directors into three classes that serve staggered, three-year terms. Each of these factors could make it difficult for a third party to effect a change in control of us. As a result, our shareholders may lose opportunities to dispose of their shares at the higher prices typically available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger or other proposal.\nIn addition, these measures may have the effect of permitting our current directors to retain their positions and place them in a better position to resist changes that our shareholders may wish to make if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our business.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, there may be no opportunity for our shareholders to achieve a return on their investment through dividend payments.\nWe currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Further, the payment of dividends by us is restricted by our credit facility and loan agreements. Consequently, shareholders should not expect an opportunity to achieve a return on their investment through dividend payments.\nOur directors may not be held personally liable for certain actions, which could discourage shareholder suits against them.\nMinnesota law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that our directors shall not be personally liable to us or our shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, with certain exceptions. These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by shareholders on behalf of us against a director. In addition, our bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Minnesota law.\nOther Risks\nOur business operates in a continually changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. It is not reasonable for us to itemize all of the factors that could affect us and/or the products and services or the distribution industry or the E-commerce and fulfillment industry as a whole. Future events that may not have been anticipated or discussed here could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThus, the foregoing is not a complete description of all risks relevant to our future performance, and the foregoing risk factors should be read and understood together with and in the context of similar discussions which may be contained in the documents that we file with the SEC in the future.", "PERMNO": 80001, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SPDC"}
