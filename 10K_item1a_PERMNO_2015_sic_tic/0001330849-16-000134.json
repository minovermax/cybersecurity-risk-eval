{"cik": "1330849", "company": "HERCULES OFFSHORE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and natural gas prices.\nOur business depends on the level of activity of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and internationally, and in particular, the level of exploration, development and production expenditures of our customers. Demand for our drilling services is adversely affected by declines associated with depressed oil and natural gas prices. Even the perceived risk of a decline in oil or natural gas prices often causes oil and gas companies to reduce spending on exploration, development and production. However, higher prices do not necessarily translate into increased drilling activity since our clients\u2019 expectations about future commodity prices typically drive demand for our services. Reductions in capital expenditures of our customers reduce rig utilization and dayrates. Oil and natural gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe demand for oil and natural gas in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe supply of oil and natural gas in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas, and the relative cost of onshore production or importation of natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical, economic and weather conditions in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nadvances in drilling, exploration, development and production technology;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly called \u201cOPEC,\u201d to set and maintain oil production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\nthe level of production in non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international tax policies and governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nthe development and exploitation of alternative fuels, and the competitive, social and political position of natural gas as a source of energy compared with other energy sources;\n\u2022\nthe policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe worldwide military and political environment and uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in the Middle East, North Africa, West Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and other significant oil and natural gas producing regions; and\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism or piracy that affect oil and natural gas producing regions, especially in Nigeria and the Middle East, where armed conflict, civil unrest and acts of terrorism are increasingly common occurrences.\nReduced demand for drilling and liftboat services has and could continue to materially erode dayrates and utilization rates for our units, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Continued hostilities in the Middle East, North Africa, West Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe, and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks against the United States or other countries could negatively impact the economies of the United States and other countries where we operate. A decline in the United States or global economy could result in a decrease in energy consumption and commodity prices, which in turn would cause our revenue and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects.\nThe offshore service industry is highly cyclical and experiences periods of low demand and low dayrates. The volatility of the industry has in the past resulted and could again result in sharp declines in our profitability.\nHistorically, the offshore service industry has been highly cyclical, with periods of high demand and high dayrates often followed by periods of low demand and low dayrates. Periods of low demand or increasing supply, both of which we are currently experiencing, intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs or liftboats being idle for long periods of time. As a result of the cyclicality of our industry, we expect our results of operations to be volatile and to decrease during market declines such as we are currently experiencing.\nAn increase in supply of rigs or liftboats could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew construction of rigs and liftboats, mobilization of rigs to regions in which we operate, or reactivation of non-marketed rigs and liftboats, could result in excess supply in the regions in which we operate, and our dayrates and utilization could be reduced.\nConstruction of rigs, including high specification rigs such as Hercules Highlander, Hercules Triumph and Hercules Resilience, could result in excess supply in international regions, which could reduce our ability to secure new contracts for our\nrigs and could reduce our ability to renew, extend or obtain new contracts for working rigs at the end of such contract term. The excess supply could also impact the dayrates on future contracts.\nIf market conditions improve, inactive rigs and liftboats that are not currently being marketed could be reactivated to meet an increase in demand. Improved market conditions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, particularly relative to other regions, could also lead to the movement of jackup rigs and other mobile offshore drilling units into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Improved market conditions in any region worldwide could lead to increased construction of rigs and liftboats and upgrade programs by our competitors. Some of our competitors have already announced plans to build additional jackup rigs with higher specifications than most of our fleet. Many of the rigs currently under construction have not been contracted for future work, which may intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur. A significant increase in the supply of jackup rigs, other mobile offshore drilling units or liftboats could adversely affect both our utilization and dayrates.\nWe have a significant level of debt, and could incur additional debt in the future. Our debt could have significant consequences for our business and future prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total outstanding debt of approximately $428.7 million. This debt represented approximately 43% of our total book capitalization. Our debt and the limitations imposed on us by our existing or future debt agreements could have significant consequences for our business and future prospects, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes and we may be required under the terms of our existing credit facility to use the proceeds of any financing we obtain to repay or prepay existing debt;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments of interest on our debt;\n\u2022\nwe may be exposed to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations on borrowings under our credit facility which could result in higher interest expense to the extent that we do not hedge such risk in the event of increases in interest rates;\n\u2022\nwe could be more vulnerable during downturns in our business and be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in our business and in market or industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nwe may have a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt.\nOur ability to service our debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our future cash flows may be insufficient to meet all of our debt obligations and other commitments, and any insufficiency could negatively impact our business. To the extent we are unable to make scheduled interest payments or repay our indebtedness as it becomes due or at maturity with cash on hand, we will need to refinance our debt, sell assets or repay the debt with the proceeds from equity offerings. Additional indebtedness or equity financing may not be available to us in the future for the refinancing or repayment of existing indebtedness, and we may not be able to complete asset sales in a timely manner sufficient to make such repayments.\nOur Board of Directors have formed a Special Committee to explore strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance with respect to the terms of timing of any transaction, or whether any transaction will ultimately occur, or will occur on terms favorable to our stockholders or lenders or to our business.\nWe recently announced the formation of a special committee (the \"Special Committee\") comprised of all the independent members of our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") to consider and explore various strategic alternatives potentially available to us in order to maximize our value. The formation of the Special Committee is not in response to any proposal we have received or an approach by a third party.\nThe Special Committee is authorized to explore, review, and evaluate any potential strategic transaction and any alternatives thereto, including, but not limited to, the sale of the Company, a merger or share exchange involving the Company, the sale of some or all of the Company's assets, and a recapitalization of the Company (whether by issuance of equity or debt securities, incurrence of additional indebtedness, or issuance of derivative securities thereof). No decision has been made to engage in any particular transaction or transactions. There can be no assurance that the Special Committee or the Board will authorize the pursuit of any strategic alternative. Moreover, there can be no assurance with respect to the terms or the timing of any transaction, or whether any transaction will ultimately occur. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nThere can be no assurance that the process of reviewing strategic alternatives will not have an adverse impact on our business. Current market conditions, including commodity prices, are unfavorable for our business and may constrain our ability to move forward with any possible dispositions or other strategic alternatives. There can be no assurances that we will\nbe able to identify or complete any strategic transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any such transaction would be favorable to our stockholders or lenders, or our business.\nIf we are unable to comply with the financial and other covenants in our Senior Secured Credit Facility, there could be a default, which could result in an acceleration of repayment of funds that we have borrowed.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facility includes financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity and, starting in the first quarter of 2017, the financial covenants will also require us to maintain a maximum ratio of debt relative to our EBITDA. Our ability to comply with these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control. Reduced activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry, such as we are currently experiencing, could adversely impact our ability to comply with such covenants in the future. Our failure to comply with the covenants in our Senior Secured Credit Facility would result in an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. An event of default could result in our having to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and in foreclosure of liens on our assets. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. However, we are currently projecting that we will violate the maximum ratio of debt relative to our EBITDA on March 31, 2017. If this occurs and we are not able to obtain a waiver from our lenders, the lenders could accelerate our debt obligations. In addition, we would be required to pay an additional premium of all interest that would accrue until November 6, 2018, plus a 3% premium, discounted to present value. Because of this applicable premium, it could be challenging for us to obtain a waiver, and further, given the current state of the drilling market, we do not currently believe refinancing would be a viable option. Our lenders may not support strategic alternatives considered by the Special Committee of our Board of Directors.\nOur liquidity depends upon cash on hand and cash from operations.\nOur liquidity depends upon cash on hand and cash from operations. Although we currently believe we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations through at least December 31, 2016, to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity offerings to fund operations, and under the terms of our existing indebtedness, we may be required to use the proceeds of any capital that we raise to repay existing indebtedness. Furthermore, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity offerings or asset sales to refinance our indebtedness, to fund capital expenditures or for general corporate purposes. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to access the capital markets when we need to or issue debt or equity on terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe are a holding company, and we are dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe currently conduct our operations through, and most of our assets are owned by, both U.S. and foreign subsidiaries, and our operating income and cash flow are generated by our subsidiaries. As a result, cash we obtain from our subsidiaries is the principal source of funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations. Contractual provisions or laws, as well as our subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and operating requirements, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries that we require to pay our debt service obligations. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to us by our subsidiaries to further taxation.\nThe inability to transfer cash from our subsidiaries may mean that, even though we may have sufficient resources on a consolidated basis to meet our obligations, we may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from subsidiaries to the parent company in order to provide funds for the payment of the parent company\u2019s obligations.\nMany of our customer contracts are short term, and our customers may seek to terminate, renegotiate or decline to renew contracts when market conditions decline, which could result in reduced profitability.\nCurrently, all of our drilling contracts with major customers are dayrate contracts, where we charge a fixed charge per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well. Likewise, under our current liftboat contracts, we charge a fixed fee per day regardless of the success of the operations that are being conducted by our customer utilizing our liftboat. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, contracts are generally short term, and oil and natural gas companies tend to reduce activity levels quickly in response to downward changes in oil and natural gas prices, such as we are currently experiencing. Due to the short-term nature of most of our contracts, a decline in market conditions such as we are currently experiencing can quickly affect our business if customers reduce their levels of operations. Also, during these periods of depressed market conditions, a customer may no longer need a rig or liftboat that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable rig or liftboat at a lower daily rate. As a result, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their existing contracts or avoid their obligations, including their payment obligations, under those contracts. In addition, our customers may have the right to terminate, or may seek to renegotiate, existing contracts if we experience downtime, operational problems above the contractual limit or safety-related issues, if the rig or liftboat is a total loss, if the rig or liftboat is not delivered to the customer within the period specified in the contract or in other specified circumstances, which include events beyond the control of either party.\nSome of our contracts with our customers include terms allowing them to terminate the contracts without cause, with little or no prior notice and without penalty or early termination payments. In addition, we could be required to pay penalties if some of our contracts with our customers are terminated due to downtime, operational problems or failure to deliver. Some of our other contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of a penalty, which may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Early termination of a contract may result in a rig or liftboat being idle for an extended period of time. The likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness such as we are currently experiencing. If our customers cancel or require us to renegotiate some of our significant contracts, if we are unable to secure new contracts on substantially similar terms, especially those contracts in our International Offshore segment, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time, our revenue and profitability would be materially reduced.\nOn February 25, 2015, we received a notice from Saudi Aramco terminating for convenience our drilling contract for the Hercules 261, effective on or about March 27, 2015. The Company received subsequent notices from Saudi Aramco extending the effective date of termination to May 31, 2015. On June 1, 2015, the Company received notice from Saudi Aramco reinstating the drilling contract on the Hercules 261, in exchange for dayrate concessions on the Hercules 261, Hercules 262 and Hercules 266 from their existing contracted rates to $67,000 per day. These reduced dayrates were effective retroactively from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 for the Hercules 261 and Hercules 262, and through the remaining contract term for the Hercules 266. However, on March 9, 2016, we received a notice from Saudi Aramco further reducing the dayrates under the contracts for the Hercules 261 and Hercules 262 from $67,000 per day to $63,650 per day. The reduced dayrates will apply retroactively from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. The dayrate for the Hercules 266 was also reduced from $67,000 per day to $63,650 per day effective January 1, 2016, through the remaining term of its contract, or April 7, 2016.\nWe can provide no assurance that our current backlog of contract revenue and receivables will be ultimately realized.\nAs of March 23, 2016, our total contract backlog for our Domestic Offshore, International Offshore and International Liftboats segments was approximately $829.1 million for our executed contracts, including approximately $410.9 million related to the Maersk contract for the newbuild jackup rig, Hercules Highlander, and accordingly, our financial prospects are significantly dependent upon our contract with Maersk. In addition, the total contract backlog assumes that the dayrates on the Hercules 261 and Hercules 262 revert back to their originally contracted dayrates effective January 1, 2017. We calculate our contract revenue backlog, or future contracted revenue, as the contract dayrate multiplied by the number of days remaining on the contract assuming full utilization, less any penalties or reductions in dayrate for late delivery or non-compliance with contractual obligations. Backlog excludes revenue for management agreements, mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. The amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenue is earned will be different than the backlog disclosed or expected due to various factors. We may not be able to perform under our drilling contracts due to various operational factors, including unscheduled repairs, maintenance, operational delays, health, safety and environmental incidents, weather events in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere and other factors (some of which are beyond our control), and our customers may seek to cancel or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons. In some of the contracts, our customer has the right to terminate the contract without penalty and in certain instances, with little or no notice. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our customers will pay any or all of the revenues that we have earned from them for providing our drilling and liftboat services. Our inability or the inability of our customers to perform under our or their contractual obligations may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our business is conducted in shallow-water areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The mature nature of this region could result in less drilling activity in the area, thereby reducing demand for our services.\nThe U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and in particular the shallow-water region of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, is a mature oil and natural gas production region that has experienced substantial seismic survey and exploration activity for many years. Because a large number of oil and natural gas prospects in this region have already been drilled, additional prospects of sufficient size and quality could be more difficult to identify. In addition, the amount of natural gas production in the shallow-water U.S. Gulf of Mexico has declined over the last decade. Moreover, oil and natural gas companies may be unable to obtain financing necessary to drill prospects in this region. The decrease in the size of oil and natural gas prospects, the decrease in production or the failure to obtain such financing may result in reduced drilling activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and reduced demand for our services.\nOur industry is highly competitive, with intense price competition. Our inability to compete successfully may reduce our profitability.\nOur industry is highly competitive. Our contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job, although rig and liftboat availability, location and technical capability and each contractor\u2019s safety performance record and reputation for quality also can be key factors in the determination. Dayrates also depend on the supply of rigs and vessels with excess capacity putting downward pressure on\ndayrates. Excess capacity can occur when newly constructed rigs and vessels enter service, when rigs and vessels are mobilized between geographic areas and when non-marketed rigs and vessels are reactivated.\nSeveral of our competitors also are incorporated in jurisdictions outside the United States, which provides them with significant tax advantages that are not available to us as a U.S. company and, as a result, may materially impair our ability to compete with them for many projects that would be beneficial to us.\nOur financial prospects are significantly dependent on our drilling contract for our newbuild rig, Hercules Highlander, and we cannot guarantee the timely completion and delivery of the Hercules Highlander, which is being constructed at JSL and is currently scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2016.\nWe may be materially adversely affected if our newbuild rig, Hercules Highlander, to support the drilling contract for Maersk Oil North Sea UK Limited (the \u201cMaersk Drilling Contract\u201d) is not constructed or delivered on time in accordance with the agreed specifications. Delayed delivery beyond December 31, 2016 will, unless the delay is for certain reasons permitted under the Maersk Drilling Contract (including certain instances of force majeure), give Maersk the right to terminate the Maersk Drilling Contract.\nOur rights under the construction contract may not protect us against the losses which may result if JSL is not able to deliver Hercules Highlander in accordance with the requirements of the construction contract and the Maersk Drilling Contract. We cannot give any assurance in respect of the yard\u2019s ability to complete the construction of Hercules Highlander as contractually agreed. In the event of such a failure or delay, we may not be able to generate any income from the Maersk Drilling Contract, which might lead to deferred or lost revenue, which is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. We could lose the Maersk Drilling Contract and/or receive potential liability claims from the customer as a result of such delays.\nWe may need to make changes to Hercules Highlander after delivery which could result in additional construction costs and additional capital needs for us in the future.\nWe cannot guarantee that Hercules Highlander will be completed or pass the acceptance tests.\nAcceptance tests will be performed in connection with the delivery of Hercules Highlander. The construction of Hercules Highlander was agreed to be based on an enhanced JSL JU-2000E design, and in accordance with detailed specifications and the rules and regulations of the classification society, the American Bureau of Shipping, as well as the relevant laws, regulations and rules of the intended flag state, Liberia, and of the countries in which Hercules Highlander is expected to operate. Such compliance will be pre-tested prior to departure from the shipyard in Singapore in order to reduce the risk for not meeting the performance specifications set out in the construction contract. Hercules Highlander will not be delivered from the yard until it is in compliance with the performance specifications, which could cause delivery to be delayed.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us or may be at a cost which reduces our cash flow and profitability.\nOur business is capital intensive and, to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt (which would increase our interest costs) or equity financings to execute our business strategy or to fund capital expenditures. Adequate sources of capital funding may not be available when needed or may not be available on acceptable terms. In addition, under the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, we may be required to use the proceeds of any capital that we raise to repay existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may be unable to fund the maintenance of our assets, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could harm our business.\nMaintaining idle assets or the sale of assets below their then carrying value may cause us to experience losses and may result in impairment charges.\nProlonged periods of low utilization and dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets or the sale of assets below their then carrying value may cause us to experience losses. These events may also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of our assets if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable or if we sell assets at below their then carrying value.\nAsset sales have been an important component of our business strategy. We may be unable to identify appropriate buyers with access to financing or to complete any sales on acceptable terms.\nWe are currently considering sales or other dispositions of our assets, and any such disposition could be significant and could significantly affect the results of operations of one or more of our business segments. Asset sales may occur on less favorable terms than terms that might be available at other times in the business cycle. At any given time, discussions with one or more potential buyers may be at different stages. Any such discussions and agreements to sell assets may or may not result in\nthe consummation of an asset sale. We may not be able to identify buyers with access to financing or complete sales on acceptable terms. In addition, our Senior Secured Credit Facility imposes certain restrictions and requirements on us with respect to asset sales, including approval by our lenders of certain asset sales. We may not be able to obtain lender approvals required for asset sales that we believe to be desirable, or our lenders may favor different strategic alternatives.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facility imposes significant additional costs and operating and financial restrictions on us, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking certain actions.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facility imposes significant additional costs and operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions to equity holders;\n\u2022\nprepay subordinated debt or unsecured debt;\n\u2022\nmake other restricted payments or investments (including investments in subsidiaries that are not guarantors);\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends or other transfers of assets by restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmodify or terminate any material agreement;\n\u2022\nengage in any new line of business; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur compliance with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures, finance our acquisitions, equipment purchases and development expenditures, or withstand the present or any future downturn in our business. Our lenders may not support strategic alternatives considered by the Special Committee of our Board of Directors, or our lenders may favor different strategic alternatives.\nOur international operations are subject to additional political, economic, and other uncertainties not generally associated with domestic operations.\nAn element of our business strategy is to continue to expand into international oil and natural gas producing areas such as West Africa, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and the North Sea. We operate liftboats in West Africa, including Nigeria, and in the Middle East. We also operate drilling rigs in Saudi Arabia, West Africa and Southeast Asia. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in any business operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability, war and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\npotential seizure, expropriation or nationalization of assets;\n\u2022\ndamage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees, including kidnappings and piracy;\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs;\n\u2022\ncomplications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations;\n\u2022\ndelays and potential prolonged disruption of operations associated with obtaining visas for our employees and other local procedural requirements and administrative matters;\n\u2022\nrepudiation, modification or renegotiation of contracts, disputes and legal proceedings in international jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nlimitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage in certain areas;\n\u2022\nimport-export quotas;\n\u2022\nconfiscatory taxation;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or strikes, particularly in Nigeria;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nwage and price controls;\n\u2022\nimposition of trade barriers;\n\u2022\nimposition or changes in enforcement of local content and cabotage laws, particularly in West Africa and Southeast Asia, where the legislatures are active in developing new legislation;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on currency or capital repatriations;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations and devaluations; and\n\u2022\nother forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control.\nMany governments favor or effectively require that liftboat or drilling contracts be awarded to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. In certain countries, government rules and regulations also require that local citizens or entities be engaged as local representatives to support the operations of foreign contractors or to own a portion of the equity or assets of companies operating within their jurisdiction. These practices and legal requirements regarding the use of and potential company equity and asset ownership by local representatives might limit our business and operations, and occasions may arise when we have disagreements with our local representative, or the continuation of such relationship may become infeasible. Any such developments might disrupt our operations and continuity of our business in such jurisdictions. If we are unable to resolve issues with a local representative, we may decide to terminate the relationship with such local representative and seek another local representative or seek opportunities for our rigs and vessels elsewhere. Where local representative relationships require approval from the local government or other third parties we may be constrained in our ability to replace an existing local representative which may disrupt our operations and continuity of our business in such jurisdictions and require us to seek opportunities for our rigs and vessels elsewhere. In addition, if we experience delays or are unable to perform our obligations under our contracts, our customers may seek to cancel the contracts, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur non-U.S. contract drilling and liftboat operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the equipment and operation of drilling rigs and liftboats, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and natural gas exploration and development, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel, employees and suppliers by foreign contractors, the ownership of assets by local citizens and companies, and duties on the importation and exportation of units and other equipment. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their countries. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do so. Operations in developing countries can be subject to legal systems which are not as predictable as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater risk and uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings. Our ability to compete in international markets may be adversely affected by these foreign governmental regulations and/or policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which nationals of those foreign countries have substantial ownership interests or by regulations requiring foreign contractors to employ, transfer ownership of equipment to, or purchase supplies from citizens of a particular jurisdiction.\nDue to our international operations, we may experience currency exchange losses when revenue is received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or when we do not hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. We may also incur losses as a result of our inability to collect revenue because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital.\nMany of our existing jackup rigs are at a relative disadvantage to higher specification rigs, which may be more likely to obtain contracts than lower specification jackup rigs such as ours.\nMany of our competitors have jackup fleets with generally higher specification rigs than those in our jackup fleet other than our three ultra-high specification rigs, including one under construction. In our existing fleet, 17 of our 27 jackup rigs are mat-supported, which are generally limited to geographic areas with soft bottom conditions like much of the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the majority of new rigs under construction are of higher specification than our existing fleet, other than our three ultra-high specification rigs, including one under construction. Most of these rigs under construction are currently without contracts, which may intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur. Particularly in periods in which there is decreased rig demand such as we are currently experiencing, higher specification rigs may be more likely to obtain contracts than lower specification jackup rigs such as ours. In the past, lower specification rigs typically have been stacked earlier in the cycle of decreased rig demand than higher specification rigs and have been reactivated later in the cycle, which may adversely impact our business. In addition, higher specification rigs may be more adaptable to different operating conditions and therefore have greater flexibility to move to areas of demand in response to changes in market conditions. Because a majority\nof our rigs were designed specifically for drilling in the shallow-water of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, our ability to move them to other regions in response to changes in market conditions is limited.\nFurthermore, there is an increasing amount of exploration and production expenditures being concentrated in deepwater drilling programs and deeper formations, including deep natural gas prospects, requiring higher specification jackup rigs, semisubmersible drilling rigs or drillships. This trend is expected to continue and could result in a decline in demand for lower specification jackup rigs like ours, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue and backlog, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years there has been a significant consolidation in our customer base. Therefore, we derive a significant amount of our revenue and backlog from a few energy companies. Saudi Aramco, Chevron Corporation, Arena Energy and Eni accounted for 34%, 10%, 10% and 15%, respectively, of our successor revenue for the period November 6, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and 21%, 19%, 16% and 7%, respectively, of our predecessor revenue for the period January 1, 2015 to November 6, 2015. In addition, our financial prospects are significantly dependent on our five-year contract with Maersk, which is scheduled to commence in the second half of 2016 and is projected to account for a significant portion of our backlog. Our financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected if any of these customers interrupt or curtail their activities, terminate or re-negotiate their contracts with us, fail to renew their existing contracts, refuse to award new contracts to us and we are unable to enter into contracts with new customers at comparable dayrates, or fail to pay for the revenues that we have earned providing our drilling and liftboat services. The loss of any of these or any other significant customer could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves numerous operating hazards and exposure to extreme weather and climate risks, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover our losses.\nOur operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling and operation of oil and natural gas wells, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, punchthroughs, craterings, fires and pollution, such as the well control incident experienced in July 2013 by our jackup drilling rig Hercules 265 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling or production operations, claims by the operator, severe damage to or destruction of the property and equipment involved, injury or death to rig or liftboat personnel, and environmental damage. We may also be subject to personal injury and other claims of rig or liftboat personnel as a result of our drilling and liftboat operations. Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal operating conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services and personnel shortages.\nIn addition, our drilling and liftboat operations are subject to perils of marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Tropical storms, hurricanes and other severe weather prevalent in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, damage to our rigs, liftboats, shorebases and corporate infrastructure caused by high winds, turbulent seas, or unstable sea bottom conditions could potentially cause us to curtail operations for significant periods of time until the damages can be repaired. In addition, we cold stack a number of rigs in certain locations offshore. This concentration of rigs in specific locations could expose us to increased liability from a catastrophic event and could cause an increase in our insurance costs.\nDamage to the environment could result from our operations, particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires. We may also be subject to property, environmental and other damage claims by oil and natural gas companies and other businesses operating offshore and in coastal areas. Our insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses, and we may not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. Moreover, pollution and environmental risks generally are subject to significant deductibles and are not totally insurable. Risks from extreme weather and marine hazards may increase in the event of ongoing patterns of adverse changes in weather or climate.\nOur customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us.\nConsistent with standard industry practice, our clients generally assume, and indemnify us against, well control and subsurface risks under dayrate contracts, regardless of how the loss or damages may be caused. Typically, our customer agrees to indemnify us for these risks, even if we are grossly negligent. However, since the Macondo well blowout and resulting litigation, some of our customers have been reluctant to extend their indemnity obligations in instances where we are grossly negligent. These risks are those associated with the loss of control of a well, such as blowout or cratering, the cost to regain control or redrill the well and associated pollution. There can be no assurance, however, that these clients will necessarily be financially able to indemnify us against all these risks. Also, we may be effectively prevented from enforcing these indemnities because of the nature of our relationship with some of our larger clients. Additionally, from time to time we may not be able to obtain agreement from our customers to indemnify us for such damages and risks.\nOur international operations may subject us to political and regulatory risks and uncertainties.\nIn connection with our international contracts, the transportation of rigs, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. In each jurisdiction, laws and regulations concerning importation, recordkeeping and reporting, import and export control and financial or economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. Our business and financial condition may be materially affected by enactment, amendment, enforcement or changing interpretations of these laws and regulations. Rigs and other shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result in failure to comply with existing laws and regulations and contractual requirements. Shipping delays or denials could cause operational downtime or increased costs, duties, taxes and fees. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations also could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from government contracts, seizure of goods and loss of import and export privileges.\nAcquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risk and may affect our operating results.\nWe have in the past completed acquisitions (including the acquisition of individual rigs and liftboats and our acquisitions of Seahawk in 2011 and Discovery Offshore S.A. in 2013), although we do not currently intend to pursue acquisitions. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, the potential unavailability of financial resources necessary to consummate acquisitions, difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition targets or in completing any transactions identified on sufficiently favorable terms.\nIn addition to the risks involved in identifying and completing acquisitions described above, even when acquisitions are completed, integration of acquired entities and assets can involve significant difficulties, such as:\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve cost savings or other financial or operating objectives with respect to an acquisition;\n\u2022\nuncertainties and delays relating to upgrades and refurbishments of newly-acquired rigs and liftboats;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain contracts or perform under contracts due to various operational factors, including unscheduled repairs, maintenance, operational delays, health, safety and environmental incidents, weather events and our new customers seeking to cancel or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons;\n\u2022\nstrain on the operational and managerial controls of our business;\n\u2022\nmanaging geographically separated organization, systems and facilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration and retention of customers or personnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies;\n\u2022\nassumption of unknown material liabilities or regulatory non-compliance issues;\n\u2022\npossible adverse short-term effects on our cash flows or operating results; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from the ongoing operations of our business.\nFailure to manage these acquisition risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any acquisitions or expansions, successfully integrate acquired entities or assets, or generate positive cash flow at any acquired company or expansion project.\nWe may consider future acquisitions and may be unable to complete and finance future acquisitions on acceptable terms. In addition, we may fail to successfully integrate acquired assets or businesses we acquire or incorrectly predict operating results.\nWe may consider future acquisitions which could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash, the incurrence of a substantial amount of debt or the issuance of a substantial amount of equity. In addition, we may not be able to obtain, on terms we find acceptable, sufficient financing or funding that may be required to fund any such acquisition or investment and related capital expenditures.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that any announcement or consummation of an acquisition would have on the trading price of our common stock.\nAny future acquisitions could present a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;\n\u2022\nthe risk of failing to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and timely; and\n\u2022\nthe risk of diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations or other priorities.\nIf we are unsuccessful in integrating our acquisitions in a timely and cost-effective manner, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFailure to retain or attract skilled workers could hurt our operations.\nWe require skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our rigs and liftboats. Shortages of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel could negatively affect the quality and timeliness of our work. In periods of economic crisis or during a recession, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining our skilled workers as these workers may seek employment in less cyclical or volatile industries or employers. In periods of recovery or increasing activity, we may have to increase the wages of our skilled workers, which could negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nAlthough our domestic employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the marine services industry has been targeted by maritime labor unions in an effort to organize U.S. Gulf of Mexico employees. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers or the unionization of our U.S. Gulf of Mexico employees could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nGovernmental laws and regulations, including those arising out of the Macondo well incident and those related to climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases, may add to our costs or limit drilling activity.\nOur operations are affected in varying degrees by governmental laws and regulations. We are also subject to the jurisdiction of the Coast Guard, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (\"BSEE\"), as well as private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping. New laws, regulations and requirements imposed after the Macondo well incident may delay our operations and cause us to incur additional expenses in order for our rigs and operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to be compliant with these new laws, regulations and requirements. These new laws, regulations and requirements and other potential changes in laws and regulations applicable to the offshore drilling industry in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may also prevent our customers from obtaining new drilling permits and approvals in a timely manner, if at all, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with laws and the applicable regulations and standards of governmental authorities and organizations. Moreover, the cost of compliance could be higher than anticipated. For example, the BSEE has extended its regulatory enforcement reach to include contractors, which exposes contractors to potential fines, sanctions and penalties for violations of law arising in the BSEE's jurisdictional area. Similarly, our international operations are subject to compliance with the FCPA, certain international conventions and the laws, regulations and standards of other foreign countries in which we operate. It is also possible that existing and proposed governmental conventions, laws, regulations and standards, including those related to climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases, may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or limit our activities or the activities and levels of capital spending by our customers.\nIn addition to the laws, regulations and requirements implemented since the Macondo well incident, the federal government has considered additional new laws, regulations and requirements, including those that would have imposed additional equipment requirements and that relate to the protection of the environment, which would be applicable to the offshore drilling industry in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The federal government may again consider implementing new laws, regulations and requirements. The implementation of new, more restrictive laws and regulations could lead to substantially increased potential liability and operating costs for us and our customers, which could cause our customers to discontinue or delay operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and/or redeploy capital to international locations. These actions, if taken by any of our customers, could result in underutilization of our U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets and have an adverse impact on our revenue, profitability and financial position.\nIn addition, as our vessels age, the costs of drydocking the vessels in order to comply with governmental laws and regulations and to maintain their class certifications are expected to increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with or a breach of environmental laws and regulations can be costly and could limit our operations.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign and/or international laws and regulations that require us to obtain and maintain specified permits or other governmental approvals, control the discharge of materials into the environment, require the removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. Governmental entities such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and\ncostly actions. For example, as an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in navigable U.S. waters and some offshore areas, we may be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills or other unauthorized discharges of chemicals or wastes resulting from those operations. Additionally, the BSEE has extended its regulatory enforcement reach to include contractors which exposes contractors to potential fines, sanctions and penalties for violations of law arising in the BSEE's jurisdictional area. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions restricting some or all of our activities in the affected areas. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years, and may in some cases impose strict liability, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Some of these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. The application of these requirements, the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new requirements, both in U.S. waters and internationally, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") or similar laws and regulations could result in significant expenses, divert management attention, and otherwise have a negative impact on us.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions. On April 4, 2011, we received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") requesting that we produce documents relating to our compliance with the FCPA. We were also advised by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") on April 5, 2011, that it was conducting a similar investigation. Under the direction of the audit committee, we conducted an internal investigation regarding these matters. On April 24, 2012 and August 7, 2012, we received letters notifying us that the DOJ and SEC, respectively, had completed their investigations and did not intend to pursue enforcement action against us. Despite the favorable termination of these investigations, we remain subject to the FCPA and similar laws and regulations, and any determination that we have violated the FCPA or laws of any other jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to maintain or replace our rigs and liftboats as they age.\nThe capital associated with the repair and maintenance of our fleet increases with age. We may not be able to maintain our fleet by extending the economic life of existing rigs and liftboats, and our financial resources may not be sufficient to enable us to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement units.\nOur operating and maintenance costs with respect to our rigs include fixed costs that will not decline in proportion to decreases in dayrates.\nWe do not expect our operating and maintenance costs with respect to our rigs to necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenue. Operating revenue may fluctuate as a function of changes in dayrate, but costs for operating a rig are generally fixed or only semi-variable regardless of the dayrate being earned. Additionally, if our rigs incur idle time between contracts, we typically do not de-man those rigs because we will use the crew to prepare the rig for its next contract. During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be immediate as portions of the crew may be required to prepare our rigs for stacking, after which time the crew members are assigned to active rigs or dismissed. Moreover, as our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, including mobilizations to harsh environments where high specification rigs such as the Hercules Triumph, Hercules Resilience and Hercules Highlander generally operate, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can increase significantly. In general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels and inflation. Equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment. Contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized.\nUpgrade, refurbishment and repair projects are subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns, which could have an adverse impact on our available cash resources and results of operations.\nWe make upgrade, refurbishment and repair expenditures for our fleet from time to time, including when we acquire units or when repairs or upgrades are required by law, in response to an inspection by a governmental authority or when a unit is damaged. We also regularly make certain upgrades or modifications to our drilling rigs to meet customer or contract specific requirements. Upgrade, refurbishment and repair projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, including costs or delays resulting from the following:\n\u2022\nunexpectedly long delivery times for, or shortages of, key equipment, parts and materials;\n\u2022\nshortages of skilled labor and other shipyard personnel necessary to perform the work;\n\u2022\nunforeseen increases in the cost of equipment, labor and raw materials used for our rigs, particularly steel;\n\u2022\nunforeseen design and engineering problems;\n\u2022\nlatent damages to or deterioration of hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022\nunanticipated actual or purported change orders;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\nfailure or delay of third-party service providers and labor disputes;\n\u2022\ndisputes with shipyards and suppliers;\n\u2022\ndelays and unexpected costs of incorporating parts and materials needed for the completion of projects;\n\u2022\nfailure or delay in obtaining acceptance of the rig from our customer;\n\u2022\nfinancial or other difficulties at shipyards, including shipyard incidents that could increase the cost and delay the timing of projects;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions; and\n\u2022\ninability or delay in obtaining customer acceptance or flag-state, classification society, certificate of inspection, or regulatory approvals.\nSignificant cost overruns or delays would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, capital expenditures for rig upgrade, reactivation and refurbishment projects could exceed our planned capital expenditures. Failure to complete an upgrade, reactivation, refurbishment or repair project on time may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling or liftboat contract and could put at risk our planned arrangements to commence operations on schedule. We also could be exposed to penalties for failure to complete an upgrade, refurbishment or repair project and commence operations in a timely manner. Our rigs and liftboats undergoing upgrade, reactivation, refurbishment or repair generally do not earn a dayrate during the period they are out of service.\nWe are subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe are from time to time involved in various litigation matters. The numerous operating hazards inherent in our business increase our exposure to litigation, including personal injury litigation brought against us by our employees that are injured operating our rigs and liftboats. These matters may include, among other things, contract dispute, personal injury, environmental, asbestos and other toxic tort, employment, tax and securities litigation, and litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. We have extensive litigation brought against us in federal and state courts located in Louisiana, Mississippi and South Texas, areas that were significantly impacted by hurricanes in the past and by the Macondo well blowout incident. The jury pools in these areas have become increasingly more hostile to defendants, particularly corporate defendants in the oil and gas industry. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter. Litigation may have an adverse effect on us because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated with defending the lawsuits, the diversion of our management\u2019s resources and other factors.\nOur operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight, and we depend upon the security and reliability of our technologies, systems and networks in numerous locations where we conduct business.\nWe continue to increase our dependence on digital technologies to conduct our operations, to collect monies from customers and to pay vendors and employees. In addition, we have outsourced certain information technology development, maintenance and support functions. As a result, we are exposed to cybersecurity risks at both our internal locations and outside vendor locations that could disrupt our operations for an extended period of time and result in the loss of critical data and in higher costs to correct and remedy the effects of such incidents, although no such material incidents have occurred to date. If our systems for protecting against information technology and cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by having our business and financial systems compromised, our proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or our business operations and safety procedures disrupted.\nChanges in effective tax rates, taxation of our foreign subsidiaries, limitations on utilization of our net operating losses or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial results.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally. From time to time, Congress and foreign, state and local governments consider legislation that could increase our effective tax rates. We cannot determine whether, or in what form, legislation will ultimately be enacted or what the impact of any such legislation would be on our profitability. If these or other changes to tax laws are enacted, our profitability could be negatively impacted.\nOur future effective tax rates could also be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ultimate repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the United States, or by changes in tax treaties, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof in one or more countries in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities where we file tax returns. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that any existing or future examinations by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and credit carry-forwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited as a result of issuances of equity or other transactions.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and certain tax credits, to offset future taxable income and tax. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders changes by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nThe Debtors' emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings is considered a change in ownership for purposes of IRC Section 382. The ownership changes and resulting annual limitation will result in the expiration of an estimated $60 million of net operating losses generated prior to the emergence date. Net operating losses, alternative minimum tax credits and certain built-in losses generated prior to the emergence date will be limited to $7.5 million per year. The amount of consolidated U.S. NOLs available as of December 31, 2015 is approximately $146.8 million. Additionally, we have $19.5 million of alternative minimum tax credits. These NOLs will expire in the years 2029 through 2035.\nWe have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock, so investors in our common stock may not receive funds without selling their shares.\nWe do not intend to declare or pay regular dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we generally intend to invest any future earnings in our business. Subject to Delaware law, our board of directors will determine the payment of future dividends on our common stock, if any, and the amount of any dividends in light of any applicable contractual restrictions limiting our ability to pay dividends, our earnings and cash flows, our capital requirements, our financial condition, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Our existing indebtedness restricts our ability to pay dividends or other distributions on our equity securities. Accordingly, stockholders may have to sell some or all of their common stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Stockholders may not receive a gain on their investment when they sell our common stock and may lose the entire amount of their investment.\nProvisions in our charter documents or Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware corporate law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable. These provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur publicly-filed reports are reviewed from time to time by the SEC, and the audits of our financial statements are subject to review by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Any significant changes or amendments required as a result of any such review may result in material liability to us and may have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe reports and other securities filings of publicly-traded companies are subject to review by the SEC from time to time for the purpose of assisting companies in complying with applicable disclosure requirements. The SEC is required, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to undertake a comprehensive review of a company\u2019s report at least once every three years, although an SEC review may be initiated at any time. Similarly, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) periodically reviews selected audits performed by independent registered accounting firms. While we believe that our previously filed SEC reports comply, and we intend that all future reports, including our audited financials, will comply, in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC and that the audits of our financial statements have been performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we could be required to modify, amend or reformulate information contained in our public filings as a result of an SEC or PCAOB review, or we may be found to have a significant deficiency or material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. Any modification, amendment or reformulation of information contained in our public filings could be significant and could result in material liability to us and have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to maintain our listing on NASDAQ, which would adversely affect the price and liquidity of our common stock.\nTo maintain the listing of our common stock on NASDAQ we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. Companies traded on NASDAQ would receive a deficiency notice from NASDAQ if their common stock has traded below the $1.00 minimum bid price for 30 consecutive business days. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, our common stock traded below the $1.00 minimum bid price for 18 consecutive trading days, however, our stock price as of March 28, 2016 was $2.20 per share. If our common stock trades below the $1.00 minimum bid price for 30 consecutive business days, we would likely receive a deficiency notice. Following receipt of a deficiency notice, we expect we would have 180 calendar days to regain compliance by having our common stock trade over the $1.00 minimum bid price for at least a 10-day period. If we were to fail to meet the minimum bid price for at least 10 consecutive days during the grace period, our common stock could be delisted. Even if we are able to comply with the minimum bid requirement, there is no assurance that in the future we will continue to satisfy NASDAQ listing requirements, which could result in our common stock being delisted. Delisting of our common stock could materially adversely affect the market price and market liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise necessary capital.", "PERMNO": 90951, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "HEROQ"}
