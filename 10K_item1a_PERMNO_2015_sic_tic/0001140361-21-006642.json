RISK FACTORS.\nOur business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. Some of these risks are described below, and readers of this Annual Report on Form 10-K should take such risks into account in evaluating our Company or making any decision to invest in us. This section does not describe all risks applicable to our Company, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of material factors affecting our business.\nRisks related to our business and operations\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the novel strain of coronavirus\n(\u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nOur operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as COVID-19 that has spread globally. Since February 2020, the continued spread has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of, and adversely impacts access to, capital and increases economic uncertainty. The pandemic has caused an economic slowdown of potentially extended duration, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession.\nCOVID-19 is having, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations and supply chains, including a temporary loss of physical therapists and other employees who are infected or quarantined for a period of time, an increase in cancellations of physical therapy patient appointments and a decline in the scheduling of new or additional patient appointments. Due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced, and will continue to experience, significant and unpredictable impact on employees and reductions and cancellations of our patient visits.\nImpact on the business and cash reserves resulting from retirement or resignation of key partners and resulting purchase of their non-controlling interests (minority interests)\nAs described in Note 5, the redeemable non-controlling interests in our partnerships are held by our partners. Upon the occurrence of certain events, such as retirement or other termination of employment, partners from acquired partnerships may have the right to exercise a \u201cput\u201d to cause us to purchase their redeemable non-controlling interests. Depending on the amount and timing of the exercise of any \u201cput\u201d rights, the funds required could have an adverse impact on our capital structure.\nHealthcare reform legislation may affect our business.\nIn recent years, many legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures that would affect major changes in the healthcare system, either nationally or at the state level. At the federal level, Congress has continued to propose or consider healthcare budgets that substantially reduce payments under the Medicare programs. See \u201cBusiness- Sources of Revenue\u201d in Item 1 for more information. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation and the impact of potential legislation on us is uncertain and difficult, if not impossible, to predict. That impact may be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to:\n\u2022 facility and professional licensure/permits, including certificates of need;\n\u2022 conduct of operations, including financial relationships among healthcare providers, Medicare fraud and abuse, and physician self-referral;\n\u2022 addition of facilities and services; and\n\u2022 billing and payment for services.\nIn recent years, there have been heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state government agencies relating to the healthcare industry. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all laws, but differing interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our methods of operations, facilities, equipment, personnel, services and capital expenditure programs and increase our operating expenses. If we fail to comply with these extensive laws and government regulations, we could become ineligible to receive government program reimbursement, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations. In addition, we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under these laws or regulations. For a more complete description of certain of these laws and regulations, see \u201cBusiness-Regulation and Healthcare Reform\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Compliance Program\u201d in Item 1.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to (1) facility and professional licensure, including certificates of need, (2) conduct of operations, including financial relationships among healthcare providers, Medicare fraud and abuse and physician self-referral, (3) addition of facilities and services and enrollment of newly developed facilities in the Medicare program, (4) payment for services and (5) safeguarding protected health information.\nBoth federal and state regulatory agencies inspect, survey and audit our facilities to review our compliance with these laws and regulations. While our facilities intend to comply with the existing licensing, Medicare certification requirements and accreditation standards, there can be no assurance that these regulatory authorities will determine that all applicable requirements are fully met at any given time. A determination by any of these regulatory authorities that a facility is not in compliance with these requirements could lead to the imposition of requirements that the facility takes corrective action, assessment of fines and penalties, or loss of licensure or Medicare certification of accreditation. These consequences could have an adverse effect on us.\nDecreases in Medicare reimbursement rates and payment reductions applied to the second and subsequent therapy services may adversely affect our financial results.\nThe Medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (\u2018\u2018MPFS\u2019\u2019). For services provided in 2018, a 0.5% increase was applied to the fee schedule payment rates; for services provided in 2019, a 0.25% increase was applied to the fee schedule payment rates before applying the mandatory budget neutrality adjustment. For services provided in 2020 through 2025, a 0.0% percent update is expected to be applied each year to the fee schedule payment rates, before applying the mandatory budget neutrality adjustment. However, in the 2020 MPFS Final Rule, CMS proposed an increase to the code values for office/outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) codes and cuts to other codes to maintain budget neutrality of the MPFS. Under the 2021 MPFS Final Rule, reimbursement for the codes applicable to physical/occupational therapy services were to be reduced by approximately 9% in the aggregate. The 9% reduction in payment was addressed by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (\u201cAct\u201d) signed into law on December 27, 2020. Based on various provisions in the Act, we now estimate that the Medicare rate reduction for the full year of 2021 will be approximately 3.5% in aggregate.\nBeginning in 2021, payments to individual therapists (Physical/Occupational Therapist in Private Practice) paid under the fee schedule may be subject to adjustment based on performance in the Merit Based Incentive Payment System (\u201cMIPS\u201d), which measures performance based on certain quality metrics, resource use, and meaningful use of electronic health records. Under the MIPS requirements, a provider's performance is assessed according to established performance standards each year and then is used to determine an adjustment factor that is applied to the professional's payment for the corresponding payment year. The provider\u2019s MIPS performance in 2019 will determine the payment adjustment in 2021. Each year from 2019 through 2024, professionals who receive a significant share of their revenues through an alternate payment model (\u201cAPM\u201d), (such as accountable care organizations or bundled payment arrangements) that involves risk of financial losses and a quality measurement component will receive a 5% bonus in the corresponding payment year. The bonus payment for APM participation is intended to encourage participation and testing of new APMs and to promote the alignment of incentives across payors. The specifics of the MIPS and APM adjustments will be subject to future notice and comment rule-making.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 increased the federal debt ceiling in connection with deficit reductions over the next ten years, and requires automatic reductions in federal spending by approximately $1.2 trillion. Payments to Medicare providers are subject to these automatic spending reductions, subject to a 2% cap. On April 1, 2013, a 2% reduction to Medicare payments was implemented. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, extended the 2% reductions to Medicare payments through fiscal year 2025. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, enacted on February 9, 2018, extends the 2% reductions to Medicare payments through fiscal year 2027. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act suspended the 2% payment reduction Medicare payments for dates of service from May 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 further suspended the 2% payment reduction until March 31, 2021.\nUnder the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (\u2018\u2018MCTRA\u2019\u2019), since October 1, 2012, patients who met or exceeded $3,700 in therapy expenditures during a calendar year have been subject to a manual medical review to determine whether applicable payment criteria are satisfied. The $3,700 threshold is applied to Physical Therapy and Speech Language Pathology Services; a separate $3,700 threshold is applied to the Occupational Therapy. The MACRA directed CMS to modify the manual medical review process such that those reviews will no longer apply to all claims exceeding the $3,700 threshold and instead will be determined on a targeted basis based on a variety of factors that CMS considers appropriate The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extends the targeted medical review indefinitely, but reduces the threshold to $3,000 through December 31, 2027. For 2028, the threshold amount will be increased by the percentage increase in the Medicare Economic Index (\u201cMEI\u201d) for 2028 and in subsequent years the threshold amount will increase based on the corresponding percentage increase in the MEI for such subsequent year.\nCMS adopted a multiple procedure payment reduction (\u2018\u2018MPPR\u2019\u2019) for therapy services in the final update to the MPFS for calendar year 2011. The MPPR applied to all outpatient therapy services paid under Medicare Part B - occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech-language pathology. Under the policy, the Medicare program pays 100% of the practice expense component of the Relative Value Unit (\u2018\u2018RVU\u2019\u2019) for the therapy procedure with the highest practice expense RVU, then reduces the payment for the practice expense component for the second and subsequent therapy procedures or units of service furnished during the same day for the same patient, regardless of whether those therapy services are furnished in separate sessions. Since 2013, the practice expense component for the second and subsequent therapy service furnished during the same day for the same patient was reduced by 50%. In addition, the MCTRA directed CMS to implement a claims-based data collection program to gather additional data on patient function during the course of therapy in order to better understand patient conditions and outcomes. All practice settings that provide outpatient therapy services are required to include this data on the claim form. Since 2013, therapists have been required to report new codes and modifiers on the claim form that reflect a patient\u2019s functional limitations and goals at initial evaluation, periodically throughout care, and at discharge. Reporting of these functional limitation codes and modifiers are required on the claim for payment.\nMedicare claims for outpatient therapy services furnished by therapy assistants on or after January 1, 2020 must include a modifier indicating the service was furnished by a therapy assistant. Outpatient therapy services furnished on or after January 1, 2022 in whole or part by a therapy assistant will be paid at an amount equal to 85% of the payment amount otherwise applicable for the service.\nStatutes, regulations, and payment rules governing the delivery of therapy services to Medicare beneficiaries are complex and subject to interpretation. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing that would have a material effect on the our financial statements as of December 31, 2020. Compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation, as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare program. For year ended December 31, 2020, net patient revenues from Medicare were approximately $101.6 million.\nGiven the history of frequent revisions to the Medicare program and its reimbursement rates and rules, we may not continue to receive reimbursement rates from Medicare that sufficiently compensate us for our services or, in some instances, cover our operating costs. Limits on reimbursement rates or the scope of services being reimbursed could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any delay or default by the federal or state governments in making Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement payments could materially and, adversely, affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect the federal and state governments to continue their efforts to contain growth in Medicaid expenditures, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nMedicaid spending has increased rapidly in recent years, becoming a significant component of state budgets. This, combined with slower state revenue growth, has led both the federal government and many states to institute measures aimed at controlling the growth of Medicaid spending, and in some instances reducing aggregate Medicaid spending. We expect these state and federal efforts to continue for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, not all of the states in which we operate, most notably Texas, have elected to expand Medicaid as part of federal healthcare reform legislation. There can be no assurance that the program, on the current terms or otherwise, will continue for any particular period of time beyond the foreseeable future. If Medicaid reimbursement rates are reduced or fail to increase as quickly as our costs, or if there are changes in the rules governing the Medicaid program that are disadvantageous to our businesses, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRevenue we receive from Medicare and Medicaid is subject to potential retroactive reduction.\nPayments we receive from Medicare and Medicaid can be retroactively adjusted after examination during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits. Payors may disallow our requests for reimbursement, or recoup amounts previously reimbursed, based on determinations by the payors or their third-party audit contractors that certain costs are not reimbursable because either adequate or additional documentation was not provided or because certain services were not covered or deemed to not be medically necessary. Significant adjustments, recoupments or repayments of our Medicare or Medicaid revenue, and the costs associated with complying with investigative audits by regulatory and governmental authorities, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, from time to time we become aware, either based on information provided by third parties and/or the results of internal audits, of payments from payor sources that were either wholly or partially in excess of the amount that we should have been paid for the service provided. Overpayments may result from a variety of factors, including insufficient documentation supporting the services rendered or medical necessity of the services or other failures to document the satisfaction of the necessary conditions of payment. We are required by law in most instances to refund the full amount of the overpayment after becoming aware of it, and failure to do so within requisite time limits imposed by the law could lead to significant fines and penalties being imposed on us. Furthermore, our initial billing of and payments for services that are unsupported by the requisite documentation and satisfaction of any other conditions of payment, regardless of our awareness of the failure at the time of the billing or payment, could expose us to significant fines and penalties. We, and/or certain of our operating companies, could also be subject to exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs in some circumstances as well, in addition to any monetary or other fines, penalties or sanctions that we may incur under applicable federal and/or state law. Our repayment of any such amounts, as well as any fines, penalties or other sanctions that we may incur, could be significant and could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time we are also involved in various external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, becoming subject to these governmental investigations, audits and reviews can also require us to incur significant legal and document production expenses as we cooperate with the government authorities, regardless of whether the particular investigation, audit or review leads to the identification of underlying issues.\nAs a result of increased post-payment reviews of claims we submit to Medicare for our services, we may incur additional costs and may be required to repay amounts already paid to us.\nWe are subject to regular post-payment inquiries, investigations and audits of the claims we submit to Medicare for payment for our services. These post-payment reviews have increased as a result of government cost-containment initiatives. These additional post-payment reviews may require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and to pursue the reversal of payment denials, and ultimately may require us to refund amounts paid to us by Medicare that are determined to have been overpaid.\nFor a further description of this and other laws and regulations involving governmental reimbursements, see \u201cBusiness-Sources of Revenue\u201d and \u201c-Regulation and Healthcare Reform\u201d in Item 1.\nAn economic downturn, state budget pressures, sustained unemployment and continued deficit spending by the federal government may result in a reduction in reimbursement and covered services.\nAn economic downturn, including the consequences of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, could have a detrimental effect on our revenues. Historically, state budget pressures have translated into reductions in state spending. Given that Medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets, we can expect continuing cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services in the states in which we operate. In addition, an economic downturn, coupled with sustained unemployment, may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs as well as the profitability of managed care companies, which could result in reduced reimbursement rates.\nThe existing federal deficit, as well as deficit spending by federal and state governments as the result of adverse developments in the economy or other reasons, can lead to continuing pressure to reduce governmental expenditures for other purposes, including government-funded programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Such actions in turn may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend upon reimbursement by third-party payors.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from private and governmental third-party payors. In 2020, approximately 68.4% of our revenues were derived collectively from managed care plans, commercial health insurers, workers\u2019 compensation payors, and other private pay revenue sources while approximately 31.6% of our revenues were derived from Medicare and Medicaid. Initiatives undertaken by industry and government to contain healthcare costs affect the profitability of our clinics. These payors attempt to control healthcare costs by contracting with healthcare providers to obtain services on a discounted basis. We believe that this trend will continue and may limit reimbursement for healthcare services. If insurers or managed care companies from whom we receive substantial payments were to reduce the amounts they pay for services, our profit margins may decline, or we may lose patients if we choose not to renew our contracts with these insurers at lower rates. In addition, in certain geographical areas, our clinics must be approved as providers by key health maintenance organizations and preferred provider plans. Failure to obtain or maintain these approvals would adversely affect our financial results.\nIn recent years, through legislative and regulatory actions, the federal government has made substantial changes to various payment systems under the Medicare program. See \u201cBusiness-Sources of Revenue\u201d in Item 1 for more information including changes to Medicare reimbursement. Additional reforms or other changes to these payment systems may be proposed or adopted, either by the U.S. Congress or by CMS, including bundled payments, outcomes-based payment methodologies and a shift away from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement. If revised regulations are adopted, the availability, methods and rates of Medicare reimbursements for services of the type furnished at our facilities could change. Some of these changes and proposed changes could adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results.\nWe face inspections, reviews, audits and investigations under federal and state government programs and contracts. These audits could have adverse findings that may negatively affect our business.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental inspections, reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. Managed care payors may also reserve the right to conduct audits. An adverse inspection, review, audit or investigation could result in:\n\u2022 refunding amounts we have been paid pursuant to the Medicare or Medicaid programs or from managed care payors;\n\u2022 state or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n\u2022 temporary suspension of payment for new patients to the facility or agency;\n\u2022 decertification or exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or one or more managed care payor networks;\n\u2022 expansion of the scope of our Corporate Integrity Agreement or the imposition of a new Corporate Integrity Agreement;\n\u2022 damage to our reputation;\n\u2022 the revocation of a facility\u2019s or agency\u2019s license\u037e and\n\u2022 loss of certain rights under, or termination of, our contracts with managed care payors.\nIf adverse inspections, reviews, audits or investigations occur and any of the results noted above occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur facilities are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations relating to the privacy of individually identifiable information.\nHIPAA required the HHS to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health-related information. The department released final regulations containing privacy standards in 2000 and published revisions to the final regulations in 2002. The privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health-related information. The regulations also provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed. The security regulations require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically. HITECH, which was signed into law in 2009, enhanced the privacy, security and enforcement provisions of HIPAA by, among other things establishing security breach notification requirements, allowing enforcement of HIPAA by state attorneys general, and increasing penalties for HIPAA violations. Violations of HIPAA or HITECH could result in civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition to HIPAA, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access or theft of personal information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state. Lawsuits, including class actions and action by state attorneys general, directed at companies that have experienced a privacy or security breach also can occur.\nWe have established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure compliance with these privacy related requirements. However, if there is a breach, we may be subject to various penalties and damages and may be required to incur costs to mitigate the impact of the breach on affected individuals.\nIn conducting our business, we are required to comply with applicable laws regarding fee-splitting and the corporate practice of medicine.\nSome states prohibit the \u201ccorporate practice of therapy\u201d that restricts business corporations from providing physical therapy services through the direct employment of therapist physicians or from exercising control over medical decisions by therapists. The laws relating to corporate practice vary from state to state and are not fully developed in each state in which we have facilities. Typically, however, professional corporations owned and controlled by licensed professionals are exempt from corporate practice restrictions and may employ therapists to furnish professional services. Those professional corporations may be managed by business corporations, such as the Company.\nSome states also prohibit entities from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians or therapists. The laws relating to fee-splitting also vary from state to state and are not fully developed. Generally, these laws restrict business arrangements that involve a physician or therapist sharing medical fees with a referral source, but in some states, these laws have been interpreted to extend to management agreements between physicians or therapists and business entities under some circumstances.\nWe believe that our current and planned activities do not constitute fee-splitting or the unlawful corporate practice of medicine as contemplated by these state laws. However, there can be no assurance that future interpretations of such laws will not require structural and organizational modification of our existing relationships with the practices. If a court or regulatory body determines that we have violated these laws or if new laws are introduced that would render our arrangements illegal, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable (in whole or in part), or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements with our affiliated physicians and other licensed providers.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis.\nWe are required to produce our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, to help mitigate the risk of fraud and to operate successfully. We are required by federal securities laws to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nTesting and maintaining our internal control over financial reporting can be expensive and divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to our business. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with applicable law, or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to issue an unqualified attestation report if we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified attestation report on our internal control, we could be required to take costly and time-consuming corrective measures, be required to restate the affected historical financial statements, be subjected to investigations and/or sanctions by federal and state securities regulators, and be subjected to civil lawsuits by security holders. Any of the foregoing could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and in us and would likely result in a decline in the market price of our stock and in our ability to raise additional financing if needed in the future.\nWe may be adversely affected by a security breach, such as a cyber-attack, which may cause a violation of HIPAA or HITECH and subject us to potential legal and reputational harm.\nIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data and other protected health information, which is subject to HIPAA and HITECH. We also contract with third-party vendors to maintain and store our patient\u2019s individually identifiable health information. Numerous state and federal laws and regulations address privacy and information security concerns resulting from our access to our patient\u2019s and employee\u2019s personal information.\nOur information technology systems and those of our vendors that process, maintain, and transmit such data are subject to computer viruses, cyber-attacks, or breaches. We adhere to policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with HIPAA and other privacy and information security laws and require our third-party vendors to do so as well. If, however, we or our third-party vendors experience a breach, loss, or other compromise of unsecured protected health information or other personal information, such an event could result in significant civil and criminal penalties, lawsuits, reputational harm, and increased costs to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, while our information technology systems, and those of our third-party vendors, are maintained with safeguards protecting against cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack that bypasses our information technology security systems, or those of our third-party vendors, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of protected health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information, operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of information technology systems and subsequent mitigation activities, or regulatory action taken as a result of such incident. We provide our employees training and regular reminders on important measures they can take to prevent breaches. We routinely identify attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems. However, given the rapidly evolving nature and proliferation of cyber threats, there can be no assurance our training and network security measures or other controls will detect, prevent, or remediate security or data breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access to, damage to, or interruption of our systems and operations. Accordingly, we may be vulnerable to losses associated with the improper functioning, security breach, or unavailability of our information systems as well as any systems used in acquired operations.\nWe depend upon the cultivation and maintenance of relationships with the physicians in our markets.\nOur success is dependent upon referrals from physicians in the communities our clinics serve and our ability to maintain good relations with these physicians and other referral sources. Physicians referring patients to our clinics are free to refer their patients to other therapy providers or to their own physician owned therapy practice. If we are unable to successfully cultivate and maintain strong relationships with physicians and other referral sources, our business may decrease and our net operating revenues may decline.\nWe depend upon our ability to recruit and retain experienced physical therapists.\nOur revenue generation is dependent upon referrals from physicians in the communities our clinics serve, and our ability to maintain good relations with these physicians. Our therapists are the front line for generating these referrals and we are dependent on their talents and skills to successfully cultivate and maintain strong relationships with these physicians. If we cannot recruit and retain our base of experienced and clinically skilled therapists, our business may decrease and our net operating revenues may decline. Periodically, we have clinics in isolated communities that are temporarily unable to operate due to the unavailability of a therapist who satisfies our standards.\nWe may also experience increases in our labor costs, primarily due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel, and such increases may adversely affect our profitability. Furthermore, while we attempt to manage overall labor costs in the most efficient way, our efforts to manage them may have limited effectiveness and may lead to increased turnover and other challenges.\nOur revenues may fluctuate due to weather.\nWe have a significant number of clinics in states that normally experience snow and ice during the winter months. Also, a significant number of our clinics are located in states along the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast which are subject to periodic winter storms, hurricanes and other severe storm systems. Periods of severe weather may cause physical damage to our facilities or prevent our staff or patients from traveling to our clinics, which may cause a decrease in our net operating revenues.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nWe encounter competition from local, regional or national entities, some of which have superior resources or other competitive advantages. Intense competition may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For a more complete description of this competitive environment, see \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d in Item 1. An adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations may require us to write down goodwill.\nWe may incur closure costs and losses.\nThe competitive, economic or reimbursement conditions in our markets in which we operate may require us to reorganize or to close certain clinics. In the event a clinic is reorganized or closed, we may incur losses and closure costs. The closure costs and losses may include, but are not limited to, lease obligations, severance, and write-down or write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nFuture acquisitions may use significant resources, may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue pursuing acquisitions of outpatient physical therapy clinics and industrial injury prevention businesses. Acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, potential debt incurrence and operational losses, dilutive issuances of equity securities and expenses that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022 the difficulty and expense of integrating acquired personnel into our business;\n\u2022 the diversion of management\u2019s time from existing operations\u037e\n\u2022 the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;\n\u2022 the difficulty of assignment and/or procurement of managed care contractual arrangements; and\n\u2022 the assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare regulations.\nRisks related to our common stock\nIssuance of shares in connection with financing transactions or under stock incentive plans will dilute current stockholders.\nPursuant to our stock incentive plans, our Compensation Committee of the Board, consisting solely of independent directors, is authorized to grant stock awards to our employees, directors and consultants. Shareholders will incur dilution upon the exercise of any outstanding stock awards or the grant of any restricted stock. In addition, if we raise additional funds by issuing additional common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock, further dilution to our existing stockholders will result, and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\nThe number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had reserved approximately 233,000 shares for future equity grants. We may issue additional restricted securities or register additional shares of common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), in the future. The issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options or the availability for sale, or sale, of a substantial number of the shares of common stock eligible for future sale under effective registration statements, under Rule 144 or otherwise, could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay, discourage, prevent or render more difficult an attempt to obtain control of our company, whether through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or otherwise. These provisions include the charter authorization of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and a restriction on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting.", "PERMNO": 77629, "SIC": 8000, "TIC": "USPH"}
