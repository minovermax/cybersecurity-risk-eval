{"cik": "1060349", "company": "GAMCO INVESTORS, INC. ET AL", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A:\nRISK FACTORS\nWe caution the reader that the following risks and those risks described elsewhere in this report and in our other SEC filings could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows or could cause a decline in the Company\u2019s stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe earn substantially all of our revenue based on assets under management and, therefore, a reduction in assets under management would reduce our revenues and profitability. Assets under management fluctuate based on many factors including market conditions, investment performance, and terminations of investment contracts.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are directly related to the amount of our AUM. Under our investment advisory contracts with our clients, the investment advisory fees we receive are typically based on the market value of AUM. In addition, we receive asset-based distribution fees with respect to the open-end Funds managed by Gabelli Funds or Teton and its affiliates over time pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of Rule 12b-1 under the Company Act. Rule 12b-1 fees typically are based on the average AUM and represented approximately 7.9% and 8.9% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Accordingly, a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our revenues and net income to decline by either causing the value of our AUM to decrease, which would result in lower investment advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees, or causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments they perceive to offer greater opportunity or lower risk, which would also result in lower fees. The securities markets are highly volatile, and securities prices may decrease for many reasons beyond our control, including, but not limited to, economic and political events, war (whether or not directly involving the U.S.), acts of terrorism, natural disasters, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, the yield curve, defaults by derivative counterparties, bond default risks, sovereign debt crisis, and other factors that are difficult or impossible to predict. If a decline in securities prices caused our revenues to decline, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Lastly, as we are a traditional asset manager, we do not receive additional revenue streams from alternative asset strategies such as hedge funds, private equity, or venture capital.\nChanges in laws or regulations or in governmental policies and compliance with existing laws or regulations could limit the sources and amounts of our revenues, increase our costs of doing business, decrease our profitability, and materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., primarily at the federal level, including regulation by the SEC under the Company Act and the Advisers Act as well as other securities laws, by the Department of Labor under ERISA, and regulation by FINRA and state regulators. The Funds managed by Gabelli Funds are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Company Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on investment advisors, including record-keeping, advertising and operating requirements, fiduciary and disclosure obligations, custodial requirements, and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Company Act imposes similar obligations, as well as additional detailed operational requirements, on registered investment companies and investment advisors. In addition, our businesses are also subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom, and we are also subject to the laws of other non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies or bodies.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of teammates, or other sanctions, including revocation of our subsidiaries\u2019 registrations as an investment advisor or broker-dealer. Industry regulations are designed to protect our clients and investors in our funds and other third parties who deal with us and to ensure the integrity of the financial markets. Our industry is frequently altered by new laws or regulations and by revisions to, and evolving interpretations of, existing laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and in other nations. Changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could limit the sources and amounts of our revenues including but not limited to distribution revenue under the Company Act, increase our costs of doing business, decrease our profitability, and materially and adversely affect our business.\nEvents outside of our control, including public health crises, could negatively affect the portfolios we manage and our results of our operations.\nPeriods of market volatility have occurred and could continue to occur in response to pandemics or other events outside of our control. These types of events have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect operating results for us and the portfolios that we manage. For example, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) surfaced in China and has since spread globally, which has resulted in restrictions on travel and congregation and the temporary closure of many non-essential businesses in affected jurisdictions, including, beginning in March 2020, in the U.S. In addition to these developments having adverse consequences for us and the portfolios that we manage, the operations of GAMCO could be adversely impacted, including through quarantine measures and travel restrictions imposed on its personnel or service providers based in affected countries, or any related health issues of such personnel or service providers. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 remains difficult to predict, including the extent to which COVID-19 could negatively affect our and our portfolio companies\u2019 operating results or the duration of any potential business disruption. Any potential impact to our results of operations will depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that could emerge regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19 and new virus variants and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain it or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our operating results.\nTo the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure.\nThe investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. To the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure. Although our investment advisory fees vary from product to product, historically we have competed primarily on the performance of our products and not on the level of our investment advisory fees relative to those of our competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry. In order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that make investors willing to pay our fees. In addition, the board of directors or trustees of each Fund managed by Gabelli Funds must make certain findings as to the reasonableness of its fees. We cannot be assured that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or new business could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from investment advisory contracts that may be terminated on short notice or may not be renewed by clients.\nA substantial majority of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements and distribution arrangements. Investment management agreements and distribution arrangements with the domestic Funds are terminable without penalty on 60 days\u2019 notice (subject to certain additional procedural requirements in the case of termination by a Fund) and must be specifically approved at least annually, as required by law. Such annual renewal requires, among other things, approval by the disinterested members of each Fund\u2019s board of directors or trustees. Investment advisory agreements with our Institutional and PWM clients are typically terminable by the client without penalty on 30 days\u2019 notice or less. Any failure to renew or termination of a significant number of these agreements or arrangements would have a material adverse effect on us.\nInvestors in the open-end Funds can redeem their investments in these Funds at any time without prior notice, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nOpen-end Fund investors may redeem their investments in those Funds at any time without prior notice. Investors may reduce the aggregate amount of AUM for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, and financial market performance. In a declining stock market, the pace of mutual fund redemptions could accelerate. Poor performance relative to other asset management firms tends to result in decreased purchases of open-end fund shares and increased redemptions of open-end fund shares. The redemption of investments in the Funds managed by Gabelli Funds would adversely affect our revenues, which are substantially dependent upon the AUM in our Funds. If redemptions of investments in the open-end Funds caused our revenues to decline, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nCertain changes in control of our company would automatically terminate our investment management agreements with our clients, unless our Institutional and PWM clients consent and, in the case of Fund clients, the Funds\u2019 boards of directors and shareholders vote to continue the agreements, and could prevent us for a two-year period from increasing the investment advisory fees we are able to charge our mutual fund clients.\nUnder the Company Act, an investment management agreement with a fund must provide for its automatic termination in the event of its assignment. The fund\u2019s board and shareholders must vote to continue the agreement following its assignment, the cost of which ordinarily would be borne by us. Under the Advisers Act, a client\u2019s investment management agreement may not be assigned by the investment advisor without the client\u2019s consent. An investment management agreement is considered to be assigned to another party when a controlling block of the advisor\u2019s ownership is transferred. In our case, an assignment of our investment management agreements may occur if, among other things, we sell or issue a certain number of additional common shares in the future. We cannot be certain that our clients will consent to assignments of our investment management agreements or approve new agreements with us if an assignment occurs. Under the Company Act, if a fund\u2019s investment advisor engages in a transaction that results in the assignment of its investment management agreement with the fund, the advisor may not impose an unfair burden on that fund as a result of the transaction for a two-year period after the transaction is completed. The term \u201cunfair burden\u201d has been interpreted to include certain increases in investment advisory fees. This restriction may discourage potential purchasers from acquiring a controlling interest in our company.\nCatastrophic and unpredictable events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA terrorist attack, cyber-attack, political unrest, war (whether or not directly involving the U.S.), power failure, technology failure, natural disaster, or many other possible catastrophic or unpredictable events could adversely affect our future revenues, expenses, and earnings by, among other things: causing disruptions in U.S., regional or global economic conditions; interrupting our normal business operations; inflicting teammate casualties, including loss of our key executives; requiring substantial expenditures and expenses to repair, replace, and restore normal business operations; and reducing investor confidence.\nWe have a disaster recovery plan to address certain contingencies, but it cannot be assured that this plan will be effective or sufficient in responding to, eliminating, or ameliorating the effects of all disaster scenarios. If our teammates or vendors we rely upon for support in a catastrophic event are unable to respond adequately or in a timely manner, we may lose clients resulting in a decrease in AUM, which may have a material adverse effect on revenues and net income.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect our business.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We and the investments we manage may have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us, or the accounts we manage, to credit risk in the event of the counterparty\u2019s default. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nControl by Mr. Gabelli of a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock may give rise to conflicts of interests.\nSince our IPO in 1999, Mr. Gabelli, through his control and majority ownership of GGCP, has beneficially owned a majority of our outstanding Class B Stock, currently representing approximately 96% of voting control. As long as Mr. Gabelli indirectly beneficially owns a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, he will have the ability to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and thereby control our management and affairs, including determinations with respect to acquisitions, dispositions, borrowings, issuances of common stock or other securities, and the declaration and payment of dividends on the common stock. In addition, Mr. Gabelli will be able to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders for approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change in control of our company. As a result of Mr. Gabelli\u2019s control, none of our agreements with Mr. Gabelli and other companies controlled by him can be assumed to have been arrived at through arm\u2019s-length negotiations, although we believe that the parties endeavor to implement market-based terms. There can be no assurance that we would not have received more favorable terms, or offered less favorable terms to, an unaffiliated party.\nWe depend on Mr. Gabelli and other key teammates.\nWe are dependent on the efforts of Mr. Gabelli, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Co-Chief Investment Officer (\u201cCIO\u201d) of the Value team (along with the two other Value Co-CIOs Christopher Marangi and Kevin Dreyer), and the primary portfolio manager for a significant majority of our AUM. The loss of Mr. Gabelli\u2019s services could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nOn February 6, 2008, Mr. Gabelli entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (as amended, the \u201c2008 Employment Agreement\u201d) with the Company, which was initially approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders on November 30, 2007 and approved again on May 6, 2011, May 5, 2015, and June 5, 2020, and which limits his activities outside of the Company. Under the 2008 Employment Agreement, the manner of computing Mr. Gabelli\u2019s remuneration from GAMCO is unchanged.\nMr. Gabelli has agreed that while he is employed by us he will not provide investment management services outside of GAMCO, Teton, AC, and GGCP, except for certain permitted accounts. These permitted accounts, excluding personal accounts, held assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 of approximately $295.8 million and $263.9 million, respectively. The 2008 Employment Agreement may not be amended without approval by the committee of our Board of Directors responsible for administering compensation and Mr. Gabelli.\nOur future success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to retain and attract other qualified teammates to conduct our investment management business, including Messrs. Marangi and Dreyer, the other Co-CIOs of the Value team, CIO - Growth Portfolios, Howard Ward, and Growth portfolio manager, Chris Ward, Caesar Bryan, who manages Gold portfolios, the Dinsmore team that manages the Convertible strategies, and Judy Raneri and Ron Eaker who manage the Gabelli U.S. Treasury Fund. The market for qualified portfolio managers is extremely competitive. We anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add portfolio managers and investment analysts as we further diversify our investment products and strategies. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain teammates. In addition, our investment professionals and senior marketing teammates have direct contact with our Institutional and PWM clients, which can lead to strong client relationships. The loss of these teammates could jeopardize our relationships with certain Institutional and PWM clients, and result in the loss of such accounts. The loss of key management professionals or the inability to recruit and retain sufficient portfolio managers and marketing teammates could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere may be adverse effects on our business from a decline in the performance of the securities markets.\nOur results of operations are affected by many economic factors, including the performance of the securities markets. The securities markets in general have experienced significant volatility, and such volatility may continue or increase in the future. At December 31, 2021, approximately 95% of our AUM was invested in portfolios consisting primarily of equity securities. Any decline in the securities markets, in general, and the equity markets, in particular, could reduce our AUM and consequently reduce our revenues. In addition, any such decline in the equity markets, failure of these markets to sustain their prior levels of growth, or continued short-term volatility in these markets could result in investors withdrawing from the equity markets or decreasing their rate of investment, either of which would be likely to adversely affect us. Also, from time to time, a relatively high proportion of the assets we manage may be concentrated in particular economic or industry sectors. A general decline in the performance of securities in those industry sectors could have an adverse effect on our AUM and revenues.\nSince the separation, certain of our directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions or relationships with AC.\nSince the separation of AC from GAMCO, Mr. Gabelli has continued to serve as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and also serves as Executive Chairman of AC. Marc Gabelli, a son of Mr. Gabelli, continues to have responsibilities relating to GAMCO and AC. Peter Goldstein, GAMCO\u2019s General Counsel and Secretary, serves as the Chief Legal Officer and Secretary of AC. Douglas R. Jamieson has continued to serve as President and Director of GAMCO Asset, a Director of GAMCO, and also serves as Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director of AC. In addition, certain of our portfolio managers and teammates provide services to AC pursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement with AC and are officers or employees of AC. Such dual assignments could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our and AC\u2019s officers and directors face decisions that could have different implications for the two companies.\nAlso, some of our directors, executive officers, portfolio managers, and teammates own shares of GGCP as well as AC common stock.\nMr. Gabelli is deemed to control AC by his control of GGCP Holdings, LLC, an intermediate subsidiary of GGCP, a private company controlled by Mr. Gabelli. Marc Gabelli is President of GGCP.\nIn addition, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between GAMCO and AC regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies. The executive officers and other personnel of AC who serve as directors or executive management of GAMCO may interpret these agreements in their capacity as AC employees in a manner that would adversely affect the business of GAMCO.\nAlso, certain subsidiaries of AC are investment advisers. The executive officers and other personnel of AC who also serve as directors or executive management of GAMCO may be confronted with the possibility of making decisions in their AC capacity that would adversely affect the business of GAMCO.\nBoth GAMCO and AC will work to identify and resolve any potential conflicts of interest, including, but not limited to, the types described above at the earliest possible time. However, there can be no guarantee that the interests of GAMCO may not be adversely affected at some point by such a conflict.\nOur reputation is critical to our success.\nOur reputation is critical to acquiring, maintaining, and developing relationships with our clients, Fund shareholders, and third party intermediaries. Misconduct by our teammates, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could result not only in direct financial harm but also in harm to our reputation, causing injury to the value of our brands and our ability to retain or attract AUM. Moreover, reputational harm may cause us to lose current teammates and we may be unable to attract new teammates with similar qualification or skills. Damage to our reputation could substantially reduce our AUM and impair our ability to maintain or grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThere is a possibility of losses associated with proprietary investment activities.\nCurrently, we maintain proprietary investment positions in securities. Market fluctuations and other factors may result in substantial losses in our proprietary accounts, which could have an adverse effect on our balance sheet, reduce our ability or willingness to make new investments, or impair our credit ratings.\nFuture investment performance could reduce revenues and other income.\nSuccess in the investment management and mutual fund businesses is dependent on investment performance as well as distribution and client servicing. Good performance generally stimulates sales of our investment products and tends to keep withdrawals and redemptions low, which generates higher advisory fees (which are based on the amount of AUM). Conversely, poor performance, both in absolute terms and/or relative to peers and industry benchmarks, tends to result in decreased sales, increased withdrawals and redemptions in the case of the open-end Funds, and in the loss of Institutional and PWM clients, with corresponding decreases in revenues to us. Many analysts of the mutual fund industry believe that investment performance is the most important factor for the growth of open-end and closed-end funds, such as those we offer. Failure of our investment products to perform well or failure of the Funds to maintain ratings or rankings could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, when our investment products experience strong results relative to the market or other asset classes, clients\u2019 investments in our products may increase beyond their target levels, and we could, therefore, suffer withdrawals as our clients rebalance their investments to fit their asset allocation preferences.\nLoss of significant Institutional and PWM accounts could affect our revenues.\nWe had approximately 1,400 Institutional and PWM accounts as of December 31, 2021, of which the ten largest accounts generated approximately 8% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021. Account turnover for any reason would have an adverse effect on our revenues. Notwithstanding performance, we have, from time to time, experienced account turnover of large Institutional and PWM accounts as a result of corporate mergers and restructurings, and we could continue to lose accounts under these and other circumstances, including the performance of our small cap and value mandates.\nA decline in the market for closed-end funds could reduce our ability to raise future assets to manage.\nMarket conditions may preclude us from increasing the assets we manage in our closed-end Funds. A significant portion of our growth in the assets we manage resulted from public offerings of the common and preferred shares of the closed-end Funds. We raised approximately $6.7 billion in gross assets through closed-end Fund offerings since January 2004. The market conditions for these offerings may not be as favorable in the future, which could adversely impact our ability to grow our AUM and our revenue.\nThe inability to access clients through third-party intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of the assets we manage is attributable to the distribution of our products through third-party intermediaries. Our ability to distribute our products is highly dependent on access to the client bases and product platforms of international, national and regional securities firms, investment advisory firms, banks, insurance companies, defined contribution plan administrators, and other intermediaries, which generally offer competing investment products that could limit the distribution of our products. In addition, our separate account business, subadvisory, and model delivery services depend in part on recommendations by consultants, financial planners, and other professional advisors, as well as our existing clients.\nThe structure and terms of the distribution arrangements with intermediaries, including fees or rebates paid by us or our funds to intermediaries to assist with distribution efforts, and the ability of our funds to participate in these intermediary platforms are subject to changes driven by market competition and regulatory developments. Our existing relationships with third-party intermediaries and access to new intermediaries could be adversely affected by continued consolidation within the financial services industry. Consolidation may result in increased distribution costs, a reduction in the number of third parties distributing our investment products, or increased competition to access third-party distribution channels. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain access to these channels. Loss of any of these third-party distribution channels, or changes to their structure and terms, or any reduction in our ability to access clients and investors through existing and new distribution channels, could adversely affect our business.\nOperational risks may disrupt our businesses, result in regulatory action against us, or limit our growth.\nWe face operational risk arising from errors made in the execution, confirmation, or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being properly recorded, evaluated, or accounted for. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, transactions across markets in an efficient and accurate manner. Consequently, we rely heavily on our financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. Despite the reliability of these systems, and the training and skill of our teammates and third parties we rely on, it remains likely that errors may occasionally occur due to the extremely large number of transactions we process. In addition, if systems we use are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions, our ability to expand our businesses could be constrained. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage.\nFailure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede the Company\u2019s productivity and growth. Additionally, failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures, and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in the Company\u2019s earnings or stock price.\nOur infrastructure, including our information systems and technology, is vital to the competitiveness of our business. The failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of our business could impede our productivity and growth, which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline. We outsource a significant portion of our information systems operations to third parties who are responsible for providing the management, maintenance, and updating of such systems. Technology is subject to rapid change and we cannot guarantee that our competitors may not implement more advanced technology platforms for their products than we do for ours. In addition, there can be no assurance that the cost of maintaining such outsourcing arrangements will not increase from its current level, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, any inaccuracies, delays, system failures, or security breaches in these and other systems could subject us to client dissatisfaction and losses. Breach of our technology systems could result in the loss of valuable information, liability for stolen assets or information, remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach, additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents, and litigation costs resulting from the incident. Moreover, loss of confidential customer identification information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. Further, although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other mobile electronic hardware, if such hardware is stolen, misplaced or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions by us.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. We may be the target of cyber-attacks, including denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in our, our clients\u2019, our counterparties\u2019, or third parties\u2019 operations, which could impact their ability to transact with us or otherwise result in significant losses or reputational damage. The increased use of mobile technologies can heighten these and other operational risks. We expect to expend additional resources on an ongoing basis to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\nWe routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential, and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties, and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties, and other third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse, or mishandling of personal, confidential, or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service provider, counterparty, or other third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action, and reputational harm.\nThe failure of one of our vendors to fulfill its obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its products.\nThe Company depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, and transfer agent roles and other operational needs. The failure or inability of the Company to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational issues for the Company and in certain products, which could result in financial losses for the Company and its clients.\nOur ability to meet cash needs may be adversely affected by a number of factors.\nOur ability to meet anticipated cash needs is affected by factors such as the market value of our assets, our operating cash flows, and our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders. Adverse developments in any of these areas could have significantly adverse effects on our business. If we are unable to obtain funds and financing in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans. Volatility in the U.S., regional, or global financing markets may also impact our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so, and we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or experience other adverse effects on our business.\nWe face exposure to legal actions, including litigation and arbitration claims and regulatory and governmental examinations and/or investigations. Insurance coverage for these matters may be inadequate.\nThe volume of litigation and arbitration claims against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed has increased over the past several years. The types of claims that we may face are varied. For example, we may face claims against us for purchasing securities that are inconsistent with a client\u2019s investment objectives or guidelines, in connection with the operation of the Funds, or arising from an employment dispute. The risk of litigation is difficult to predict, assess, or quantify, and may occur years after the activities or events at issue. In addition, from time to time we may become the subject of governmental or regulatory investigations and/or examinations. Even if we prevail in a legal or regulatory action, the costs alone of defending against the action or the harm to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on us. The insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to legal and regulatory actions may be inadequate or may not cover certain proceedings.\nCompliance failures could adversely affect us.\nOur investment management activities are subject to client guidelines, and our mutual fund business involves compliance with numerous investment, asset valuation, liquidity, distribution, and tax requirements. A failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their AUM, or terminating their contracts, any of which could cause the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings to decline. There can be no assurance that the precautions and procedures that we have instituted and installed or the insurance we maintain to protect ourselves in case of client losses will protect us from potential liabilities.\nWe face strong competition from numerous and, in many instances, larger companies.\nThe asset management business is intensely competitive. We compete with numerous investment management companies, stock brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, savings and loan associations, and other financial institutions. The periodic establishment of new investment management companies and other competitors increases the competition that we face. At the same time, consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own. Competition is based on various factors, including, among others, business reputation, investment performance, product mix and offerings, service quality and innovation, distribution relationships, and fees charged. Our competitive success in any or all of these areas cannot be assured. Additionally, competing securities dealers whom we rely upon to distribute our open-end Funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment products, which could limit the distribution of our investment products. To the extent that existing or potential customers, including securities dealers, decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues, and net income could decline.\nInvestors are choosing to invest in passive strategies such as index funds and ETFs.\nOur actively managed investment strategies compete against passive strategies. The trend in market demand for investors towards passive products such as index funds and ETFs, which favor our competitors in the asset management business, reduces opportunities for active managers. Investors are increasingly attracted to these lower fee passive products, which have gained, and may continue to gain, market share at the expense of active products like those managed by us.\nFee pressures could reduce our profit margins.\nThere has been a trend toward lower fees in some segments of the investment management industry. In order for us to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to provide clients with investment returns and service that will encourage them to be willing to pay such fees. Expense limitations and reimbursements have been put in place for certain classes of certain Funds. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.\nLaunch of new strategies and products may negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe may support the development of new investment strategies and products by waiving a portion of the management fees we are entitled to receive or by subsidizing expenses. Additionally, the costs with establishing new strategies and products, including actively managed semi-transparent ETFs, can exceed the revenues generated, which could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations. Also, we may provide seed capital to new strategies and products, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements or reduce our ability or willingness to make new investments.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe disparity in the voting rights among the classes of shares may have a potential adverse effect on the price of our Class A Stock.\nThe holders of Class A Stock and Class B Stock have identical rights except that (i) holders of Class A Stock are entitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class B Stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by shareholders in general, and (ii) holders of Class A Stock are not eligible to vote on matters relating exclusively to Class B Stock and vice versa. Since our IPO in 1999, Mr. Gabelli, through his control and majority ownership of GGCP, has beneficially owned a majority of our outstanding Class B Stock, currently representing approximately 96% of voting control. As long as Mr. Gabelli indirectly beneficially owns a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, he will have the ability to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and thereby control our management and affairs, including, among other things, any determinations with respect to acquisitions, dispositions, borrowings, issuances of common stock or other securities, and the declaration and payment of dividends on the common stock. The differential in voting rights and the ability of our company to issue additional Class B Stock could adversely affect the value of the Class A Stock to the extent the investors, or any potential future purchaser of our company, view the superior voting rights of the Class B Stock to have value. On May 3, 2017, Class A Stock shareholders approved an advisory proposal for the Board of Directors to consider the conversion and reclassification of our shares of Class B Stock into Class A Stock at a ratio in the range of 1.15 to 1.25 shares of Class A Stock for each share of Class B Stock. The Board of Directors has made no decision on this matter.\nFuture sales of our Class A Stock in the public market or sales or distributions of our Class B Stock could lower our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership in us.\nWe may sell additional shares of Class A Stock in subsequent public offerings. We also may issue additional shares of Class A Stock or convertible debt securities. On March 5, 2018, AC completed a tender offer in which tendering AC shareholders received an aggregate of approximately 660,000 shares of our registered Class A Stock constituting approximately 7% of the Class A Stock outstanding. On October 29, 2018, AC completed another tender offer in which tendering AC shareholders received an aggregate of approximately 710,000 shares of our registered Class A Stock constituting approximately 7% of the Class A Stock outstanding. During 2021 and 2020, AC sold 339,376 shares and 178,525 shares, respectively, of our Class A Stock constituting approximately 4% and 2%, respectively, of the Class A Stock outstanding. The market price of our Class A Stock could decline as a result of sales of Class A Stock by such shareholders. Any such sales, as well as sales by our other current shareholders, could be perceived negatively.\nNo prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales or distributions of Class B Stock owned by GGCP Holdings LLC will have on the market price of the Class A Stock from time to time. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of Class A Stock or Class B Stock, or the perception that such sales or distributions are likely to occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price for the Class A Stock.\nOur common stock has relatively limited trading volume, and ownership of a large percentage is concentrated with a small number of shareholders, which could increase the volatility in our stock trading and dramatically affect our share price.\nA large percentage of our common stock is held by a limited number of shareholders. If our larger shareholders decide to liquidate their positions, it could cause significant fluctuation in the share price of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe risk factors described above are those that we think may be material with regard to an investment in us that are not applicable generally to all business enterprises. However, we are subject to the many risks that affect all or most business enterprises in the U.S. or internationally, and our business or financial condition could be materially affected by those risks.", "PERMNO": 86593, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "GBL"}
