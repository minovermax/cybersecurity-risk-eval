RISK FACTORS\nThe Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within the Company's control, which may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. Investors should consider carefully information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in light of the risk factors described below.\nSales of our products are cyclical and/or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors. A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors can have a material adverse effect on us.\nHistorically, sales of products that we manufacture and sell have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors. In particular, demand for our products is cyclical and is impacted by the strength of the economy, generally, the availability of financing and other factors, including crude oil prices, that may have an effect on the level of construction activity on an international, national or regional basis. During periods of expansion in construction activity, we generally have benefited from increased demand for our products; challenging conditions can continue well beyond the end of such periods. Conversely, during recessionary periods, we have been adversely affected by reduced demand for our products. Furthermore, any future economic recession may impact leveraged companies, such as Manitowoc, more than competing companies with less leverage and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProducts also depend in part on federal, state, local and foreign governmental spending and appropriations, including infrastructure, security and defense outlays. Reductions in governmental spending can reduce demand for our products, which in turn, can negatively affect our performance. Our sales depend in part upon our customers\u2019 replacement or repair cycles. Adverse economic conditions may cause customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently adjust to market conditions, among other potential adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we could fail to deliver on planned results, fall short of analyst and investor expectations, incur high fixed costs and/or fail to benefit from higher than expected customer demand resulting in loss of market share.\nOur operational results are dependent on how well we can scale our manufacturing capacity and resources to the level of our customers\u2019 demand.\nWe operate in industries that require manufacturers to make highly efficient use of manufacturing capacity. Insufficient or excess capacity threatens our ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose us to liabilities related to contractual commitments. Although from time to time we close or consolidate facilities, such as the transition that is in process of certain manufacturing operations from our Manitowoc, Wisconsin facility to our Shady Grove, Pennsylvania facility and our consolidation of certain operations in Portugal, adapting or modifying our capacity is difficult, as modifications take substantial time to execute, are inherently disruptive and costly and, in some cases, may require regulatory approval. Additionally, delivering product during process or facility modifications requires special coordination. The cost and resources required to adapt our capacity, such as through facility acquisitions, facility closings or process moves between facilities, may negate any planned cost reductions or may result in costly delays, product quality issues or material shortages, all of which could adversely affect our operational results and our reputation with our customers.\nPrice increases in some materials and sources of supply could affect our profitability.\nWe use large amounts of steel, among other items, in the manufacture of our products. Occasionally, market prices of some of our key raw materials increase significantly. If in the future we are not able to reduce product costs in other areas or pass raw material price increases on to our customers, our margins could be adversely affected. In addition, because we maintain limited raw material and component inventories, even brief unanticipated delays in delivery by suppliers - including those due to capacity constraints, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of suppliers, weather emergencies or other natural disasters - may impair our ability to satisfy our customers and could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe Company purchases certain branded cranes under strategic alliances from various third-party suppliers which are then sold into our markets. If we are not able to effectively manage pricing from our suppliers, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our suppliers terminate these agreements and we are unable to procure alternate products at substantially similar competitive pricing, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon our ability to attract and retain key executives, managers and skilled personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have an adverse effect, at least in the short to medium term, on\nsignificant aspects of our business, including strategic planning and product development. Generally, our key employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to retain our key officers and employees. If certain subject-matter experts or employees with specialized skills move to employment elsewhere, we will incur significant costs in hiring, training, developing and retaining their replacements.\nBecause we participate in industries that are highly competitive, our net sales and profits could decline as we respond, or fail to effectively respond, to competition.\nWe sell most of our products in highly competitive industries. We compete in each of those industries based on product design, quality of products, quality and responsiveness of product support services, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and distribution resources than we do. We cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we do not develop new and innovative products or if customers in our markets do not accept them, our results would be negatively affected.\nOur products must be kept current to meet our customers\u2019 needs. To remain competitive, we therefore must develop new and innovative products on an on-going basis, and we invest significantly in the research and development of new products. If we do not successfully develop innovative products, it may be difficult to differentiate our products from our competitors\u2019 products and satisfy regulatory requirements, and our sales and results would suffer.\nIf we do not meet customers\u2019 product quality and reliability standards and expectations, we may experience increased or unexpected product warranty claims and other adverse consequences to our business.\nProduct quality and reliability are significant factors influencing customers' decisions to purchase our products. Inability to maintain the high quality of our products relative to the perceived or actual quality of similar products offered by competitors could result in the loss of market share, loss of revenue, reduced profitability, an increase in warranty costs and/or damage to our reputation.\nProduct quality and reliability are determined in part by factors that are not entirely within our control. We depend on our suppliers for parts and components that meet our standards. If our suppliers fail to meet those standards, we may not be able to deliver the quality of products that our customers expect, which may impair revenue and our reputation and lead to higher warranty costs.\nWe provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products we manufacture. Our warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from 12 months to 60 months. If a product fails to comply with the warranty, we may be obligated, at our expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing the defective product. Although we maintain warranty reserves in an amount based primarily on the number of units shipped and on historical and anticipated warranty claims, there can be no assurance that future warranty claims will follow historical patterns or that we can accurately anticipate the level of future warranty claims. An increase in the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our customers may not be able to obtain financing with third parties to purchase our products, and we may incur expenses associated with our assistance to customers in securing third-party financing.\nA portion of our sales are financed by third-party finance companies on behalf of our customers. The availability of financing from third parties is affected by general economic conditions, the creditworthiness of our customers and the estimated residual value of our equipment. In certain transactions, we provide residual value guarantees and buyback commitments to our customers or to third-party financial institutions. Deterioration in the credit quality of our customers or the overall health of the banking industry could negatively impact our customer\u2019s ability to obtain the resources needed to make purchases of our equipment or their ability to obtain third-party financing. In addition, if the actual value of the equipment for which we have provided a residual value guaranty declines below the amount of our guaranty, we may incur additional costs, which may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant manufacturing and sales of our products outside of the United States, which may present additional risks to our business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, approximately 60%, 58% and 59%, respectively, of our net sales were attributable to products sold outside of the United States. Expanding the Company\u2019s international sales is part of our growth\nstrategy. International operations generally are subject to various risks, including political, military, religious and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs, the effects of currency fluctuations, the impact of foreign government regulations, the effects of income and withholding tax, governmental expropriation and differences in business practices. We may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with our international sales, manufacturing and the integration of new facilities that could cause loss of revenue or increased cost. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climate and currency devaluations of various foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims which may be alleged in connection with the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products. Certain of our businesses also have experienced claims relating to past alleged asbestos exposure. Neither we nor our affiliates have to date incurred material costs related to these asbestos claims. We vigorously defend ourselves against current claims and intend to do so against future claims. We also maintain certain insurance policies which may limit our financial exposures. We do not believe the outcome of such matters will have an adverse effect on our financial position; however, any significant liabilities which are not covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Likewise, a substantial increase in the number of claims that are made against us or the amounts of any judgments or settlements could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or maintain our rights to use licensed intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur patents, trademarks and licenses are important in the operation of our businesses. Although we intend to protect our intellectual property rights vigorously, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in doing so. Third parties may assert or prosecute infringement claims against us in connection with the services and products that we offer, and we may or may not be able to successfully defend these claims. Litigation, either to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others, could result in substantial costs and in a diversion of our resources. In addition, if a third party would prevail in an infringement claim against us, then we would likely need to obtain a license from the third party on commercial terms, which would likely increase our costs. Our failure to maintain or obtain necessary licenses or an adverse outcome in any litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets represent a material amount of our total assets; as a result future impairment may have material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2016, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $413.7 million, or about 27% of our total assets. We assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. If future operating performance were to fall below current projections or if there are material changes to management\u2019s assumptions, we could be required to recognize a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any future goodwill or intangible asset impairments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur operations and profitability could suffer if we experience problems with labor relations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 4,900 people and had labor agreements with five local unions in North America. A large majority of our European employees belong to European trade unions. We have two trade unions in China and one trade union in India. During 2016, four of our union contracts expired and were successfully renegotiated without incident. We have ten union contracts involving an aggregate of 1,300 employees that expire in 2017.\nAny significant labor relations issues could have an adverse effect our operations, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur leverage may impair our operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total consolidated debt was $281.5 million as compared to consolidated debt of $1,397.6 million as of December 31, 2015, including the value of related interest rate hedging instruments. Upon completion of the Spin-Off, the Company entered into a $225.0 million Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility (as amended, the \u201cABL Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) by and among the Company and certain of its domestic and German subsidiaries, as borrowers, the lender party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, and Wells Fargo Bank N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA as joint lead arrangers. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility includes a $75.0 million Letter of Credit Facility, $10.0 million of which is available to the German borrower, with a term of 5 years.\nAlthough actions taken in connection with the Spin-Off reduced our debt load, the amount of debt we maintain could have consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest rather than to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate.\nThe agreements governing our debt include covenants that restrict, among other matters, our ability to incur additional debt; pay dividends on or repurchase our equity; make certain investments; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. Certain of our debt facilities require or will require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants may also require that we take disadvantageous actions, including reducing spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation, reducing future financing for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. Our leverage could also put us at a disadvantage compared to any competitors that are less leveraged. We cannot be certain that we will meet any future financial tests or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet those tests. See additional discussion in Note 11, \u201cDebt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we default under our debt agreements, our lenders could elect, among other potential remedies, to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and could proceed against any collateral securing the debt. Under those circumstances, in the absence of readily-available refinancing on favorable terms, we might elect or be compelled to enter bankruptcy proceedings, in which case our shareholders could lose the entire value of their investment in our common stock.\nWe are exposed to the risks of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations.\nCertain of our indebtedness accrues interest at a variable rate, therefore, increases in interest rates will reduce our operating cash flows and could hinder our ability to fund our operations or capital expenditures. In such cases, we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but hedging our exposure carries the risk that we may forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates were to change in our favor. Developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates is complex, and no strategy is guaranteed to completely insulate us from the risks associated with such fluctuations.\nAdditionally, some of our operations are or will be conducted by subsidiaries in foreign countries. The results of the operations and the financial position of these subsidiaries will be reported in the relevant foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements, which are stated in U.S. dollars. The exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Such fluctuations may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nWe also incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a transaction using a different currency than its functional currency. We attempt to reduce currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a material transaction using a different currency than its functional currency by:\n\u2022\nmatching cash flows and payments in the same currency;\n\u2022\ndirect foreign currency borrowing; and\n\u2022\nentering into foreign exchange contracts for hedging purposes.\nHowever, we may not be able to hedge this risk completely or at an acceptable cost, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.\nChanges to tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.\nTax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the United States. A significant change to the tax system in the United States, including changes to the taxation of international income and/or duties on imports or exports, could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations. We regularly undergo tax audits in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties and/or interest assessments.\nOur business and/or reputation could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nCertain of our shareholders have publicly or privately expressed views with respect to the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations or other matters that may not be fully aligned with our own. Responding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our reputation and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified directors, personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.\nActivist shareholders have made, and may in the future make, strategic proposals, suggestions or requests for changes concerning the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations or other matters. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any consequences arising from these actions, and any such consequences may impact the value of our securities.\nEnvironmental liabilities that may arise in the future could be material to us.\nOur operations, facilities and properties are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination, and otherwise relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment. As a result, we are involved from time to time in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental and health and safety matters and have in the past and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures relating to such matters.\nWe cannot be certain that identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and give rise to additional environmental liabilities, compliance costs and/or penalties that could be material. Further, environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect they may have upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our internal and external data centers, cloud services and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our partners, may be vulnerable to malicious attacks or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including as a result of rollouts of new systems. Any such breach or operational failure would compromise our networks and/or that of our partners and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and/or regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and/or cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur inability to recover from natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and financial results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control, such as natural or manmade disasters, national emergencies, significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, war or terrorist activities that could curtail production at our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and canceled orders. In addition, we purchase components and raw materials and information technology and other services from numerous suppliers, and, even if our facilities were not directly affected by such events, we could be affected by interruptions at such suppliers. Such suppliers may be less likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations. We cannot assure you that we will have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe must comply with all applicable international trade, customs, export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. The new presidential administration in the United States has taken, and make take additional, actions that may inhibit international trade by U.S.-based companies.\nChanges in trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violation of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions or fines and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 51263, "SIC": 3530, "TIC": "MTW"}
