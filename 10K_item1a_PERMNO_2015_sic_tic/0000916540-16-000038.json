In consultation with your financial, tax and legal advisors, you should carefully consider, among other matters, the following risks in, as well as the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into, this report. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in the common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial condition or the market price of our common stock. The risks described below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in this filing.\nRisks Related to the Company\nThe prices of many of our products are subject to significant volatility associated with commodities markets.\nOur principal finished products include MBM, BFT, YG and hides, which are commodities. We also manufacture and sell a number of other products that are derived from animal by-products and many of which are commodities or compete with commodities. The prices of these commodities are quoted on, or derived from prices quoted on, established commodity markets. Accordingly, our results of operations will be affected by fluctuations in the prevailing market prices of these finished products or of other commodities that may be substituted for our products by our customers. Historically, market prices for commodity grains, fats and food stocks have fluctuated in response to a number of factors, including global changes in supply and demand resulting from changes in local and global economic conditions, changes in global government agriculture programs, changes in energy policies of U.S. and foreign governments, changes in international agricultural trading policies, impact of disease outbreaks on protein sources and the potential effect on supply and demand, as well as weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons. While we seek to mitigate the risks associated with price declines, including by diversifying our finished products offerings, through the use of formula pricing tied to commodity prices for a substantial portion of our raw materials (which may not protect our margins in periods of rapidly declining prices) and hedging, a significant decrease in the market price of any of our products or of other commodities that may be substituted for our products would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. Furthermore, rapid and material changes in finished goods prices, including competing agricultural-based alternative ingredients, generally have an immediate and, often times, material impact on the Company\u2019s gross margin and profitability resulting from the lag effect or lapse of time from the procurement of the raw materials until they are processed and the finished goods are sold.\nThe prices available for the Company\u2019s Food Ingredients segment\u2019s gelatin, edible fats and natural casings products are influenced by other competing ingredients, including plant-based and synthetic hydrocolloids and artificial casings. In the gelatin operation, in particular, the cost of the Company's animal-based raw material moves in relationship to the selling price of the finished goods. The processing time for gelatin and casings is generally 30 to 60 days, which is substantially longer than the Company's animal by-products operations. Consequently, the Company\u2019s gross margin and profitability in this segment can be\ninfluenced by the movement of finished goods prices from the time the raw materials were procured until the finished goods are sold.\nIn addition, increases in the market prices of raw materials would require us to raise prices for our premium, value-added and branded products to avoid margin deterioration. There can be no assurance as to whether we could implement future price increases in response to increases in the market prices of raw materials or how any such price increases would affect future sales volumes to our customers. Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in the future by this volatility.\nOur business is dependent on the procurement of raw materials, which is the most competitive aspect of our business.\nOur management believes that the most competitive aspect of our business is the procurement of raw materials rather than the sale of finished products. Many of our raw materials are derived directly or indirectly from animal by-products, which results in the following challenges:\n\u2022\nIn North America, consolidation within the meat processing industry has resulted in bigger and more efficient slaughtering operations, the majority of which utilize \u201ccaptive\u201d renderers (rendering operations integrated with the meat or poultry packing operation).\n\u2022\nConcurrently, the number of small U.S. meat processors, which have historically been a dependable source of supply for non-captive or independent U.S. renderers, such as us, has decreased significantly.\n\u2022\nThe slaughter rates in the U.S. and international meat processing industry are subject to decline during poor economic conditions when consumers generally reduce their consumption of protein, and as a result, during such periods of decline, the availability, quantity and quality of raw materials available to the independent renderers, such as us, decreases.\n\u2022\nIn addition, the Company has seen an increase in the use of used cooking oil in the production of biodiesel, which has increased competition for the collection of used cooking oil from restaurants and other food service establishments and contributed to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of theft of used cooking oil in the United States.\n\u2022\nFurthermore, a decline in the general performance of the global economy (including a decline in consumer confidence) and any inability of consumers and companies to obtain credit in the financial markets could have a negative impact on our raw material volume, such as through the forced closure of any of our raw material suppliers. A significant decrease in available raw materials or a closure of a significant number of raw material suppliers could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including the carrying value of certain of our assets.\nThe rendering industry is highly fragmented and both the rendering and bakery residual industries are very competitive. We compete with other rendering businesses and alternative methods of disposal of animal by-products, bakery residue and used cooking oil provided by trash haulers, waste management companies and biodiesel companies, as well as the alternative of illegal disposal. See Item 1. \u201cCompetition.\u201d In addition, U.S. restaurants experience theft of used cooking oil, the frequency and magnitude of which increases with the rise in value of used cooking oil. Depending on market conditions, we either charge a collection fee to offset a portion of the cost incurred in collecting raw material or will pay for the raw material. To the extent suppliers of raw materials look to alternate methods of disposal, whether as a result of our collection fees being deemed too expensive, the payments we offer being deemed too low or otherwise, our raw material supply will decrease and our collection fee revenues will decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the amount of raw material acquired, which has a direct impact on the amount of finished goods produced, can also have a material effect on our gross margin reported, as the Company has a substantial amount of fixed operating costs.\nA majority of the Company's U.S. volume of animal by-product raw materials, including all of its significant U.S. poultry accounts, and substantially all of the Company's U.S. bakery feed raw materials, are acquired on a \u201cformula basis,\u201d which in most cases is set forth in contracts with our suppliers, generally with multi-year terms. These \u201cformulas\u201d allow us to mitigate the risks associated with decreases in commodity prices by adjusting our costs of materials based on changes in the price of our finished products, while also permitting us, in certain cases, to benefit from increases in commodity prices. The formulas provided in these contracts are reviewed and modified both during the term of, and in connection with the renewal of, the contracts to maintain an acceptable level of sharing between us and our suppliers of the costs and benefits from movements in commodity prices. Changes to these formulas or the inability to renew such contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand financial condition. A majority of Rothsay\u2019s animal by-product raw materials are acquired based on prices fixed on a quarterly basis with suppliers, with the remaining portion acquired on a \u201cformula basis.\u201d A majority of Darling Ingredients International\u2019s volume of animal by-product raw materials are acquired at spot or quarterly fixed prices. Although Darling Ingredients International, in general, has no long term contracts with its key suppliers, it has procured a series of four-year supply agreements with VION Food that became effective concurrently with the completion of the VION Acquisition and provided approximately 12% of Darling Ingredients International\u2019s raw material supply in fiscal 2015.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, which could affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants.\nOur international operations have expanded significantly and our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates has increased accordingly. We now carry out transactions in a number of foreign currencies, principally the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Argentine peso, the Australian dollar and the Polish zloty. To the extent possible, we attempt to match revenues and expenses in each of the currencies in which we operate. However, we will still be exposed to currency fluctuations when we translate the results of our overseas operations into U.S. dollars, our functional currency, in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar may fluctuate and these fluctuations may affect our U.S. dollar-denominated results of operations and financial condition even if our underlying operations and financial condition, in local currency terms, remain unchanged. While we have entered into and may from time to time enter into the use of currency hedging instruments to provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, there can be no assurance that such instruments will successfully protect us from more pronounced swings in such exchange rates. Further, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nWe also face risks arising from the possible future imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries located in, or business conducted within, a country imposing such controls. Currency devaluations would result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\nAny fluctuations in exchange rates or the imposition of exchange controls or currency devaluation may adversely impact our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants under the documents governing our indebtedness, which could affect our ability to incur indebtedness, pay dividends, make investments or take other actions that might be in our best interest. Should our international operations continue to expand, they will represent a larger part of our business and such exchange rate fluctuations may have a greater impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on natural gas, diesel fuel and electricity, the price of which can be volatile, and such dependency could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are highly dependent on the use of natural gas, diesel fuel and electricity. We consume significant volumes of natural gas to operate boilers in our plants, which generate steam to heat raw materials. Natural gas prices represent a significant cost of facility operations included in cost of sales. We also consume significant volumes of diesel fuel to operate our fleet of tractors and trucks used to collect raw materials. Diesel fuel prices represent a significant component of cost of collection expenses included in cost of sales. Prices for both natural gas and diesel fuel can be volatile and therefore represent an ongoing challenge to our operating results. Although we continually manage these costs and hedge our exposure to changes in fuel prices through our formula pricing and from time to time derivatives, a material increase in prices for natural gas and/or diesel fuel over a sustained period of time could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also require a significant amount of electricity in operating certain of our facilities, a disruption of which or a significant increase in the cost of which could have a material adverse affect on the business and results of operations of the affected facility.\nA significant percentage of our revenue is attributable to a limited number of suppliers and customers.\nIn fiscal 2015, the Company's top ten customers for finished products accounted for approximately 19% of product sales. In addition, the Company's top ten raw material suppliers accounted for approximately 21% of its raw material supply in the same period. VION Food, Darling Ingredients International\u2019s largest raw materials supplier, accounted for approximately 12% of Darling Ingredients International\u2019s raw materials supply in fiscal 2015. Darling Ingredients International has entered into supply agreements with VION Food pursuant to which VION Food supplies Darling Ingredients International with by-products generated by VION Food\u2019s operations. The supply agreements all have a term of four years and became effective concurrently with the completion of the VION Acquisition. MFI, Rothsay\u2019s largest raw materials supplier, accounted for approximately 23% of Rothsay\u2019s raw materials supply in fiscal 2015. In connection with the Rothsay Acquisition, we entered into a seven-year supply agreement with MFI to supply us with substantially all of the MFI raw materials processed by Rothsay prior to the sale.\nDisruptions or modifications to, or termination of, our relationships with any of our significant suppliers or customers, or financial difficulties experienced by any of our suppliers or customers that lead to curtailment or termination of their operations, could cause our businesses to suffer significant financial losses and could have a material adverse impact on our business, earnings, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nCertain of our operating facilities are highly dependent upon a single or a few suppliers.\nCertain of our operating facilities are highly dependent on one or a few suppliers. Should any of these suppliers choose alternate methods of disposal, cease their operations, have their operations interrupted by casualty, curtail their operations or otherwise cease using our collection services, these operating facilities may be materially and adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with our international activities, which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries and our operations and assets in such countries.\nWe conduct foreign operations in Europe, Canada, Asia, South America and Australia. While we expect that our geographical diversity reduces our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also subjects us to the various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:\n\u2022\nimposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures imposed by foreign countries regarding the importation of poultry, beef and pork products, in addition to operating, import or export licensing requirements imposed by various foreign countries;\n\u2022\nimposition of border restrictions by foreign countries with respect to the import of poultry, beef and pork products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues;\n\u2022\nimpact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Argentine peso, the Australian dollar and the Polish zloty, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of the revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets or of our assets in non-U.S. countries or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars in those markets;\n\u2022\nexchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials, import or export finished products or to repatriate earnings from overseas, such as exchange controls in effect in China, that may limit our ability to repatriate earnings from those countries;\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory structures (including creditor rights that may be different than in the United States) and unexpected changes in regulatory environments (including, without limitation, in China), including changes resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or imposition of onerous trade restrictions, price controls, industry controls, animal and human food safety controls, employee welfare schemes or other government controls;\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability, social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions or other changes in political, economic or social conditions in the respective jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in our effective tax rate including, tax rates that may exceed those in the United States, earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation, changes in the mix of our business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate and adverse outcomes from tax audits;\n\u2022\ncompliance with and enforcement of a wide variety of complex U.S. and non-U.S. laws, treaties and regulations, including, without limitation, anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the Brazilian corporate anti-corruption law and similar anti-corruption legislation in many jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as economic and trade sanctions enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the EU and other governmental entities; and\n\u2022\ndistribution costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability or increased costs of freight transportation.\nThese risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of our international markets or in other developing markets and may have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe DGD Joint Venture subjects us to a number of risks.\nIn January 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a limited liability company agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valero to form the DGD Joint Venture, which was formed to design, engineer, construct and operate the DGD Facility, which is capable of processing approximately 12,000 barrels per day of input feedstock to produce renewable diesel fuel and certain other co-products. The DGD Facility, which is located adjacent to Valero\u2019s refinery in Norco, Louisiana, reached mechanical completion and began production of renewable diesel in late June 2013. As of January 2, 2016, under the equity method of accounting, we had an investment in the DGD Joint Venture of approximately $225.8 million included on the consolidated balance sheet. There is no assurance that the DGD Joint Venture will continue to be profitable or allow us to continue to make a return on our investment.\nThe DGD Joint Venture is dependent on governmental energy policies and programs, such as the RFS2 and low carbon fuel standards (LCFS) (such as in the state of California), which positively impact the demand for and price of renewable diesel. Any changes to, a failure to enforce or a discontinuation of any of these programs could have a material adverse affect on the DGD Joint Venture. See the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Our biofuels business may be affected by energy policies of U.S. and foreign governments.\u201d Similarly, the DGD Joint Venture is subject to the risk that new or changing technologies may be developed that could meet demand for renewable diesel under governmental mandates in a more efficient or less costly manner than the technologies used by the DGD Joint Venture, which could negatively affect the price of renewable diesel and have a material adverse affect on the DGD Joint Venture.\nIn addition, the operation of a joint venture such as this involves a number of risks that could harm our business and result in the DGD Joint Venture not performing as expected, such as:\n\u2022\nproblems integrating or developing operations, personnel, technologies or products;\n\u2022\nthe unanticipated breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including any unforeseen issues that may arise in connection with the operation of the DGD Facility;\n\u2022\nthe inaccuracy of our assumptions about prices for the renewal diesel that the DGD Joint Venture produces;\n\u2022\nunforeseen engineering or environmental issues, including new or more stringent environmental regulations affecting operations;\n\u2022\nthe inaccuracy of our assumptions about the timing and amount of anticipated revenues and operating costs including feedstock prices;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management time and resources;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining and maintaining permits and other regulatory issues, potential license revocation and changes in legal requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing and maintaining relationships with suppliers and end user customers;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the DGD Joint Venture\u2019s loan agreement with Valero prohibit the payment of distributions to the DGD Joint Venture partners until certain conditions required by the loan agreement with Valero are satisfied; however, those conditions were met in fiscal 2015 and the DGD Joint Venture distributed $50.0 million to the DGD Joint Venture partners;\n\u2022\nthe risk that one or more competitive new renewable diesel plants are constructed that use different technologies from the DGD Joint Venture facility and result in the marketing of products that are more effective as a substitute for carbon-based fuels or less expensive than the products marketed by the DGD Joint Venture;\n\u2022\nperformance below expected levels of output or efficiency;\n\u2022\nreliance on Valero and its adjacent refinery facility for many services and processes;\n\u2022\nif any of the risks described in connection with the DGD Joint Venture occur, possible impairment of the acquired assets, including intangible assets;\n\u2022\npossible third party claims of intellectual property infringement; and\n\u2022\nbeing forced to sell our equity interests in the DGD Joint Venture pursuant to buy/sell provisions in the DGD Joint Venture\u2019s operating agreement and not realizing the benefits of the DGD Joint Venture.\nIf any of these risks described above were to materialize and the operations of the DGD Joint Venture were significantly disrupted, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations could result.\nOur biofuels business may be affected by energy policies of U.S. and foreign governments.\nPursuant to the requirements established by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA finalized regulations for RFS2 in 2010. The regulation mandated the domestic use of biomass-based diesel (biodiesel or renewable diesel) of 1.0 billion gallons in 2012. Beyond 2012, the regulation requires a minimum of 1.0 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel for each year through 2022, which amount is subject to increase by the Administrator of the EPA. On November 30, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule establishing the biomass-based diesel obligations for 2014 (1.63 billion gallons), 2015 (1.73 billion gallons), 2016 (1.9 billion gallons) and 2017 (2.0 billion gallons). In addition the EPA established the advanced biofuel requirements for 2014 (2.67 billion RINs), 2015 (2.88 billion RINs) and 2016 (3.61 billion RINs), as well as the total renewable fuel obligation for 2014 (16.28 billion RINs), 2015 (16.93 billion RINs) and 2016 (18.11 billion RINs). Biomass-based diesel qualifies to fulfill the biomass based diesel requirement, the non-specified portion of the advanced biofuel requirement and the total renewable fuel requirement. In order to qualify as a \u201crenewable fuel\u201d each type of fuel from each type of feedstock is required to lower greenhouse gas emissions (\u201cGHG\u201d) by levels specified in the regulation. The EPA has determined that biofuels (either biodiesel or renewable diesel) produced from waste oils, fats and greases result in an 86% reduction in GHG emissions, exceeding the 50% requirement established by the regulation. Prices for our finished products may be impacted by worldwide government policies relating to renewable fuels and GHG. Programs like RFS2 and LCFS and tax credits for biofuels both in the United States and abroad may positively impact the demand for our finished products. In fiscal 2015, the amount of tax credits for biofuels impacting the Company was material. Conversely, legal challenges to, changes to, a failure to enforce, reductions in the mandated volumes under, or discontinuing any of these programs could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, the blenders tax credits expire on December 31, 2016, and is therefore at risk for calendar year 2017 and into the future due to delay or denial of extension.\nWe may incur material costs and liabilities in complying with government regulations.\nWe are subject to the rules and regulations of various governmental agencies in the United States, the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d), Canada, China and the other countries in which Darling Ingredients International operates. These include rules and regulations administered by governmental agencies at the supranational, federal, state, provincial or local level. See Item1. \"Business - Regulations\" for a listing of certain governmental agencies to which we are subject.\nThe applicable rules, regulations and guidance promulgated by these and other agencies, which are likely to change over time, affect our operations and may influence our operating results at one or more facilities. Furthermore, the loss of or failure to obtain necessary federal, state, provincial or local permits and registrations at one or more of our facilities could halt or curtail operations at impacted facilities, which could result in impairment charges related to the affected facility and otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable rules, regulations and guidance, including obtaining or maintaining required operating certificates or permits, could subject us to: (i) administrative penalties and injunctive relief; (ii) civil remedies, including fines, injunctions and product recalls; and (iii) adverse publicity. There can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs and liabilities in connection with these rules, regulations and guidance.\nBecause of our international operations throughout much of the world, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair business advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. In addition, we may enter into joint ventures with joint venture partners who are domiciled in areas of the world with anti-bribery laws, regulations and business practices that differ from those in the United States. There is risk that our joint venture partners will violate the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations. While our policies mandate compliance with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from violations committed by our employees, joint venture partners or\nagents. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in lengthy investigations and possibly disrupt our business, lead to criminal and/or civil legal proceedings brought by governmental agencies and/or third parties, result in material fines and legal and other costs and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nGiven the competitive nature of our industry, we could be adversely affected by violations of various countries\u2019 antitrust, competition and consumer protection laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and individuals from engaging in anticompetitive and unfair business practices. While our policies mandate compliance with these laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint venture partners or agents.\nSeasonal factors and weather, including the physical impacts of climate change, can impact the availability, quality and volume of raw materials that we process and negatively affect our operations.\nThe quantity of raw materials available to us is impacted by seasonal factors, including holidays, when raw material volumes decline, and cold weather, which can impact the collection of raw materials. In addition, warm weather can adversely affect the quality of raw materials processed and our yield on production due to more rapidly degrading raw materials. In addition to seasonal impacts, depending upon the location of our facilities and those of our suppliers, our operations could be subject to the physical impacts of climate change, including changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels. Physical damage, flooding, excessive snowfall or drought resulting from changing climate patterns could adversely impact our costs and business operations, the availability and costs of our raw materials, and the supply and demand for our end products. These effects could be material to our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. The quality and volume of the finished products that we are able to produce could be negatively impacted by unseasonable or severe weather or unexpected declines in the volume of raw materials available during holidays, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, severe weather events may also impact our ability to collect or process raw materials or to transport finished products.\nDownturns and volatility in global economies and commodity and credit markets could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by the conditions of the global economies and the credit, commodities and stock markets. Among other things, we may be adversely impacted if our domestic and international customers and suppliers are not able to access sufficient capital to continue to operate their businesses or to operate them at prior levels. A decline in consumer confidence or changing patterns in the availability and use of disposable income by consumers can negatively affect both our suppliers and customers. Declining discretionary consumer spending or the loss or impairment of a meaningful number of our suppliers or customers could lead to a dislocation in either raw material availability or customer demand. Any tightening in credit supply could negatively affect our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products on a timely basis or at all and could result in a requirement for additional bad debt reserves. Although many of our customer contracts are formula-based, continued volatility in the commodities markets could negatively impact our revenues and overall profits. Counterparty risk on finished product sales can also impact revenue and operating profits when customers either are unable to obtain credit or refuse to take delivery of finished products due to market price declines.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of January 2, 2016, our total indebtedness, including trade debt was approximately $2.0 billion. Our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our financial lenders and our contractual and commercial commitments;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows from operations available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry and business conditions;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nincreasing our exposure to the impact on our debt level of changes in foreign exchange rate conversion to functional currency;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the indenture that governs our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our funded indebtedness. See Item 7. \u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d - \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d, \u201c5.375% Senior Notes due 2022\u201d and \u201c4.75% Senior Notes due 2022.\u201d\nDespite our existing level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including additional secured indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities. Although the indenture that governs the senior notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent that we or our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our indebtedness, including our possible inability to service our indebtedness, could intensify. See Item 7. \u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d - \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d, \u201c5.375% Senior Notes due 2022\u201d and \u201c4.75% Senior Notes due 2022.\u201d\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and to meet our other cash needs, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and our other cash needs. The credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes restrict our ability to use the proceeds from the disposition of assets, debt incurrence or sales of equity to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate any such dispositions or to obtain debt or equity proceeds in amounts sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due, and we may be restricted under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities or the indenture governing our senior notes from using any such amounts to service other debt obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments under any of the agreements governing our debt, we would be in default under such agreements, which could allow lenders under any credit facilities to terminate their commitments to loan money and could allow the applicable lenders or other debt holders to declare all outstanding principal and interest of such debt to be immediately due and payable, and, in the case of secured debt, to foreclose against the assets securing such debt and apply the proceeds from such foreclosure to repay amounts owed to them. Any of these events would likely in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in our other debt instruments, which would allow the creditors under those instruments to exercise similar rights. If any of these actions are taken, we could be forced into restructuring, bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur ability to repay our indebtedness depends in part on the performance of our subsidiaries, including our non-guarantor subsidiaries, and their ability to make payments.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, a number of which operate outside the United States. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us. Unless they are guarantors of the indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. For example, our subsidiaries that are organized under the laws of, and operate in, China, currently have substantial regulatory restrictions on their ability to make cash available to us. While the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements governing certain of our other indebtedness will limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions.\nOur business may be affected by the impact of BSE and other food safety issues.\nEffective August 1997, the FDA promulgated the BSE Feed Rule to prevent further spread of BSE. Detection of the first case of BSE in the United States in December 2003 resulted in additional U.S. government regulations, finished product export restrictions by foreign governments, market price fluctuations for our finished products and reduced demand for beef and beef products by consumers. Even though the export markets for U.S. beef have recovered to meet or exceed pre-BSE levels, many export markets remain closed to MBM derived from U.S. beef. On May 29, 2013, the USDA announced that the OIE had officially upgraded the BSE-status for the United States from \u201ccontrolled risk\u201d to \u201cnegligible risk\u201d based on a thorough review of BSE safeguards implemented in the United States. Attaining a negligible risk status for BSE is an important step toward regaining access to export markets for U.S. MBM and some markets reopened following this change. We do not expect this trade disruption to have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, continued concern about BSE in the United States, and other countries in which we operate now or in the future, may result in additional regulatory and market related challenges that may affect our operations or increase our operating costs.\nWith respect to BSE in the United States, on October 26, 2009, the FDA began enforcing the Enhanced BSE Rule. These new regulations amended the BSE Feed Rule to also prohibit the use of tallow having more than 0.15% insoluble impurities in feed for cattle or other ruminant animals. In addition, the Enhanced BSE Rule prohibits brain and spinal cord material from cattle aged 30 months and older or the carcasses of such cattle, if the brain and spinal cord are not removed (collectively, \u201cProhibited Cattle Materials\u201d), and tallow derived from Prohibited Cattle Materials that also contains more than 0.15% insoluble impurities in the feed or food for all animals. We have made capital expenditures and implemented processes and procedures to be compliant with the Enhanced BSE Rule at all of our U.S. operations. In Canada, the CFIA implemented feed restrictions, which were similar to the FDA\u2019s BSE Feed Rule, in 1997 to prevent the spread of BSE. Following confirmation of nine positive cases of BSE between May 2003 and July 2007, however, the CFIA amended the Canadian Health of Animals Regulations to strengthen Canada\u2019s BSE safeguards (\u201cSRM Ban\u201d). These enhanced safeguards, which became effective July 2007, required the removal of all SRMs from animal feed, pet food and fertilizer; placed the removal, transport and disposal of SRM under direct CFIA control; prohibited the use of tallow containing more than 0.15% insoluble impurities in any animal feed; and extended the retention time for keeping relevant records from two years to 10 years. Other cases of BSE have been reported in Canada since the SRM Ban was implemented. The most recent case occurred on February 12, 2015 and the CFIA reported that no part of the infected carcass entered human or animal food systems. We can provide no assurance that unanticipated costs and/or reductions in raw material volumes related to our compliance with the Enhanced BSE Rule, the SRM Ban or the occurrence of new cases of BSE will not negatively impact our operations and financial performance.\nWith respect to human food, pet food and animal feed safety in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the \u201cFDAAA\u201d) directed the FDA to establish a Reportable Food Registry (\u201cRFR\u201d), which was implemented on September 8, 2009. On June 11, 2009, the FDA issued \u201cGuidance for Industry: Questions and Answers Regarding the Reportable Food Registry as Established by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007: Draft Guidance\u201d (\u201cRFR Draft Guidance\u201d). Although the RFR Draft Guidance was revised in September 2009 and again in May 2010, it had not been finalized as of the date of this report. In the RFR Draft Guidance, the FDA defined a reportable food, which the manufacturer or distributor would be required to report in the RFR, to include materials used as ingredients in animal feeds and pet foods, if there is reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such materials will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. In March 2014, the FDA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit comments and information regarding provisions in the Food Safety Modernization Act (\u201cFSMA\u201d) that amended Section 417 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFD&C Act\u201d), which governs the RFR, to permit the FDA to require the submission of \"consumer-oriented information\" regarding a reportable food. The FDA later reopened the comment period for the advance notice of proposed rulemaking and set August 18, 2014 as the deadline for comments. In July 2013, the FDA announced the criteria to be used to\ndetermine whether the agency will prioritize regulatory action against pet food and farmed animal feeds that may be injurious to health because they are contaminated with Salmonella (and therefore considered to be adulterated under section 402(a)(1) of FD&C Act) in the \u201cCompliance Policy Guide Sec. 690.800, Salmonella in Food for Animals\u201d (the \u201cCPG\u201d). According to the CPG, any finished pet food contaminated with any species of Salmonella will be considered adulterated and the FDA believes regulatory action is warranted in cases involving such pet foods because of the heightened risk to humans given the high likelihood of direct human contact with the pet food. Finished animal feeds intended for pigs, poultry and other farmed animals, however, will be considered to be adulterated only if the feed is contaminated with a species of Salmonella that is considered to be pathogenic for the animal species for which the feed is intended. The finalization of the RFR Draft Guidance and the possible issuance of a rule pursuant to the FSMA by the FDA may impose additional requirements on us. We believe that we have adequate procedures in place to assure that our finished products are safe to use in animal feed and pet food and we do not currently anticipate that the FDAAA will have a significant impact on our operations or financial performance. Any pathogen, such as Salmonella, that is correctly or incorrectly associated with our finished products could have a negative impact on the demand for our finished products.\nIn addition, the FSMA was enacted on January 4, 2011. The FSMA gave the FDA new authorities, which became effective immediately. Included among these is a mandatory recall authority for adulterated foods that are likely to cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals, if the responsible party fails to cease distribution and recall such adulterated foods voluntarily. The FSMA further instructed the FDA to amend existing regulations that define its administrative detention authority. Prior to the FSMA becoming law, the FDA had authority to order that an article of food be detained only if there was credible evidence or information indicating that the article of food presented a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. On May 5, 2011, the FDA issued an interim final rule amending its administrative detention authority and lowering both the level of proof and the degree of risk required for detaining an article of food. This interim final rule, which became a final rule on February 5, 2013, gives the FDA authority to detain an article of food if there is reason to believe the food is adulterated or misbranded. The FSMA also requires the FDA to develop new regulations that, among other provisions, place additional registration requirements on food and feed producing firms. Section 102 of the FSMA amends facility registration requirements in the FD&C Act for domestic and foreign manufacturers, processors, packers or holders of food for human or animal consumption. Such facility registrations were previously required to be updated when changes in a facility occurred, but there were no provisions for renewing facility registrations. The FSMA, however, requires that facility registrations be renewed during the fourth quarter of each even-numbered year, beginning October 1, 2012. On April 9, 2015, the FDA published a proposed rule that would, among other things, require electronic submission of facility registrations (no sooner than January 4, 2016), require registrations to indicate the type of activity conducted at the facility for each food product category and provide for verification of certain information submitted in registrations. Other new FDA regulations mandated by the FSMA, some of which are still in the proposed stage, will require registered facilities to perform hazard analyses and to implement preventive measures to control those hazards identified to be reasonably likely to occur; increase the length of time that records are required to be retained; and regulate the sanitary transportation of food, which is defined in Section 201(f) of the FD&C Act to include \u201carticles used for food or drink for man or other animals.\u201d The FDA proposed new rules on January 16, 2013 and October 29, 2013 addressing preventive controls (\u201cPCs\u201d) for food for humans and for animals, respectively, and issued amended proposed rules for human food and animal feed on September 29, 2014. The FDA finalized these rules for human food and animal feed on September 17, 2015 (\u201cHuman Food PC Rule\u201d and \u201cAnimal Food PC Rule,\u201d respectively), creating regulations applicable to facilities that manufacture, process, pack and hold human or animal food and requiring these facilities to establish and implement written food safety plans, which include hazard analyses, written PCs to ensure that significant hazards identified as known or reasonably foreseeable will be significantly reduced or prevented, monitoring of PCs, corrective actions, verification and recordkeeping. Both rules are intended to better protect human and animal health by adopting a modern, preventive and risk-based approach to food safety regulation. Each rule also specifies compliance dates, based on firm size, by which facilities must implement new requirements under the rule. The Human Food PC Rule updates existing Current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cCGMPs\u201d) and the Animal Food PC Rule establishes baseline CGMPs, which set forth minimum current good manufacturing requirements for each of the following areas: personnel, the facility and grounds, sanitation, water supply, equipment and utensils, facility operations and the holding and distribution of the human or animal food. Under these rules, human and animal food facilities will need \u201cPC qualified individuals,\u201d i.e., those with appropriate training or job experience in the development and application of risk-based PCs, to prepare, evaluate and maintain the safety plan and PCs. A supply-chain program and recall plan must also be included in the food safety plans for human and animal food facilities. Large firms, including Darling, are required to comply with most sections of the Human Food PC Rule and the CGMP requirements of the Animal Food PC Rule by September 19, 2016, and with the PC and related portions of the Animal Food PC Rule by September 18, 2017. Compliance dates with respect to supply-chain program requirements under both rules are dependent on when suppliers must comply with applicable rules. On July 29, 2013 FDA proposed a rule regarding verification of foreign suppliers that would extend similar requirements to imported foods intended for humans or animals, and then published a revised proposed rule on September 29, 2014. FDA finalized this rule, entitled \u201cForeign Supplier Verification Program for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals\u201d (\u201cFSVP Rule\u201d) on November 27, 2015. The FSVP Rule establishes requirements for importers of both human and animal food by providing a flexible, risk-based approach to foreign supplier verification consistent with the hazard analysis and risk-based PC requirements for food facilities established in the Human Food PC Rule and Animal Food PC Rule. Under the FSVP Rule, importers of human food and animal food must verify that their\nforeign suppliers produce food in a manner that provides the same level of public health protection as the Human Food PC Rule and Animal Food PC Rule, or FDA\u2019s regulations established under FSMA regarding produce safety, as appropriate, and must ensure that suppliers\u2019 food is not adulterated and is not misbranded with respect to allergen labeling of human food. A foreign supplier verification program must be developed by a qualified individual and include: a written hazard analysis, an evaluation of the risks posed by a food and the foreign supplier\u2019s performance, supplier verification activities to allow the importer to approve the foreign supplier and corrective action procedures. The FSVP Rule designates the importer as the party responsible for supplier verification and for meeting the FSVP Rule requirements. Any required audits must be conducted by a qualified auditor. On February 5, 2014, the FDA proposed new regulations for the sanitary transportation of human and animal foods, which establish sanitary transportation practices that are to be used by shippers, motor vehicle and rail carriers, and receivers engaged in the transportation of food. This rule has not been finalized as of the date of this report. We have followed the FSMA throughout its legislative and rulemaking history and, based on previously published animal food and human food proposed rules, have implemented CGMP, PCs and other procedures at our domestic facilities, which are being reviewed to determine if they comply to the applicable final Human Food PC Rule or Animal Food PC Rule. We are also reviewing similar procedures in place at Darling\u2019s foreign facilities for compliance with the FSVP Rule. Such rulemaking could, among other things, limit our ability to import necessary raw materials or finished products or require us to amend certain of our other operational policies and procedures. Unforeseen issues and requirements may arise as the FDA implements these and other final rules or promulgates other new regulations provided for by the FSMA.\nAs a result of our international operations, we could be adversely affected by additional foreign regulations regarding BSE and other food safety issues. For example, an enforceable ban on the feeding of restricted animal material to ruminant animals was introduced in Australia in 1996. This ban is part of a comprehensive national program to prevent the entry and establishment of the BSE agent in Australia. Inspections and audits are undertaken to ensure compliance. In addition, in the EU, harmonized rules have been adopted for prevention, control and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (\u201cTSEs\u201d), which includes BSE, in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended (\u201cTSE Regulation\u201d) and in other instruments such as Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 on animal by-products (\u201cAnimal by-Products Regulation\u201d) and food and other feed hygiene regulations. The TSE Regulation establishes a \u201cfeed ban,\u201d which is the basic preventive measure against TSE and consists of a ban on the use of processed animal protein (\u201cPAP\u201d) in feed for farmed animals. A ban on the feeding of mammalian PAP to cattle, sheep and goats was first introduced in July 1994. The ban was expanded in January 2001 with the feeding of all PAP to all farmed animals being prohibited, with certain limited exceptions. Only certain animal proteins considered to be safe (such as fishmeal) can be used, and even then under very strict conditions. Other animal-derived products besides PAP, such as collagen and gelatin derived from non-ruminants and hydrolyzed protein derived from parts of non-ruminants or from ruminant hides and skins, are not subject to the \u201cfeed ban.\u201d In June 2013, the \u201cfeed ban\u201d was lifted for the feeding of aquaculture animals and the European Commission has been investigating -the options to lift the ban for other non-ruminants, such as pigs and poultry. Although Darling Ingredients International may profit from the possible lifting of the ban for pigs and poultry, changes to the \u201cfeed ban\u201d may adversely affect Darling Ingredients International, possibly restricting the allowed use of some of their products. The TSE Regulation applies to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin. For that purpose, the BSE status of member states of the EU (\u201cEU Member States\"), non-EU members of the European Economic Area and other countries or regions (such other countries or regions, \u201cThird Countries\u201d) is to be determined by classification into one of three categories depending on the BSE risk involved: a negligible risk, a controlled risk and an undetermined risk. This classification is in line with that of the OIE. The determination of BSE status is based on a risk assessment and the implementation of a surveillance program. For each risk category there are trade rules to provide the necessary guarantees for protecting public and animal health. Currently, the following EU Member States are classified as having a controlled BSE risk: Germany, Greece, Lithuania, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. The other EU Member States are classified as having a negligible BSE risk. A change in the BSE status of one or more EU Member States may have a negative impact on Darling Ingredients International. Under EU legislation, imported products from outside the EU must meet the same safety standards as products produced in EU Member States. Therefore, the TSE Regulation imposes strict import requirements related to TSEs for live animals and animal by-products, such as full traceability of imported animals and animal by-products, a ban on the use of MBM in feed for ruminants and the prohibition of the import of specified risk material or mechanically recovered meat. The detailed import requirements depend on the BSE status of Third Countries. The Animal by-Products Regulation establishes rules intended to prevent the outbreak of certain diseases such as BSE. The Animal by-Products Regulation imposes, for example, rules for the use and disposal of specified risk material and other high risk material. A BSE outbreak or other event viewed as hazardous to animal or human health could lead to the adoption of more stringent rules on the use and disposal of animal by-products, which could require Darling Ingredients International to change its production processes and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by the occurrence of any disease correctly or incorrectly linked to animals.\nThe emergence of diseases such as 2009 H1N1 flu (initially known as \u201cSwine Flu\u201d), highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza (collectively known as \u201cBird Flu\u201d), including H5N1, H7N3, H7N8, H7N9, H10N8 and H5N8 strains of avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (\u201cSARS\u201d) that are in or associated with animals and have the potential to also threaten\nhumans has created concern that such diseases could spread and cause a global pandemic. Bird Flu generally refers to highly aggressive and fatal diseases of birds caused by flu viruses that, once established, can spread rapidly from flock to flock and have also been known to affect humans. Different strains of flu viruses can cause Bird Flu, including, but not limited to the H5, H7 and H10 strains. Each of these flu virus strains may be further divided into subtypes such as H5N1. Human illnesses and deaths have occurred among people having direct contact with poultry infected with the H5N1, as well as other strains of Bird Flu. In 2008, world health experts were concerned that this and other H5 strains of Bird Flu could develop into a global pandemic if the virus adapted further and could be spread from person to person. While cases of people contracting Bird Flus from direct contact with poultry have been reported in China and other parts of Asia, none of these viruses have been spread among humans. To date, the original H5N1 strain thought to potentially cause a human pandemic has not been reported in North America but outbreaks of other H5 strains recently occurred in commercial poultry flocks outside Asia. A H5 strain of Bird Flu was reported on commercial poultry farms in Germany, The Netherlands and in the United Kingdom in November 2014. This same H5 strain was subsequently reported in commercial poultry farms in Western Canada and backyard flocks in the Northwestern United States in December 2014 and commercial turkey farms in California on January 24, 2015. Since these initial reports that the disease had reached Canada and the United States, migratory birds have been blamed for spreading this and two additional H5 strains among commercial poultry flocks in the Midwestern United States and Ontario, Canada. Migratory birds, however, are not believed to be the source of a highly pathogenic strain of H7N8 confirmed on January 15, 2016 in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana. Instead, animal health officials believe a low pathogenic strain of H7N8 present in nearby flocks mutated to be highly pathogenic. This latest outbreak of Bird Flu was confined to a single flock. As of the date of this report, commercial poultry flocks in 15 states were confirmed to have one or more strain of Bird Flu. To date, there have been no reports of humans contracting any of the H5 or H7 strains that occurred recently in Europe, the United States or Canada, nor have there been any reports that these Bird Flu strains can be spread from person to person. The response plans followed by APHIS in the United States to control outbreaks and prevent the spread of Bird Flu include, among other procedures, restricting the movement of poultry and poultry products into or out of the site of infection, using humane methods to depopulate the infected flock or farm and disposal of the euthanized birds on-site to avoid transporting infected material outside the established quarantine zone.\nIn April 2013, the first case of porcine epidemic diarrhea (\u201cPED\u201d) virus was confirmed in the United States on a hog farm in Ohio. The disease has since spread into 33 states in the United States and in Ontario and three other Canadian provinces. The PED virus is highly contagious among pigs, but does not affect other animals and is not transmissible to humans. The effects of the PED virus on hog production will vary according to the age of the pigs affected. Death rates can be very high among young pigs, while symptoms are mild in older animals. Because the PED virus is common in other parts of the world and poses no threat to human health or food safety, its presence in a country or region does not restrict trade in pork or pork products. However, any outbreak that is severe enough to significantly reduce the pig population in a country or region could reduce the availability of pork raw material to our plants. Animal health experts believe the PED virus is spread primarily through contaminated feces, although other transmission routes continue to be studied. On January 30, 2015, scientists in the College of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Minnesota released its report titled \u201cRisk Assessment of Feed Ingredients as Vehicles in the Transmission of the PED Virus.\u201d This risk assessment concluded that the virus is unlikely to survive the rendering process. Therefore, the risk of spreading PED through rendered animal fats and proteins was determined to be negligible. Because data on the effects of spray drying on the virus is limited, the risk of spreading PED through spray dried blood products was determined to be negligible to low. Any reports, proven or perceived, that implicate animal feed or feed ingredients, including but not limited to animal byproducts, as contributing to the spread of the PED virus could negatively affect demand for our products as ingredients in pig feeds in the United States and in Canada.\nFrom December 2002 to June 2003, China and some other countries experienced an outbreak of SARS, a highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia. On July 5, 2003, the World Health Organization declared that the SARS outbreak had been contained. In April 2004, however, a number of isolated new cases of SARS were reported, including in central China.\nAlthough no global disease pandemic among humans has been linked to Bird Flu, Swine Flu, PED virus or SARS as of the date of this report, governments may be pressured to address these concerns, including by executive action such as temporarily closing certain businesses, including meat and animal processing facilities, within their jurisdictions suspected of contributing to the spread of such diseases or by legislative or other policy action, such as prohibiting imports of animals, meat and animal by-products from countries or regions where the disease is detected or suspected. For example, during May and June 2003, many businesses in China were temporarily closed by the Chinese government to prevent transmission of SARS.\nThe EU has enacted several disease control directives, as well as other legislation regarding the notification of animal diseases within the community and veterinary and zootechnical checks, among others. The applicable legislation generally enables the EU to take preventive measures, as well as act promptly in case of an outbreak, by restricting the circulation of livestock and products at risk of being infected within the EU and implementing bans on the imports of such products. For instance, there are preventive measures against Bird Flu that must be implemented by all the EU Member States. In the event of an outbreak of Bird Flu, the Directive 2005/94/EC on the control of avian influenza provides for preventive measures relating to the surveillance and\nthe early detection of Bird Flu and the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of that disease in poultry or other captive birds. The EU Member States are empowered to act quickly in the case of an outbreak by defining protection and surveillance risk zones and adopting measures such as restricting the movement of live poultry and certain poultry products to other EU Member States or to Third Countries. In addition, EU import bans have also been placed on potentially risky poultry products and susceptible imports from Third Countries with Bird Flu outbreaks.\nIf Swine Flu, Bird Flu, the PED virus, SARS or any other disease that is correctly or incorrectly linked to animals and has a negative impact on meat or poultry consumption or animal production occurs in any jurisdiction in which we operate, such occurrence could have a material negative impact on the volume of raw materials available to us or the demand for our finished products.\nIf we or our customers are the subject of product liability claims, product recalls or other product related claims, we may incur significant and unexpected costs and our business reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe and our customers for whom we manufacture products may be exposed to product liability claims and adverse public relations if consumption or use of our products is alleged to cause injury or illness to humans or animals. In addition, we and our customers may be subject to product recalls or other claims resulting from developments relating to the discovery of unauthorized adulterations to food additives or from allegations that our food ingredients were mislabeled, were not produced in accordance with the customer\u2019s specifications and/or have not performed adequately in the end product, even where food safety is not a concern. Product recalls in one jurisdiction may result in product recalls in other jurisdictions, as is the case in the EU, where an EU Member State could recall a product in connection with the recall of such product in another EU Member State. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we incur in connection with product liability claims, whether or not legitimate, or product recalls, whether voluntary or mandatory. We may not be able to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A product liability judgment against us or against one of our customers for whom we manufacture or provide products, or our or their agreement to settle a product liability claim, product recall or other product related claim, could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating income and cash flow. In addition, even if product liability or other claims against us or our customers for whom we manufacture products are not successful or are not fully pursued, defending these claims would likely be costly and time-consuming and may require management to spend time defending the claims rather than operating our business. Any such claim could also result in adverse publicity and negatively impact our reputation.\nProduct liability claims, product recalls or any other events that cause consumers to no longer associate our brands or those of our customers for whom we manufacture products with high quality and safety may harm the value of our and their brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. In addition, as a result of any such claims against us or product recalls, we may be exposed to claims by our customers for damage to their reputations and brands. Product liability claims and product recalls may also lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies of our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our brands, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in consumer preference could negatively impact our business.\nThe food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Trends within the food industry change often, and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reductions for our products or those of our customers for whom we manufacture products, and could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur operations are subject to various laws, rules and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to health and safety, and we could incur significant costs to comply with these requirements or be subject to sanctions or held liable for environmental damages.\nOur operations subject us to various and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety requirements in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the management, storage and disposal of materials in connection with our facilities, occupational health and safety, product packaging and labeling and our handling of hazardous materials and wastes, such as gasoline and diesel fuel used by our trucking fleet and operations. Failure to comply with these requirements could have significant consequences, including recalls, penalties, injunctive relief, claims for personal injury and property and natural resource damages and negative publicity. Our operations require the control of air emissions and odor and the treatment and discharge of wastewater to municipal sewer systems and the environment. We operate boilers at many of our facilities and store wastewater in lagoons or, as permitted, discharge it to publicly owned wastewater treatment systems or surface waters, or through land application. We have incurred significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with\nenvironmental requirements, including for the upgrade of wastewater treatment facilities, and will continue to incur such costs in the future.\nWe could be responsible for the remediation of environmental contamination and may be subject to associated liabilities and claims for personal injury and property and natural resource damages. We own or operate numerous properties, have been in business for many years and have acquired and disposed of properties and businesses over that time. During that time, we or other owners or operators may have generated or disposed of wastes or stored or handled other materials that are or may be considered hazardous or may have polluted the soil, surface water or groundwater at or around our facilities. Under some environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 in the United States, also known as the Superfund law, responsibility for the cost of cleanup of a contaminated site can be imposed upon current or former site owners and operators, or upon any party that sent waste to the site, regardless of the lawfulness of the activities that led to the contamination. Similar laws outside the United States impose liability for environmental cleanup, often under the polluter pays theory of liability but also based upon ownership in some circumstances. There can be no assurance that we will not face extensive costs or penalties that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we have received notice from the EPA relating to alleged river sediment contamination in the Lower Passaic River area of New Jersey. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d In addition, future developments, such as more aggressive enforcement policies, new laws or discoveries of currently unknown contamination conditions, may also require expenditures that may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, increasing efforts to control emissions of GHG are likely to impact our operations. We operate in certain jurisdictions subject to the Kyoto Protocol, which mandates reduced GHG emissions in certain participating countries, and the EPA\u2019s recent rule establishing mandatory GHG reporting for certain activities may apply to some of our facilities if we exceed the applicable thresholds. The EPA has also announced a regulatory finding relating to GHG emissions that has led to further regulation of GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been proposed in the U.S. Congress and a growing number of states and foreign countries are taking action to require reductions in GHG emissions. Future GHG emissions limits may require us to incur additional capital and operational expenditures. EPA regulations limiting exhaust emissions also have become more restrictive, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the EPA have adopted new regulations that govern fuel efficiency and GHG emissions beginning in 2014. Compliance with these and similar regulations could increase the cost of new fleet vehicles and increase our operating expenses. Compliance with future GHG regulations may require expenditures that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have approximately 10,000 employees world-wide and are subject to a wide range of local, provincial and national laws and regulations governing the health and safety of workers, including, for example, OSHA in the United States. We can be subject to potential fines and civil and, in egregious cases, criminal actions if we are found to be in violation of worker health and safety laws in any of these jurisdictions. Further, as such laws and regulations change, we may sometimes be required to commit to unplanned capital expenditures in order to continue to comply with workplace safety requirements at our facilities. In addition, we operate and maintain an extensive vehicle fleet to transport products to and from customer locations in all jurisdictions where we have facilities. Our fleets and drivers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and licensing requirements applicable to commercial fleets, their cargo and their hours and methods of operation. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any location could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nIf we experience difficulties or a significant disruption in our information systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on information systems throughout our business to collect and process data that is critical to our operations and accurate financial reporting. Among other things, these information systems process incoming customer orders and outgoing supplier orders, manage inventory, and allow us to efficiently collect raw materials and distribute products, process and bill shipments to and collect cash from our customers, respond to customer and supplier inquiries, contribute to our overall internal control processes, maintain records of our property, plant and equipment, and record and pay amounts due vendors and other creditors.\nIf we were to experience a disruption in our information systems that involve interactions with suppliers and customers, it could result in a loss of raw material supplies, sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any such disruption could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations. We may also encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties may lead to significant expenses or losses due to unexpected additional costs required to implement or maintain systems, disruption in business operations, loss of sales or profits, or cause us to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties for damages, and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We could also experience impairment of our reputation if any of these events were to occur.\nThe Company is in the process of a multi-year project to replace our existing work management, financial and supply chain software applications with a new suite of systems, including a company-wide enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system. This multi-year project will be extended to the replacement of Rothsay\u2019s system as part of the process of integrating that system with Darling\u2019s systems. We currently do not intend to replace Darling Ingredients International\u2019s system. The ERP system\u2019s implementation process involves a number of risks that may adversely hinder our business operations and/or affect our financial condition and results of operations, if not implemented successfully. The need to implement this project in connection with the integration of the operations of Rothsay could create additional risks. The ERP system\u2019s implementation is a complex and time-consuming project that involves substantial expenditures for implementation consultants, system hardware, software and implementation activities, as well as the transformation of business and financial processes.\nAs with any large software project, there are many factors that may materially affect the schedule, cost, execution and implementation of this project. Those factors include: problems during the design, implementation and testing phases; system delays and/or malfunctions; the risk that suppliers and contractors will not perform as required under their contracts; the diversion of management\u2019s attention from daily operations to the project; re-works due to changes in business processes or financial reporting standards; and other events, some of which are beyond our control. These types of issues could disrupt our business operations and/or our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results and and/or complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Accordingly, material deviations from the project plan or unsuccessful execution of the plan may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely upon our information systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, and we collect and store sensitive data. Increased security threats to information systems and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. A failure of or breach in technology security could expose us and our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operating disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business and results of operations. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.\nOur success is dependent on our key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key employees, including members of senior management. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, motivate and retain skilled technical, managerial, marketing and sales personnel. Competition for these types of skilled personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting, motivating and retaining key personnel. The failure to hire and retain such personnel could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain markets we are highly dependent upon a single operating facility and various events beyond our control could cause an interruption in the operation of our facilities, which could adversely affect our business in those markets.\nOur facilities are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local environmental and other permitting requirements of the countries in which we operate, depending on the locations of those facilities. Periodically, these permits may be reviewed and subject to amendment or withdrawal. Applications for an extension or renewal of various permits may be subject to challenge by community and environmental groups and others. In the event of a casualty, condemnation, work stoppage, permitting withdrawal or delay, severe weather event, or other unscheduled shutdown involving one of our facilities, in a majority of our markets we would utilize a nearby operating facility to continue to serve our customers in the affected market. In certain markets, however, we do not have alternate operating facilities. In the event of a casualty, condemnation, work stoppage, permitting withdrawal or delay, severe weather event or other unscheduled shutdown in these markets, we may experience an interruption in our ability to service our customers and to procure raw materials, and potentially an impairment of the value of that facility. Any of these circumstances may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in those markets. In addition, after an operating facility affected by a casualty, condemnation, work stoppage, permitting withdrawal or delay or other unscheduled shutdown is restored, there could be no assurance that customers who in the interim choose to use alternative disposal services would return to use our services.\nWe could incur a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that would require remediation.\nAny future failures to maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal control over financial reporting, could subject us to a loss of public confidence in our internal control over financial reporting and in the integrity of our financial statements and our public filings with the SEC and other governmental agencies and could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our regulatory reporting obligations in a timely manner. The continued integration of the operations of Darling Ingredients International following the VION Acquisition could create additional risks to our disclosure controls, including our internal controls over financial reporting.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, changes in tax laws or tax rates including potential tax reform in the U.S. to broaden the tax base and reduce deductions or credits, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and material adjustments from tax audits. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs of January 2, 2016, the Company had approximately $1.2 billion of goodwill. We are required to annually test goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred. Additionally, impairment of goodwill must be tested whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations or regulation, or changes in competition. Changes in these factors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance, may affect the fair value of goodwill, which may result in an impairment charge. For example, a deterioration in demand for, or increases in costs for producing, a supplier\u2019s principal products could lead to a reduction in the supplier\u2019s output of raw materials, thus impacting the fair value of a plant processing that raw material. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill become impaired, there may be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be subject to work stoppages at our operating facilities, which could cause interruptions in the manufacturing or distribution of our products.\nWhile we currently have no international, national or multi-plant union contracts, as of January 2, 2016 approximately 23% of Darling\u2019s North American employees, 28% of Rothsay\u2019s employees and 42% of Darling Ingredients International\u2019s employees were covered by various collective bargaining agreements. Furthermore, local laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate provide for worker groups with prescribed powers and rights with regard to working conditions, wages and similar matters. In jurisdictions where such groups do not exist, labor organizing activities could result in additional employees becoming unionized and higher ongoing labor costs. Darling\u2019s collective bargaining agreements expire at varying times over the next five years. In contrast, Darling Ingredients International\u2019s collective bargaining agreements generally have one to two year terms. Rothsay agreements generally have terms up to three years. Some of our collective bargaining agreements have already expired and are in the process of being renegotiated. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of any expiring or expired agreement in a manner acceptable to us. If our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, slowdown or other collective action in the future in any of our locations, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements that could have a direct or indirect adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition.\nLitigation or regulatory proceedings may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a party to several lawsuits, claims and loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of our business, including employment, commercial and contract related matters and assertions by certain regulatory and governmental agencies related to permitting requirements and air, wastewater and storm water discharges from our processing facilities. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, and regulatory proceedings is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs (including governmental\nagencies) in these types of lawsuits and proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits or proceedings may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The costs of responding to or defending future litigation or regulatory proceedings may be significant and any future litigation or regulatory proceedings may divert the attention of management away from our strategic objectives. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation or regulatory proceedings that may decrease customer confidence in our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation or regulatory proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information related to our litigation and regulatory proceedings, see Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nCertain U.S. multiemployer defined benefit pension plans to which we contribute are underfunded and these plans and our European pension funds may require minimum funding contributions.\nWe participate in various U.S. multiemployer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. Based upon the most currently available information, certain of these multiemployer plans are under-funded due partially to a decline in the value of the assets supporting these plans, a reduction in the number of actively participating members for whom employer contributions are required and the level of benefits provided by the plans. In addition, the U.S. Pension Protection Act, which went into effect in January 2008, requires under-funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. Furthermore, under current law, a termination of, our voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan to which we contribute would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. Also, if a multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5% on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers not contributing their allocable share of the minimum funding to the plan. Requirements to pay increased contributions, withdrawal liability and excise taxes could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nIn the EU, pension funds are generally subject to the Institution for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive (Directive 2003/41/EC) (the \u201cIORP Directive\u201d) as implemented in the relevant EU Member States. The IORP Directive provides for certain general solvency requirements but allows EU Member States discretion to impose specific national requirements. As a result, the solvency of EU pension funds are mostly regulated on a national level. The IORP Directive is currently being reformed. In March 2014, the European Commission published a new draft IORP Directive (\u201cIORP Directive II\u201d). The IORP Directive II, as published, does not make substantive changes to the solvency requirements under the current IORP Directive. The IORP Directive II is currently going through the legislative process at the EU level. It is difficult to predict, at this stage, what form the final legislation will take and what impact (if any) it will have on the solvency requirements of pension funds. It is possible that the final legislation could require us to comply with increased minimum coverage requirements, which could burden us and negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nIf the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, if we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our recorded liabilities, if our insurance premiums increase or if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable rates or at all, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur workers compensation, auto and general liability policies contain significant deductibles or self-insured retentions. We develop bi-yearly and record quarterly an estimate of our projected insurance-related liabilities. We estimate the liabilities associated with the risks retained by us, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a degree of variability. If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessments, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, in the future, our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all. Any such inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions, and such acquisitions could result in unknown liabilities, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and require significant management resources.\nWe regularly review potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, services or products. However, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future. Even if we identify appropriate acquisition candidates, we may be unable to complete or finance such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, service or product into our existing business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company also may require significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our business. Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or strategic alliance and such transactions may not generate anticipated financial results. Future acquisitions could also require us to incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or amortize expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could harm our business. Finally, acquisitions may be structured in such a manner that would result in the assumption of unknown liabilities not disclosed by the seller or uncovered during pre-acquisition due diligence.\nTerrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees, facilities, information systems, security systems, suppliers and customers, which could significantly impact our net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition.\nTerrorist attacks, such as those that occurred on September 11, 2001, have contributed to economic instability in the U.S. and in certain other countries, and further acts of terrorism, bioterrorism, cyberterrorism, violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate, our business operations, our expectations and other forward-looking statements contained in this report. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the U.S. and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility, including the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, North Korea, Southeast Asia and Ukraine, may cause economic and political uncertainties and cause our business to suffer in ways that cannot currently be predicted. Events such as those referred to above could cause or contribute to a general decline in investment valuations. In addition, terrorist attacks, particularly acts of bioterrorism, that directly impact our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers could have an impact on our sales, supply chain, production capability and costs and our ability to deliver our finished products.\nOur products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.\nWe maintain valuable trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade names, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property, and consider our intellectual property to be of material value. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our management. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages and cease making or selling certain products. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products and thereby materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe healthcare reform legislation in the United States and its implementation regulations could impact the healthcare benefits we are required to provide our employees in the United States and cause our compensation costs to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (the \u201cACA\u201d), were signed into law in the United States. This healthcare reform legislation and its applicable implementing regulations contain provisions that could materially impact our future healthcare costs, including the contributions we are required to make to our benefit plans. In particular, the requirement that we either offer our full-time employees healthcare coverage that satisfies the ACA's affordability and minimum value standards or potentially be subject to an excise tax penalty became effective in calendar year 2015. In addition, beginning in 2016, we must file information returns with the IRS regarding the health insurance coverage offered to our full-time employees in the prior calendar year. Failure to do so could expose us to reporting penalties under applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code. While the ultimate impact is not yet known, it is possible that these provisions, once implemented, could significantly increase our U.S. compensation costs, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.\nBecause of our prior acquisitions and future acquisitions we may engage in, our historical operating results may be of limited use in evaluating our historical performance and predicting our future results.\nDarling has acquired a number of businesses in recent years, including Rothsay and VION Ingredients, and we expect that we will engage in acquisitions of other businesses from time to time in the future. The operating results of the acquired businesses are included in our financial statements from the date of the completion of such acquisitions. All of Darling\u2019s acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Use of this method has resulted in a new valuation of the\nassets and liabilities of the acquired companies. We expect a substantial increase in our depreciation and amortization and reduction in our operating and net income commensurate with such increase. As a result of these acquisitions and any future acquisitions, our historical operating results may be of limited use in evaluating our historical performance and predicting our future results.\nWe may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility.\nWe periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner. Based on our assessments, we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units, move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility, discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility. The closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has been subject to volatility and, in the future, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Numerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition to the risk factors discussed in this report, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in ingredient prices;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nour earnings releases and financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or buy/sell recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nour ability to repay our debt;\n\u2022\nour access to financial and capital markets to refinance our debt;\n\u2022\nperformance of our joint venture investments, including the DGD Joint Venture;\n\u2022\nour dividend policy;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the industry and the general state of the securities markets;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of us and the industry and markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\ngovernmental legislation or regulation;\n\u2022\ncurrency and exchange rate fluctuations that impact our earnings and balance sheet; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions, such as U.S. or global reactions to economic developments, including regional recessions, currency devaluations or political unrest.\nFuture sales of our common stock or the issuance of other equity may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock or convertible securities, including our outstanding options, or otherwise, will dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is an equity security and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nShares of our common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, the shares of common stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness, including our trade debt, and to other non-equity claims on us and our assets available to satisfy claims on us, including claims in a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings. Our existing indebtedness restricts, and future indebtedness may restrict, payment of dividends on the common stock.\nUnlike indebtedness, where principal and interest customarily are payable on specified due dates, in the case of common stock, (i) dividends are payable only when and if declared by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board and (ii) as a corporation, we are restricted under applicable Delaware law to making dividend payments and redemption payments only from legally available assets. Further, under our certificate of incorporation, there are no restrictions on our business or operations or on our ability to incur indebtedness or engage in any transactions arising as to our common stock, subject only to the voting rights available to stockholders generally.\nIn addition, our rights to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon any liquidation or reorganization of any subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors (except to the extent we may ourselves be a creditor of that subsidiary), including that subsidiary\u2019s trade creditors and our creditors who have obtained or may obtain guarantees from the subsidiaries. As a result, our common stock will be subordinated to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 obligations and liabilities, which currently include borrowings and guarantees. See Item 7. \u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d - \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d, \u201c5.375% Senior Notes due 2022\u201d and \u201c4.75% Senior Notes due 2022.\u201d\nOur ability to pay any dividends on our common stock may be limited and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock since January 3, 1989 and we have no current plans to do so. Our current financing arrangements permit us to pay cash dividends on our common stock within limitations defined by the terms of our existing indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facility and senior notes due 2022 and any indentures or other financing arrangements that we enter into in the future. For example, our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make payments of dividends in cash if certain coverage ratios are not met. Even if such coverage ratios are met in the future, any determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be based upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, plans for expansion, business opportunities, restrictions imposed by any of our financing arrangements, provisions of applicable law and any other factors that our board of directors determines are relevant at that point in time.\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of common stock, which may negatively impact your investment.\nOur board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. The board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred shares that may be issued, including the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights senior to the rights of our common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our business and other terms. If we issue preferred shares in the future that have a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected. As of the date of this report, we have no outstanding shares of preferred stock but we have available for issuance 1,000,000 authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.", "PERMNO": 80928, "SIC": 2070, "TIC": "DAR"}
