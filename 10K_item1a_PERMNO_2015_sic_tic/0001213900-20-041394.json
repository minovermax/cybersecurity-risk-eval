{"cik": "857949", "company": "China Green Agriculture, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in this Report. Our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these risks, which could result in a decline in the market price of our securities, causing you to lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe industry in which we do business is highly fragmented and competitive and we face competition from numerous fertilizer manufacturers in China and elsewhere.\nWe compete with numerous local Chinese fertilizer manufacturers. Although we may have greater resources than many of our competitors, most of which are small local fertilizer companies, it is possible that these competitors have better access in certain local markets, an enhanced ability to customize products to certain regions and better established local distribution channels. We also compete with large national competitors in the PRC. Although we have advanced automated humic acid-based fertilizer production lines and greenhouse supported research and development centers, we cannot assure that such large competitors will not develop their own similar production or research and development facilities. Further, China\u2019s access into the World Trade Organization has led to increased foreign competition for us. International producers and traders import products into China that generally are of higher quality than those produced by the local Chinese manufacturers. If they are localized and become familiar with fertilizers we produce, we may face additional competition. If we are not successful in our research, development and production of new products and/or in our marketing and advertising efforts to increase awareness of our brands, our revenues could decline, which might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nOur major competitors may be able to endure downturns in our industrial sector more than we are. When facing reduced demand for our products, we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing selling prices to meet competition, or to maintain the prices while sacrificing a portion of market share. Our overall profitability likely would be reduced in either case. In addition, we cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our existing markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.\nIf we are unable to design, manufacture, and market fertilizer products in a timely and efficient manner, we may not remain as competitive.\nMany of our fertilizer products are characterized by short product development cycles as they target the unique climate and soil conditions where our customers are located. Accordingly, we devote a substantial amount of resources to product development. To compete successfully, we must develop new and/or improved fertilizer products that cater to customer needs. New fertilizers may not be easily developed. As a result, we may experience performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks and cost overruns. Our inability to develop and offer new and/or improved fertilizer products or to achieve customer acceptance of these products could limit our ability to compete in the market or to grow revenues at a desired rate.\nOur proprietary fertilizer formula may become obsolete or be unintentionally disclosed to competitors, which could materially adversely affect the competitiveness of our future fertilizer products.\nOur proprietary fertilizer formula is the base for producing our fertilizer. Our future success will depend upon our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supplying existing humic acid fertilizer products and by developing new products on a timely basis that keep pace with the evolving industry standards and changing customer requests. If our proprietary formula becomes obsolete because our competitors develop better products, our future business and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with key employees, we cannot assure that if there is a breach of such agreement by an employee, we would not lose any competitive advantage that we currently have with respect to our proprietary fertilizer formula. If we are forced to take legal action to protect our proprietary formula, we will incur significant expense, and a favorable outcome cannot be guaranteed.\nIf our warehouse selling and credit sales of certain fertilizer products continue to increase and we fail to collect the accounts receivables that are due in a timely manner, our financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected.\nWe had accounts receivable of $105,693,326 as of June 30, 2020, as compared to $145,190,160 and $174,460,937 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, decreases of $39,496,834 and decreases of $29,270,777, or 27.2% and 16.8% year over year. The decreases were primarily due to higher allowance for bad debts. The impact of COVID-19 caused some difficulty in accounts receivable collection, resulting in the increase of our allowance for bad debts.\nWe offer a tentative credit period up to 180 days to our customers. Although we perform routine assessment of our customers\u2019 creditworthiness, evaluate the structure and collectability of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when necessary, we may not be able to receive or collect payment for our products on time or at all if our customers encounter difficulties in their businesses. Any such failure may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur concentration of customers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nGufeng\u2019s top five distributors accounted for 82.1% of its revenues, with its largest distributor accounting for 17.7% of total revenues for the 2020 fiscal year. Jinong\u2019s top five distributors accounted for 3.4% of its fertilizer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. If those major customers reduce or discontinue their product purchases from us and we are unable to find their replacements, it will adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may be exposed to intellectual property infringement and the value of our intellectual property rights could diminish.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nJinong is the holder of four registered patents. The first patent is a fertilizer formulation named \u201cMethod and Recipe of the Water Soluble Humic Acid Fertilizers.\u201d The second patent, \u201cProduction Facility of Humic Acid Products,\u201d relates to our proprietary production line and manufacturing processes in the PRC. The third patent is \u201cProduction Method of Organic Fertilizer.\u201d The fourth patent is \u201cProduction method of Multifunctional liquid calcium fertilizer.\u201d Gufeng and Tianjuyuan do not have patents but currently possess seven proprietary technologies. However, we cannot predict the degree and range of protection patents and confidentiality agreements with respect to proprietary technologies will defend us against competitors. Third parties may find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our patents and proprietary technologies. Third parties may attempt to obtain patents claiming aspects like our patent applications. We cannot assure you that our current or potential competitors do not have, and will not obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products in the PRC.\nIf we need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings, such actions may be costly and may divert management attention as well as consume other resources which could otherwise have been devoted to our business. An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, prospects and reputation. In addition, historically, implementation of PRC intellectual property-related laws has been lacking, primarily because of ambiguities in the PRC laws and difficulties in enforcement. Accordingly, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as those in the United States or other countries, which increases the risk that we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property. Moreover, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Future litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, and could disrupt our business, as well as have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Given the relative unpredictability of China\u2019s legal system and potential difficulties enforcing court judgments in China, there is no guarantee that we would be able to halt any unauthorized use of our intellectual property through litigation.\nIf we infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages and compelled to defend against claims by third parties, which, if successful, could cause us to pay significant damage awards and incur other costs.\nOur success also depends in large part on our ability to use and develop our technology and know-how without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. As litigation becomes more common in the PRC in resolving commercial disputes, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. The validity and scope of claims relating to humic acid fertilizer production technology and related devices and machine patents involve complex technical, legal and factual questions and analysis and, therefore, may be highly uncertain. Also, the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel. An adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability, including damage awards to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties (which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all), to pay ongoing royalties, or to redesign our products or subject us to injunctions preventing the manufacture and sale of our products. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products until resolution of such litigation.\nDisruptions in the supply of raw materials used in our products could cause us to be unable to meet customer demand in a timely manner, which could result in the loss of customers and net sales or could result in a lower profit margin for us.\nJinong is supplied with approximately fifty different types of raw materials, of which weathered coal is the primary one as it is the raw material from which humic acid is extracted and applied to the manufacturing of our products. Although there are numerous weathered coal suppliers available in the market, we have been using Inner Mongolia Tianlibao Fertilizer Co., Ltd. (\u201cTianlibao\u201d) as our main supplier of weathered coal because of the abundance and high quality of weathered coal in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Our supply agreement with Tianlibao is renewed monthly. If Tianlibao does not intend to renew the supply agreement with us for any reason, or if there are any business interruptions at Tianlibao and we are unable to locate an alternative supplier in a timely manner or on the same terms, we may not be able to meet customer demand for humic acid-based fertilizers in a timely manner or maintain our standards of quality for humic acid-based fertilizers during the transitional period, which may result in the loss of customers and net sales or we may not be able to keep our profit margin as before for our humic acid-based fertilizers.\nGufeng and Tianjuyuan are supplied with over fifty types of raw materials from a diversified pool of suppliers. Neither Gufeng nor Tianjuyuan are dependent on any single supplier for its raw materials; however, if we experience a significant increase in demand or if we need to replace any of these suppliers, we cannot be assured that the adequate supply of raw materials or a replacement supplier will be acquired in a timely manner to avoid any material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nAny significant fluctuation in our production costs may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe prices for the raw materials and other inputs to manufacture our fertilizer products are subject to market forces largely beyond our control, including the price of weathered coal, energy costs, mineral and non-mineral elements, and freight costs. The costs for these inputs may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in the economy and markets. Although we may pass any increase of such costs to our customers, in the event we are unable to do so, we could incur significant losses and a diminution of our share price.\nWe do not presently maintain business disruption insurance. Any disruption of the operations in our factories would damage our business.\nOur operations could be interrupted by fire, flood, earthquake and other events beyond our control for which we do not carry adequate insurance. While we have property damage insurance and automobile insurance, we do not carry business disruption insurance, which is not readily available in China. Any disruption of the operations in our factories would have a significant negative impact on our ability to manufacture and deliver products, which would cause a potential diminution in sales, the cancellation of orders, damage to our reputation and potential lawsuits.\nWe do not presently maintain product liability insurance, and our property and equipment insurance does not cover the full value of our property and equipment, which leaves us with exposure in the event of loss or damage to our properties or claims filed against us.\nWe currently do not carry any product liability or other similar insurance. We cannot assure that we would not face liability in the event of the failure of any of our products. We also cannot assure you that, especially as China\u2019s domestic consumer economy and industrial economy continues to expand, product liability exposure and litigation will not become more commonplace in the PRC, or that we will not face product liability exposure or actual liability as we expand our sales into international markets where product liability claims could be more prevalent.\nThe occurrence of any acts of God, war, terrorist attacks and other emergencies which are beyond our control may have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nActs of God, war, terrorist attacks and other emergencies which are beyond our control may have a material adverse effect on the economy and infrastructure in the PRC and on the livelihood of the Chinese population. Our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected should such events occur. We cannot give assurance that any acts of God such as floods, earthquakes, drought or any war, terrorist attack or other hostilities in any part of the PRC or even the world, potential or threatened, will not, directly or indirectly, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we cannot renew our fertilizer registration certificates, we will be unable to sell some or all our products. If we do not receive the formal fertilizer registration certificates for our new products, upon the expiration of the temporary registration certificates, we cannot continue to produce such new products.\nAll fertilizers produced in China must be registered with the PRC Ministry of Agriculture. No fertilizer can be manufactured without such registration. There are two kinds of registrations: interim registration and formal registration. The interim registration is valid for one year and applies to fertilizers in the stages of in-the-field testing and test selling. Fertilizers that have completed in-the-field testing and test selling must obtain formal registration, which is valid for five years, and thereafter must be renewed each five years. Jinong has 16 formal registration certificates. Gufeng and Tianjuyuan have 19 interim fertilizer certificates and 259 formal certificates. We plan to apply for formal certificates for each of our interim certificates before the applicable expiration dates.\nOur belief is that the PRC Ministry of Agriculture generally grants an application for renewal in the absence of illegal activity by the applicant. However, there is no assurance that the PRC Ministry of Agriculture will grant renewal of our formal Fertilizer Registration Certificates. If we cannot obtain the necessary renewal, we will not be able to manufacture and sell such fertilizer products without certificates, which will cause the termination of commercial operations for such fertilizer products. With respect to the transformation of the interim fertilizer registration certificates to formal fertilizer registration certificates, we believe that we can receive formal fertilizer registration certificates for our 19 interim fertilizer registration certificates in due course; however, if the government imposes additional burden on the application procedure or put temporary suspension on its certificate granting process due to any unexpected incidents in China, we cannot assure that our formal fertilizer registration certificates can be obtained without delay or can be obtained at all, in which case our production could be adversely affected.\nWe may not possess all the licenses required to operate our business, or may fail to maintain the licenses we currently hold. This could subject us to fines and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition to a fertilizer registration certificate, we are required to hold a variety of other permits, licenses and certificates to conduct our business in China. We may not possess or receive all the permits, licenses and certificates required for our business or for which application has been made. In addition, there may be circumstances under which the approvals, permits, licenses or certificates granted by the governmental agencies are subject to change without substantial notice in advance. If we fail to obtain or to maintain such permits, licenses or certificates or renewals are granted with onerous conditions, we could be subject to fines and other penalties and be limited in the number or the quality of the products that we would be able to offer. As a result, our business, result of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nPotential environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to numerous laws, regulations, rules and specifications relating to the environment, including, among others, the Integrated Emission Standard of Air Pollutants GB 16297-1996 and the Standard of Environmental Noise of Urban Area GB 3096-93. Failure to comply with any laws and regulations and future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us, including civil and criminal penalties, liability for damages and negative publicity. Our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected if we were to be held liable for violating existing environmental regulations or if we were to incur significant expenditures to comply with environmental regulations affecting our operations.\nOur success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nWe depend, to a large extent, on the abilities and participation of our current management team, with a reliance upon Mr. Zhuoyu \u201cRichard\u201d Li, our CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors. The loss of the services of Mr. Li, for any reason, may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. We do not carry key man life insurance for our key personnel.\nThe agricultural chemicals business is specialized and requires the employment of personnel with significant scientific and operational experience in the industry. Accordingly, we must attract, recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically and scientifically competent employees. Our ability to effectively implement our business strategy will depend upon, among other factors, the successful recruitment and retention of additional management and other key personnel that have the necessary scientific, technical and operational skills and experience with the fertilizer industry. These individuals are difficult to find in the PRC and we may not be able to retain such skilled employees. If we are unable to hire individuals with the requisite experience, we may not be able to produce enough products to optimize profits, and the research and development initiatives may be delayed which will negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nMr. Zhuoyu \u201cRichard\u201d Li, our Chairman and CEO may not devote all his time to our business.\nOur Chairman and CEO, Mr. Zhuoyu \u201cRichard\u201d Li, also serves as Chairman of Xi\u2019an Techteam Science & Technology Industry (Group) Co. Ltd., a company engaged in hi-tech application fields in China, and Chairman and CEO of Xi\u2019an Techteam Investment Holding (Group) Co., Ltd, a holding company for certain entities such as Gem Grain. This may give rise to further allocation of Mr. Li\u2019s time to each business. While Mr. Li anticipates having sufficient time to devote to our business, a lack of adequate time spent by him on our business may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to annually furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Such report must contain, among other matters, an assessment by our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including a statement as to whether our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of our fiscal year. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. Performing the system and process documentation and evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is both costly and challenging. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We cannot provide assurance that we will not fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment on an ongoing basis, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe are responsible for the indemnification of our officers and directors.\nOur Bylaws provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against costs and expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on our behalf. Consequently, we may be required to expend substantial funds to satisfy these indemnity obligations.\nOur inability to effectively improve the financial performance of Gufeng may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile Gufeng had sales revenues of $119,623,964, for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, Gufeng\u2019s net income for such period was $(118,168,066). This was primarily due to the lower profit margins on Gufeng\u2019s products, inefficiencies in production and daily operations and negative working capital. In addition, rising transportation costs passed on by Gufeng\u2019s distributors may further erode margins on Gufeng\u2019s products. As Gufeng is based in Beijing, it is susceptible to rising costs of labor common in large cities such as Beijing, which may make it difficult for us to expand the workforce of Gufeng and Tianjuyuan to meet our strategic goals\nAlthough we have made progress in terms of integrating Gufeng\u2019s employees, products and distribution network into our business during the past 12 months, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue effectively to do so, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have not obtained the land use right over the premises on which certain facilities of Gufeng, our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, is located. As a result, the lack of a proper title certificate may jeopardize our right to use the premises and our possession of the buildings we built on such premises.\nThrough Tianjuyuan, we rent approximately 47,333 square meters (509,488 square feet) of land in the Ping Gu District of Beijing (the \u201cPremises\u201d). Under the rental agreement dated February 16, 2004 with the village committee of Dong Gao Village and Zhen Nan Zhang Dai Village in the Beijing Ping Gu District (the \u201crental agreement\u201d), Tianjuyuan rents the land at an annual rent of RMB 35,500 (approximately $5,023). The term of the rental agreement is from February 1, 2004 to January 31, 2054. We were informed by our PRC counsel that the rental agreement is invalid and unenforceable pursuant to the PRC Land Administration Law and related regulations. Therefore, we have been in the process of applying for the proper land use right certificate from the relevant government authorities to legitimize our right over the Premises. As of the date of this report, we were informed by the local government that our application materials for the land use right in issue has been moved up from the department in charge of general matters to the land administrative department of the local government and is under their review. However, there can be no assurance that such land use right certificate will be granted to us. Until we obtain the land use right certificate, there is a risk that the PRC government may declare the rental agreement invalid, evict our personnel from the Premises and tear down the buildings we built on the Premises. As of the date of this Report, we have no knowledge of any pending or threatened governmental actions relating to the Premises.\nA severe or prolonged downturn in the global economy could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe global market and economic conditions during the years 2008 through 2020 were unprecedented and challenging, with recessions occurring in most major economies. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession, energy costs, geopolitical issues, and the availability and cost of credit have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for economic growth around the world. The difficult economic outlook has negatively affected businesses and consumer confidence and contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels.\nThe PRC economy also faces challenges. The PRC government has implemented various measures recently to curb inflation. If economic growth slows or an economic downturn occurs, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in the PRC\nSubstantially all our assets and operations are in the PRC, and substantially all our revenue is sourced from the PRC. Accordingly, our results of operations and financial position are subject to a significant degree to economic, political and legal developments in the PRC, including the following risks:\nChanges in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.\nThe PRC\u2019s economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy, subject to five-year and annual plans adopted by the government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on economic conditions in China. Our interests may be adversely affected by changes in policies by the PRC government, including:\n\u25cf changes in laws, regulations or their interpretation;\n\u25cf confiscatory taxation;\n\u25cf restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies and export tariff;\n\u25cf expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises.\nAlthough the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, we cannot assure you that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting political, economic and social life in China.\nThe PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain. Any changes in such PRC laws and regulations may have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe and any future subsidiaries are considered foreign persons or foreign funded enterprises under PRC laws, and we are subject to PRC laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are sometimes vague and may be subject to future changes, and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations or amendments may be delayed, resulting in detrimental reliance from foreign investors. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations may have on our business.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales in the PRC and any downturn in the Chinese economy could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nSubstantially all our operations are conducted in the PRC and substantially all our revenues are generated from sales in the PRC. We anticipate that revenues from sales of our products in the PRC will continue to represent a substantial proportion of our total revenues soon. Any significant decline in the condition of the PRC economy could, among other things, adversely affect the consumption of our products, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nInflation in the PRC could negatively affect our profitability and growth.\nWhile the PRC economy has experienced rapid growth, it has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our products do not rise at a rate that is sufficient to fully absorb inflation-driven increases in our costs of supplies, our profitability can be adversely affected.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund or IMF, the inflation rate in China fluctuated on an annual basis from a low rate of -1.4% in 1999 to the highest rate of 5.9% in 2008. The inflation rate was 5.2%, 2.7%, and 2.9% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. These fluctuations and economic factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. To control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. The implementation of these and other similar policies can impede economic growth and thereby harm the market for our products.\nRestrictions on investigations by overseas securities regulators.\nUnder Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator can directly conduct investigations or evidence collection activities within the PRC and no entity or individual in China may provide documents and information relating to securities business activities to overseas regulators without Chinese government approval. As a result, our shareholders may not benefit from a regulatory environment that fosters effective enforcement of U.S. and other securities laws. This could adversely affect investor and shareholder protection, and could cause securities exchanges and overseas regulators to impose additional requirements on us.\nOur subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on paying dividends and making other payments to our subsidiary, Green New Jersey; as a result, we might therefore be unable to pay dividends to you.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in the State of Nevada and do not have any assets or conduct any business operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries, Green New Jersey, Jinong, Gufeng, and the VIE companies. Because of our holding company structure, we rely entirely on dividends payments from our subsidiaries in the PRC. PRC regulations currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC accounting standards and regulations, our subsidiaries are also required to set aside a portion of their after-tax profits to fund certain reserves. We may experience difficulties such as lengthy processing time from the foreign exchange administrative bureau\u2019s side and administrative formalities in completing the procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency. Furthermore, if any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or Green New Jersey are unable to receive any profits from the operations of our subsidiaries in the PRC, we may be unable to pay dividends to our common stockholders.\nRisks associated with the VIE structure.\nAs described in \u201cBusiness\u201d above, we operate a portion of our business through variable interest entities (the \u201cVIEs\u201d), including Yuxing and eight other VIEs that we acquired since June 2016. Under agreements with the shareholders of the VIEs, the shareholders retain possession and legal ownership of the equity interests and agree to pledge and entrust all their equity interests, to us or our subsidiaries. In addition, the shareholders of the VIE companies enter into a series of agreements designed to give us operational control of the VIEs, including a Voting Proxy Agreement, an Exclusive Option Agreement, an Equity Pledge Agreement Technology Supply Agreements, and a Non-Compete Agreement. In addition, each of the VIEs enters into an Exclusive Technology Supply Agreements with us or our subsidiaries.\nThere are substantial risks associated with operating through VIEs. Of course, the validity and enforceability of VIE arrangement is subject to any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors\u2019 rights generally, as well as risks related to the discretion of any competent PRC legislative, administrative or judicial bodies in exercising their authority over VIEs. The VIE structure may be determined by Chinese authorities to be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of China, including those related to foreign investment in certain industries, and could be disregarded by PRC tax authorities, resulting in increased tax liabilities.\nIn addition, the VIE structure may not be as effective as direct ownership in controlling entities organized in China, which often hold the licenses necessary to conduct the company\u2019s business in China. Finally, control over funds due from the VIEs could be jeopardized if the shareholders of the VIE breach the terms of the agreements. In rare cases, the VIE structure may result in unauthorized use of indicia of corporate power or authority, such as chops and seals.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of our common stock.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d) into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the PRC. We receive substantially all our revenues in RMB, which is currently not a freely convertible currency. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends, or otherwise satisfy foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from the transaction, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate governmental authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies.\nThe PRC government also may at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay certain of our expenses as they come due.\nThe fluctuation of RMB may materially and adversely affect our common stock.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC\u2019s political and economic conditions. As we rely entirely on revenues earned in the PRC, any significant revaluation of RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and financial condition. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into RMB for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar could lead the RMB equivalent of the U.S. dollars to be reduced and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for making dividend payments on our common stock or for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the RMB, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the RMB we convert would be reduced. In the fiscal year 2020, China\u2019s currency dropped by a cumulative 3.0% against the U.S. dollar on hopes of boosting the domestic economy, making Chinese exports cheaper and imports into China more expensive by that amount. The effect on trade can be substantial. In addition, the depreciation of significant U.S. dollar denominated assets could result in a charge to our income statement and a reduction in the value of these assets.\nPRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC domestic residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial owners to personal liability, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us.\nSAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as \u201cSAFE Circular 75\u201d promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 (the \u201cSAFE Notice\u201d) requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE regarding their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d (the \u201cSPV\u201d). SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under the SAFE Notice, failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth above could result in liability under Chinese law for foreign exchange evasion and may result in penalties and legal sanctions, including fines, the imposition of restrictions on a Chinese subsidiary\u2019s foreign exchange activities and its ability to distribute dividends to the SPV, its ability to pay the SPV proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation in respect of the Chinese subsidiary and the SPV\u2019s ability to contribute additional capital into or provide loans to the Chinese subsidiary. After consultation with China counsel, we do not believe that any of our PRC domestic resident stockholders are subject to the SAFE registration requirement. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all our stockholders who are PRC residents will not be required to make or obtain any applicable registrations or approvals required by these SAFE regulations in the future. The failure or inability of our PRC resident stockholders to comply with the registration procedures set forth therein may subject us to fines and legal sanctions, restrict our cross-border investment activities, or limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute dividends or obtain foreign-exchange-dominated loans to our company.\nAs it is uncertain how the SAFE regulations will be interpreted or implemented, we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our business operations or future strategy. For example, we may be subject to more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the SAFE regulations. This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe may be subject to fines and legal sanctions by SAFE or other PRC government authorities if we or our employees who are PRC citizens fail to comply with PRC regulations relating to employee stock options granted by offshore listed companies to PRC citizens.\nOn March 28, 2007, SAFE promulgated the Operating Procedures for Foreign Exchange Administration of Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Ownership Plans and Stock Option Plans of Offshore Listed Companies, or Circular 78. Under Circular 78, Chinese citizens who are granted share options by an offshore listed company are required, through a Chinese agent or Chinese subsidiary of the offshore listed company, to register with SAFE and complete certain other procedures, including applications for foreign exchange purchase quotas and opening special bank accounts. We and our Chinese employees who have been granted share options are subject to Circular 78. Failure to comply with these regulations may subject us or our Chinese employees to fines and legal sanctions imposed by SAFE or other PRC government authorities and may prevent us from further granting options under our share incentive plans to our employees. Such events could adversely affect our business operations.\nOur business and financial performance may be materially adversely affected if the PRC regulatory authorities determine that our acquisition of Jinong constitutes a Round-trip Investment without the PRC Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d) approval.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies promulgated the Regulation on Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors (the \u201c2006 M&A Rules\u201d), which became effective on September 8, 2006. According to the 2006 M&A Rules, a \u201cRound-trip Investment\u201d is defined as having taken place when a PRC business that is owned, directly or indirectly, by PRC individual(s) is sold to a non-PRC entity that is established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by those same PRC individual(s) and their PRC affiliates. Under the 2006 M&A Rules, any Round-trip Investment must be approved by the MOFCOM. The application of the 2006 M&A Rules with respect to the definition of Round-trip Investment remains unclear, with no consensus currently existing among the leading PRC law firms regarding the definition, scope of the applicability of the MOFCOM approval.\nWe, through Green New Jersey, acquired 100% of the capital stock of Jinong (the \u201cJinong Acquisition.\u201d) Jinong is a PRC business whose stockholders were two PRC individuals and a PRC entity, of which Mr. Tao Li, our former Chairman and CEO, was the controlling stockholder, holding 31% of its shares. The PRC regulatory authorities could take the view that the Jinong Acquisition may be part of a Round-trip Investment. The PRC legal counsel of Jinong has opined that the Jinong Acquisition did not violate any PRC law, which would include the 2006 M&A Rules. We, however, cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authority, MOFCOM, will take the same view as the PRC legal counsel. If the PRC regulatory authorities take the view that the Jinong Acquisition constitutes a Round-trip Investment under the 2006 M&A Rules, we cannot be assured that we may be able to obtain the approval required from MOFCOM.\nIf the PRC regulatory authorities take the view that the Jinong Acquisition constitutes a Round-trip Investment without MOFCOM approval, they could invalidate our acquisition and ownership of Jinong. Additionally, the PRC regulatory authorities may take the view that the Jinong Acquisition constitutes a transaction which requires the prior approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, before MOFCOM approval is obtained. We believe that if this takes place, we may be able to find a way to re-establish control of Jinong\u2019s business operations through a series of contractual arrangements rather than an outright purchase of Jinong. We cannot assure you that such contractual arrangements will be protected by PRC law or that we can receive as complete or effective economic benefit and overall control of Jinong\u2019s business than if the Company had direct ownership of Jinong. In addition, we cannot assure you that such contractual arrangements can be successfully effected under PRC law. If we cannot obtain MOFCOM or CSRC approval if required by the PRC regulatory authorities to do so, and if we cannot put in place or enforce relevant contractual arrangements as an alternative and equivalent means of control of Jinong, our corporate structure could be materially adversely affected.\nJinong\u2019s contractual arrangements with Yuxing may result in adverse tax consequences to us.\nWe could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that Jinong\u2019s contractual arrangements with Yuxing were not made on an arm\u2019s length basis and adjust our income and expenses for PRC tax purposes in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could result in a reduction, for PRC tax purposes, of adjustments recorded by Yuxing, which could adversely affect us by increasing Yuxing\u2019s tax liability without reducing Jinong\u2019s tax liability, which could further result in late payment fees and other penalties to Yuxing for underpaid taxes.\nWe control Yuxing through contractual arrangements which may not be as effective in providing control over Yuxing as direct ownership, and if Yuxing or its shareholders breach the contractual arrangements, we would have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law, which may not be available or effective, to enforce or protect our rights.\nEffective June 16, 2013, we conduct substantially all our operations on agriculture products, and generate substantially all our revenues from agriculture products, through contractual arrangements with our VIE, Yuxing, that provide us, through our ownership of Green New Jersey and its ownership of Jinong, with effective control over Yuxing. We have no direct ownership interest in Yuxing. We depend on Yuxing to hold and maintain agriculture products contracts with our customers. Yuxing also owns substantially all our property, facilities and other assets relating to the operation of our agriculture products business, and employs the personnel for substantially all our agriculture products business. Neither we nor Jinong has any direct ownership interest in Yuxing. Although we believe that that each contract under Jinong\u2019s contractual arrangements with Yuxing is valid, binding and enforceable under current PRC laws and regulations in effect, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with control over Yuxing as direct ownership of Yuxing would be. In addition, Yuxing may breach the contractual arrangements. For example, Yuxing may decide not to make contractual payments to Jinong, and consequently to us, in accordance with the existing contractual arrangements. In the event of any such breach, we would have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law. These remedies may not always be available or effective, particularly considering uncertainties in the PRC legal system.\nYuxing may also seek to renew its agreements on terms that are disadvantageous to us. Although we have entered into a series of agreements that provide us with substantial ability to control Yuxing, we may not succeed in enforcing our rights under them insofar as our contractual rights and legal remedies under PRC law are inadequate. If we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms when these agreements expire or enter into similar agreements with other parties, our business may not be able to operate or expand, and our operating expenses may significantly increase.\nIn addition, although we do not rely on Yuxing\u2019s revenue, Yuxing\u2019s VIE structure is subject to uncertainty amid the PRC\u2019s changing legislative practice. In January 2015, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce unveiled draft legislation that could change how the government regulates corporate structures, especially for VIEs controlled by foreign investments. Instead of looking at \u201cownership,\u201d the draft law focuses on the entities or individuals who control a VIE. If a VIE is deemed to be controlled by foreign investors, it may be barred from operating in restricted sectors or the prohibited sectors listed on a \u201cnegative list,\u201d where only companies controlled by Chinese nationals could operate, even if structured as VIEs.\nIf the draft law is implemented in any form, and the Company\u2019s business is characterized as one of the \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d sectors, Yuxing may be barred from operation, which would materially adversely affect our business.\nPRC laws and regulations governing our businesses and the validity of certain of our contractual arrangements are uncertain. If we are found to be in violation of such PRC laws and regulations, we could be subject to sanctions. In addition, changes in such PRC laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business.\nThere are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business, or the enforcement and performance of Yuxing\u2019s contractual arrangements with Jinong. Jinong is considered a foreign invested enterprise under PRC law. As a result, Jinong is subject to PRC law limitations on its businesses and foreign ownership of Chinese companies. These laws and regulations are relatively new and may be subject to change, and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations or amendments may be delayed, resulting in detrimental reliance by foreign investors. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively.\nThe PRC government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business and other licenses and requiring actions necessary for compliance. Licenses and permits issued or granted to us by relevant governmental bodies may be revoked later by higher regulatory bodies. We cannot predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations on our businesses. We cannot assure you that our current ownership and operating structure would not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws or regulations. As a result, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines, and could be required to restructure our operations or cease to provide certain services. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe PRC environmental laws and regulations may adversely impact on our business.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to numerous environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. These laws, ordinances and regulations address and regulate, among other matters, wastewater discharge, air quality and the generation, handling, storage, treatment, disposal and transportation of solid and hazardous waste. It is possible that compliance with a new regulatory requirement could impose significant compliance costs on us. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased global focus on environmental and social issues could result in the adoption of more stringent standards in these areas by the PRC.\nWe believe that we have obtained all permits, licenses and approvals, and filed all registrations required for the conduct of our business, except where the failure to obtain such permit, license or approval, or file any registration would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have not been notified by any governmental authority of any continuing noncompliance, liability or other claim relating to any of our properties or business operations, nor are we aware of any other material environmental condition with respect to any of our properties or arising out of our business operations at any other location.\nHowever, no assurance can be given that all potential environmental liabilities have been identified or properly quantified or that any prior owner, operator, or tenant has not created an environmental condition unknown to us. Moreover, no assurance can be given that (i) future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or (ii) the current environmental condition of the properties will not be affected by the condition of land or operations near the properties (such as the presence of underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to us.\nPRC regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds we receive from any offerings to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nWe are a holding company in the United States conducting our operations in China through our PRC subsidiaries. In utilizing the proceeds we may receive from any offerings, we may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, whether currently in existence or to be formed in the future, or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries.\nAny loans we make to our PRC subsidiaries cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE, or its local counterparts. Under applicable PRC law, the government authorities must approve a foreign-invested enterprise\u2019s registered capital amount, which represents the total amount of capital contributions made by the stockholders that have registered with the registration authorities. In addition, the authorities must also approve the foreign-invested enterprise\u2019s total investment, which is equal to the company\u2019s registered capital plus the amount of stockholder loans it is permitted to borrow under the law. The ratio of registered capital to total investment cannot be lower than the minimum statutory requirement. If we make loans to our operating subsidiaries in China that do not exceed the current maximum amount of borrowings, we will have to register each loan with SAFE or its local counterpart for the issuance of a registration certificate of foreign debts. In practice, it could be time-consuming to complete such SAFE registration process. Alternatively, or concurrently with the loans, we might make capital contributions to our operating subsidiaries in China and such capital contributions involve uncertainties of their own. Further, SAFE promulgated a new circular (known as Circular 142) in August 2008 with respect to the administration of conversion of foreign exchange capital contributions of a foreign-invested enterprise. The circular clarifies that RMB converted from foreign exchange capital contributions can only be used for the activities within the approved business scope of such foreign-invested enterprise and cannot be used for domestic equity investments unless otherwise permitted.\nWhile we do not foresee this to happen soon, with respect to future loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries or with respect to future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries, we cannot be assured that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, when the need arises. If circumstances call and if we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds we receive from this offering and to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely and materially affect our ability to fund and expand our business.\nIf we were to be deemed as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d by PRC tax authorities, we could be subject to tax on our global income at the rate of 25% under the Enterprise Income Tax Law (\u201c2008 EIT Law\u201d) in the PRC and our non-PRC shareholders could be subject to certain PRC taxes.\nUnder the 2008 EIT Law and the implementing rules, both of which became effective January 1, 2008, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within the PRC may be considered a PRC \u201cresident enterprise\u201d and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. The implementing rules of the 2008 EIT Law define \u201cde facto management\u201d as \u201csubstantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties\u201d of the enterprise. If we were to be considered a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d by the PRC tax authorities, our global income would be taxable under the 2008 EIT Law at the rate of 25% and, to the extent we were to generate a substantial amount of income outside of PRC in the future, we would be subject to additional taxes. In addition, the dividends we pay to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and gains derived by such shareholders from the transfer of our shares may also be subject to PRC withholding tax at the rate up to 10%, if such income were regarded as China-sourced income. In addition, the circular mentioned above details that certain Chinese-invested enterprises controlled by Chinese enterprises or Chinese group enterprises will be classified as \u201cresident enterprises\u201d if the following are located or resident in China: senior management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management; financial and personnel decision making bodies; key properties, accounting books, company seal, and minutes of board meetings and stockholders\u2019 meetings; and half or more of the directors with voting rights or senior management. However, as of the date hereof, no final interpretation on the implementation of the \u201cresident enterprise\u201d designation is available. Moreover, any such designation, when made by PRC tax authorities, will be determined based on the facts and circumstances of individual cases. As a result, we cannot determine the likelihood or consequences of our being designated a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d as of the date hereof.\nIf the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d we may be subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide income and dividends paid by us to our non-PRC stockholders as well as capital gains recognized by them with respect to the sale of our stock may be subject to a PRC withholding tax. This will have an impact on our effective tax rate, a material adverse effect on our net income and results of operations, and may require us to withhold tax on our non-PRC stockholders.\nBecause our principal assets are located outside of the United States and because almost all our directors and officers reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult for you to use the United States Federal securities laws to enforce your rights against us and our officers and most of our directors or to enforce judgments of United States courts against us or most of our directors and officers in the PRC.\nAlmost all our present officers and directors reside outside of the United States; accordingly it may be difficult to serve them with process in case of a legal action against them. In addition, our operating subsidiaries are in the PRC and substantially all their assets are located outside of the United States. It may therefore be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the United States Federal securities laws against us or our officers and directors in the courts of either the United States or the PRC and, even if civil judgments are obtained in courts of the United States, to enforce such judgments in PRC courts. It is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and the PRC would permit effective enforcement against us or most of our directors and officers of criminal penalties, under the United States Federal securities laws or otherwise. In addition, enforcement of a foreign judgment in the PRC may be limited or otherwise affected by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, arrangement, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors\u2019 rights generally and will be subject to a statutory limitation of time within which proceedings may be brought.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur in the PRC. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business, which would put us at a disadvantage. We can make no assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have difficulty managing the risk associated with doing business in the Chinese fertilizer and agricultural products sectors.\nIn general, the fertilizer and agricultural products sectors in China are affected by a series of factors, including, but not limited to, natural, economic and social such as climate, market, technology, regulation, and globalization, which makes risk management difficult. Fertilizer and agricultural products operations in China face similar risks as present in other countries; however, in the PRC these can either be mitigated or exacerbated due to governmental intervention through policy promulgation and implementation either in the fertilizer and agricultural products or sectors which provide critical inputs to fertilizer and agricultural products such as energy or outputs such as transportation. While not an exhaustive list, the following factors could significantly affect our ability to do business:\n\u25cf food, feed, and energy demand including liquid fuels and crude oil;\n\u25cf agricultural, financial, energy and renewable energy and trade policies;\n\u25cf input and output pricing due to market factors and regulatory policies;\n\u25cf production and crop progress due to adverse weather conditions, equipment deliveries, and water and irrigation conditions; and\n\u25cf infrastructure conditions and policies.\nCurrently, we do not hold and do not intend to purchase insurance policies to protect revenue in the case that the above conditions cause losses of revenue.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Stock.\nWe may not pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe paid a cash dividend on January 30, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of October 31, 2014. However, we may not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and we may not have sufficient funds legally available to pay dividends. Even if the funds are legally available for distribution, we may nevertheless decide not to pay, or may be unable to pay, any dividends. At present we intend to retain all earnings for our company\u2019s operations.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, which may adversely affect the price at which you can sell our shares.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operations results;\n\u25cf filing of a class action lawsuit against us and certain of our current and former officers;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u25cf conditions in foreign or domestic fertilizer and agricultural markets;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies in the same industry;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf fluctuations of exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. dollar;\n\u25cf intellectual property litigation;\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in the PRC; and\n\u25cf Other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe may require additional financing in the future and our operations could be curtailed if we are unable to obtain required additional financing when needed.\nWe may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing to fund future capital expenditures. Additional equity may result in dilution to the holders of our outstanding shares of capital stock. Additional debt financing may include conditions that would restrict our freedom to operate our business, such as conditions that:\n\u25cf limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek consent for the payment of dividends;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nA SEC investor bulletin regarding reverse mergers may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nOn June 9, 2011, the SEC issued an investor bulletin in which it explained the process by which a company becomes a public company by means of a reverse merger, described the potential risks of investing in a reverse merger company and detailed recent enforcement actions taken by it against certain reverse merger companies. The investor bulletin raised specific concerns with respect to foreign companies that access the U.S. markets through the reverse merger process, as we did. The SEC investor bulletin could lead investors in our common stock to sell their shares and may cause other investors not to invest in us, thus driving down the market price of our common stock or making it more difficult for us to raise funds in the future.\nStockholders should have no expectation of any dividends in the future.\nWe paid a cash dividend on January 30, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of October 31, 2014. However, the Board of Directors may not intend to declare any dividends on our common stock soon, but instead currently intends to retain all earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our business. If we decide to pay dividends, foreign exchange and other regulations in China may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from China or convert those payments from Renminbi into foreign currencies.\nIf our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIf our common stock were removed from listing with the New York Stock Exchange, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. Investors in penny stocks should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose their whole investment.", "PERMNO": 92897, "SIC": 2870, "TIC": "CGA"}
