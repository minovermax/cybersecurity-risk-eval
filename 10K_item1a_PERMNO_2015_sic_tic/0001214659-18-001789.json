RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear at the end of this report. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties, including those that we do not currently consider material, may impair our business. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the value of our securities to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with two assets in the clinical stage of development. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2004. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $434.4 million. Substantially all our losses resulted from costs incurred with our product development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nOur historical losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may incur significant sales, marketing, in-licensing and outsourced manufacturing expenses as well as continued product development expenses. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant losses over the next several years as we continue to advance our product candidates into clinical studies and as we:\n\u00b7\ncontinue clinical development of Sollpura and blisibimod;\n\u00b7\nmanufacture our drug product candidates for use in clinical trials and to support future applications for marketing approval; and\n\u00b7\nhire additional clinical, scientific and management personnel, if needed.\nOur future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors. These factors include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe progress of clinical studies of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of manufacturing our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\ndelays that may be caused by evolving requirements of regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish, enforce and maintain selected strategic alliances; and\n\u00b7\nthe acquisition of technologies, product candidates and other business opportunities that require financial commitments.\nWe have never generated any product revenue and may never be profitable.\nOur ability to generate product revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, conduct clinical studies in patients, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates and commercialize any approved products. We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term. However, as a result of the collaborative arrangement that we entered into with Zenyaku in December 2014 for the development of blisibimod, we began recognizing license fee revenue and collaborative revenue in 2015. The license fee revenue from the collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku was initially amortized as revenue over the performance obligation period (product development period) while reimbursement for our full-time employees (\u201cFTEs\u201d) was recorded as collaborative revenues as incurred. In September 2015, Zenyaku provided us a notice of its intent to terminate the Zenyaku Agreement, effective January 7, 2016. The termination was \u201cat will\u201d and Zenyaku alleged no breach of the Zenyaku Agreement by us. Because of an early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement, we did not recognize revenues under the Zenyaku Agreement beyond January 2016.\nThe commercial success of our development-stage product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u00b7\nobtain favorable results for and advance the development of Sollpura, our product candidate for the treatment of patients with low digestive enzyme levels and potentially other diseases;\n\u00b7\nobtain favorable results for and advance the development of blisibimod, our product candidate for the treatment of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including successfully launching and completing clinical studies in patients with IgA nephropathy, or other indications related to the development of blisibimod;\n\u00b7\nobtain regulatory approval for Sollpura and blisibimod;\n\u00b7\nif regulatory approvals are obtained, begin the commercial manufacturing of our product candidates with third-party manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nlaunch commercial sales and effectively market our product candidates, either independently or in strategic collaborations with third parties; and\n\u00b7\nachieve broad market acceptance of our product candidates in the medical community and with third-party payors.\nOur product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of therapeutics based on new technologies. Our product candidates have failed in clinical studies because we were unable to demonstrate that they were effective. Furthermore, our products candidates could fail if they cause unacceptable adverse effects in the patients we treat. Failure of our product candidates in clinical studies will have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or become profitable. If we are not successful in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe will need substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations. If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.\nWe anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2017, together with the net proceeds of $11.1 million from the second closing of a private placement of our equity securities and $3.1 million from warrant exercises and sale of common stock pursuant to an equity purchase agreement subsequent to December 31, 2017 will not be sufficient to fund our operations for next twelve months from the filing of this report, which results in substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to:\n\u00b7\ndelay our regulatory submission for Sollpura;\n\u00b7\nsignificantly modify, reduce the scope of, delay ongoing clinical studies and manufacturing activities for Sollpura;\n\u00b7\nterminate, reduce or delay our (i) establishment of sales and marketing capabilities, (ii) pursuit of strategic collaborations with others relating to the sales, marketing and commercialization of our product candidates or (iii) other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for sale.\nThe substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of the date of this report is not alleviated after consideration of management\u2019s plans to mitigate such concerns. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nIf we are unable to continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose their entire investment. In order for us to continue as a going concern beyond our current projected cash runway of the second quarter of 2018, we will be required to obtain capital from external sources, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling debt securities, if convertible, further dilution to our existing stockholders may result. Furthermore, we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable.\nWe plan to meet our capital requirements primarily through issuances of equity securities, potential partnerships, debt financing, and in the longer term, revenue from product sales. We may be forced to obtain funds through collaborations with potential collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we may otherwise seek to develop or commercialized independently. Failure to generate revenue or raise additional capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our intended business objectives.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors including:\n\u00b7\nthe scope, size, rate of progress, results and costs of our clinical studies and other development activities for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing campaigns for clinical materials, including data to support the application for marketing approval, formulation development and product enhancement;\n\u00b7\nnon-clinical activities that we may pursue parallel to our clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nthe filing, prosecution and enforcement of patent claims;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with commercializing our product candidates if they receive regulatory approval, including the cost and timing of developing sales and marketing capabilities, or entering into strategic collaboration with others relating to the commercialization of our product candidates; and\n\u00b7\nrevenues received from approved products, if any, in the future.\nThe timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to our licensors is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nIn December 2007, we entered into the Amgen Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod. Pursuant to the Amgen Agreement, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives for any blisibimod formulation. We are required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones. We are also required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low teens as net sales increase.\nIn July 2014, we entered into the Lilly Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to Sollpura. Pursuant to the Lilly Agreement, we are required to make various milestone payments upon our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial objectives for any Sollpura formulation. We are also required to make tiered royalty payments on net sales, which percentage increases from the high single digits to the mid-teens as net sales increase.\nIn March 2015, we received a research award of up to $3 million from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated (\u201cCFFT\u201d) for the development of Sollpura. Under the research award agreement, we are obligated to pay royalties to CFFT as follows: i) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the five times the award, payable in three installments between the first and second anniversaries of the first commercial sale of a product; ii) a one-time royalty in an amount equal to the actual award after net product sales reaches $100 million; and iii) in the event of a license, sale or other transfer of the product or a change of control transaction prior to the commercial sale of the product, a milestone payment equal to three times the actual award.\nThe timing of our achievement of these events and corresponding milestone payments becoming due to our licensors is subject to factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of our product candidates, as applicable, many of which are beyond our control. We may become obligated to make a milestone payment during a period in which we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical studies, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts, seek funds to meet these obligations at terms unfavorable to us or default on our license agreements, which could result in license termination.\nRisks Associated with Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe depend substantially on the success of our product candidates which are still under clinical development. We cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nTo date, we have not obtained marketing approval for, or marketed, distributed or sold any products. The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully.\nOur product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidates for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well- controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA and, with respect to approval in other countries, similar regulatory authorities in those countries, that the product candidates are safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate. Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not:\n\u00b7\noffer therapeutic or other improvement over existing, comparable therapeutics;\n\u00b7\nbe proven safe and effective in clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nmeet applicable regulatory standards;\n\u00b7\nbe capable of being produced in sufficient quantities at acceptable costs;\n\u00b7\nbe successfully commercialized; or\n\u00b7\nobtain favorable reimbursement.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until the FDA approves our biologics license applications, or BLAs, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries. We have not submitted any BLA or received marketing approval for our product candidates.\nPreclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and uncertain processes. We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical study could also cause the FDA or us to terminate a clinical study or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical studies. Additionally, data obtained from a clinical study are susceptible to varying interpretations and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our clinical studies less favorably than we do. The FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may decide that our data are insufficient to support a marketing application and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.\nFrom time to time during the regulatory approval process of our product candidates, we engage in discussions with the FDA and other non-US regulatory authorities regarding the regulatory requirements for our development programs. We may receive informal verbal and or written guidance from these authority agencies which may help form the basis of our clinical trial designs. The FDA and other non-US regulatory agencies may change their position on such informal guidance prior to the approval of our product candidates. As a result, we are unable to determine whether the outcome of informal deliberations will become final. If we are unable to effectively and efficiently resolve and comply with inquiries and requests from the FDA and other non-US regulatory authorities, the approval of our product candidates may be delayed and their value maybe be reduced.\nAny termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, clinical testing of our product candidates could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospect.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs. We do not know whether planned clinical studies will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u00b7\nobtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical study or complying with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical study;\n\u00b7\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and study sites;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing, including manufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidates or other materials for use in clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nobtaining IRB, approval or the approval of other reviewing entities to conduct a clinical study at prospective sites;\n\u00b7\nrecruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical studies for a variety of reasons, including size of patient population, nature of clinical study protocol, the availability of approved effective treatments for the relevant disease and competition from other clinical study programs for similar indications;\n\u00b7\nsevere or unexpected drug-related adverse effects experienced by patients in a clinical study; and\n\u00b7\nretaining patients who have initiated a clinical study, but may withdraw due to treatment protocol, adverse effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy from the treatment, personal issues or who are lost to further follow-up.\nClinical studies may also be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results. In addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the IRB or other reviewing entity overseeing the clinical study at issue, at any of our clinical study sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nfailure to conduct the clinical study in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u00b7\ninspection of the clinical study operations or study sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen safety issues or any determination that a clinical study presents unacceptable health risks; and\n\u00b7\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties.\nProduct development costs to us will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of our product candidates or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned. We typically rely on third-party clinical investigators at medical institutions and health care facilities to conduct our clinical studies and, as a result, we may face additional delays outside our control.\nAdditionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend clinical development plans or clinical study protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical study protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical study. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Also, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.\nBecause the results of preclinical testing or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into clinical studies may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug or biologic. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 clinical studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical studies. Despite the results reported in earlier clinical studies for our product candidates, we do not know whether any Phase 3 or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates. If later stage clinical studies do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted. Even if we believe that our product candidates have performed satisfactorily in preclinical testing and clinical studies, we may nonetheless fail to obtain FDA or other regulatory authority approval for our product candidates.\nIf we breach the license agreements for our product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe are party to the Amgen Agreement, which provides for the exclusive worldwide licenses of the compositions of matter and methods of use for blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive worldwide licenses of compositions of matter and methods of use relating to peptibodies generally. We are also party to the Lilly Agreement, which provides for an exclusive worldwide license of the compositions of matter, formulation, and methods of use patents for Sollpura. These agreements require us to make timely milestone and royalty payments, provide regular information, maintain the confidentiality of and indemnify our licensors under the terms of the agreements.\nIf we fail to meet these obligations, our licensors may terminate our licenses and may be able to re-obtain licensed technologies and aspects of any intellectual properties controlled by us that relate to the licensed technologies that originated from our licensors. Our licensors could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of the licensed product candidates after an uncured, material breach of our license agreements by us or if we voluntarily terminate the agreements. While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents and patent applications licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the license agreements could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for our product candidates.\nOur industry is subject to intense competition. If we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidates may be rendered non-competitive or obsolete.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and more established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. All of these competitors currently engage in, have engaged in or may engage in the future in the development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies, some of which may compete with our present or future product candidates. It is possible that any of these competitors could develop technologies or products that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive, which could adversely affect our revenue potential. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.\nThe market for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is also highly competitive. There are currently several marketed products for EPI caused by cystic fibrosis in the U.S., including Creon marketed by AbbVie, Inc., Pancreaze by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Zenpep and Viokace by Allergan, and Pertzye by Chiesi. We are also aware of companies with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of EPI caused by cystic fibrosis: AzurRx Biopharma\u2019s MS1819 lipase is currently being tested in a Phase 2 trial in patients with chronic pancreatitis; and Alcresta Therapeutics markets RELiZORB, a lipase enzyme cartridge designed for use by adults receiving nutrition by enteral tube who have trouble digesting and absorbing ingested fats.\nMany of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, and in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors\u2019 drugs may be more effective, have fewer adverse effects, be less expensive to develop and manufacture or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidates we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. These entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete. All of these factors could adversely affect our business.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of any approved label.\nUndesirable adverse effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, IRBs or other reviewing entities, clinical study sites, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nSollpura, which we licensed from Eli Lilly in July 2014, received a complete response letter (\u201cCRL\u201d) from the FDA while it was under development by Eli Lilly in April 2011. Eli Lilly has attempted to address the material items highlighted by the FDA in the CRL and worked directly with the FDA on a clinical development program for Sollpura which, if successful, could result in regulatory approval of Sollpura. There are still open items from the CRL that we will need to address with the FDA. While we plan to make reasonable efforts to accommodate and address the FDA\u2019s inquiries and requests, we are unable to determine the final outcome of the CRL. Any delay in addressing the CRL to the satisfaction of the FDA may result in postponement of our Phase 3 clinical trial of Sollpura in patients with EPI.\nIf serious adverse events related to our product candidates are observed in any Phase 3 clinical studies, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted. Further, if our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later discover, after approval and use in an increasing number of patients, that our products could have adverse effect profiles that limit their usefulness or require their withdrawal (whether or not the therapies showed the adverse effect profile in Phase 1 through Phase 3 clinical studies), a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of or revoke the licenses for the products;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to change the way the products are administered, conduct additional clinical studies or change the labeling of the products;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market approval and acceptance of the affected product candidates and could substantially increase the costs of commercialization.\nAfter the completion of our clinical studies, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from the product candidates.\nEven if we project positive clinical results and file for regulatory approval, we cannot commercialize any product candidate until the clinical and drug manufacturing data have been generated and submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities, and they have reviewed and approved the applications for such product candidate. We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates we develop. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and FDA regulatory review.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. For example, the label ultimately approved for blisibimod or Sollpura, if any, may include restrictions on use. Further, the FDA has indicated that long-term safety data on blisibimod may need to be obtained as a post-market requirement. Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing procedures, or cGMP, regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with our product candidates, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the products are manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on the products, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the products from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u00b7\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval or revoke a license;\n\u00b7\nsuspend any ongoing clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u00b7\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nIf our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenue that we generate from their sales, if any, will be limited.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n\u00b7\nthe relative convenience, ease of administration and acceptance by physicians and payors of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u00b7\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling;\n\u00b7\navailability of alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.\nIf our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third- party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.\nThe use of product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical study participants;\n\u00b7\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u00b7\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize product candidates; and\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.\nOur product liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If and when we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nIf we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials. We could be held liable for any contamination, injury or other damages resulting from these hazardous substances. In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products. While third parties are responsible for disposal of our hazardous waste, we could be liable under environmental laws for any required cleanup of sites at which our waste is disposed. Federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations at any time, or if they change, we may be subject to criminal sanctions and substantial civil liabilities, which may harm our business. Even if we continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and our resultant liability for any injuries or other damages caused by these accidents.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and those third parties may perform in an unsatisfactory manner, such as by failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of these clinical studies, or may harm our business if they suffer a catastrophic event.\nWe rely on third parties such as CROs, medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Our reliance on these third parties, however, does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application, such as the investigational new drug application, or IND. In addition, the CROs with whom we contract may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our preclinical studies or clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical study design. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be delayed or prevented. In addition, if a catastrophe such as an earthquake, fire, flood or power loss should affect one of the third parties on which we rely, our business prospects could be harmed. For example, if a central laboratory holding all of our clinical study samples were to suffer a catastrophic loss of their facility, we would lose all of our samples and would have to repeat our studies.\nAny failure by our third-party manufacturers on which we rely to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies and on which we intend to rely to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have relied upon a small number of third-party manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient formulators for the manufacture of our material for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future. We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our product candidates if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates or market them.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates in accordance with our product specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval. In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the FDA to withdraw approvals previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production or injunction.\nWe rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce drug product for our clinical studies. There are a small number of suppliers, and in some instances, a single supplier for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture drug product. Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials and equipment to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials and equipment by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Although we generally do not begin a clinical study unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of product candidates to complete the clinical study, any significant delay in the supply of product candidates or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical study due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained, the commercial launch would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply of such product candidates, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of such product candidates.\nBecause of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at a cost or in quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products. If we successfully commercialize a product candidate, we may be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities. In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity. We have no experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, which may not occur on a timely basis.\nSome of our manufacturing suppliers are located overseas, and the transportation of drug supplies to or from these facilities to their intended destinations is subject to certain risks of loss and damage beyond our control. Additionally, the importation of drug supplies into and from foreign countries is subject to customs regulations that may require us to incur additional regulatory costs.\nAny delays in the development and validation of drug manufacturing processes for commercialization could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospect.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of drug manufacturing could significantly affect our readiness to commercialize our drug products. We do not know whether planned manufacturing processes will be successful or be completed on schedule. The development and validation of drug manufacturing processes can be delayed for numerous reasons, including delays related to:\n\u00b7\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective chemical manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation;\n\u00b7\nlack of availability of raw materials;\n\u00b7\nlack of adequate funding to continue the development and validation of drug manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7\ninability to demonstrate of robustness of the process at our CMOs;\n\u00b7\nequipment failure that results in the loss of some or all of a batch of manufactured drug;\n\u00b7\nirregularities or errors in shipping between manufacturing facilities or distributors that result in the loss of some or all of a batch of drug; and\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable natural forces that may render the CMO temporarily or permanently incapable of manufacturing our drugs.\nDrug manufacturing may also be delayed, suspended or changed as a result of advice from regulatory authorities such as the FDA or other international regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nfailure of the CMO to conform with appropriate quality standards; and\n\u00b7\ninspection of the CMO by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a manufacturing hold.\nAdditionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend our manufacturing plans or processes to reflect these changes. Amendments to the processes may impact the costs, timing or successful completion development and validation of the drug manufacturing processes for commercialization. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, product commercialization may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Also, if product commercialization is delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable. We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may adversely affect the use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval.\nGovernment agencies issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our product candidates. In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health or science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the medical and patient communities. These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage and use of related or competing therapies. Changes to these recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nRecently enacted and future legislation or regulatory requirements or reform of the health care system in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nNew federal legislation or regulatory requirements could affect the requirements for obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates or otherwise limit our ability to commercialize any approved products or subject our products to more rigorous post-approval requirements. New legislation and additional proposals if enacted, may make it more difficult or burdensome for us to obtain approval of our product candidates, any approvals we receive may be more restrictive or be subject to onerous post-approval requirements, our ability to successfully commercialize approved products may be hindered and our business may be harmed as a result.\nOur ability to commercialize our future products successfully, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. For example, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:\n\u00b7\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u00b7\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u00b7\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u00b7\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;\n\u00b7\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u00b7\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u00b7\nexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u00b7\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u00b7\nnew requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u00b7\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u00b7\ncreation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, if and when impaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and\n\u00b7\nestablishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.\nSince its enactment, however, there have been modifications and challenges to numerous aspects of the ACA:\n\u00b7\nIn 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court heard challenges to the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the viability of certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision upheld most of the Healthcare Reform Act and determined that requiring individuals to maintain \u201cminimum essential\u201d health insurance coverage or pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service was within Congress\u2019s constitutional taxing authority. However, as a result of tax reform legislation passed in late December 2017, the individual mandate has been eliminated. The long ranging effects of the elimination of the individual mandate on the viability of the ACA are unknown at this time.\n\u00b7\nOn January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.\n\u00b7\nOn October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017.\n\u00b7\nCMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.\nIn 2018, litigation, regulation, and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. The full impact of the ACA, any law repealing. replacing, and/or modifying elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation on our business remains unclear.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted that, directly or indirectly, affect or are likely to affect, the pharmaceutical industry and the commercialization of our products, including: the Budget Control Act of 2011; the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012; the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act (\u201c MMA\u201d); and the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. We expect that any of these, as well as any healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nIndividual U.S. state governments have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. The continuing efforts of government and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may limit our commercial opportunity. It will be time-consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors. Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and government and third- party private health insurance coverage and reimbursement may not be available to patients for any of our future products or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the MMA, attempts to repeal, replace, or modify the ACA, additional prescription drug coverage legislation, and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future. In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we or any potential collaborators could receive for any of our future products and could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn some foreign countries, including major markets in the EU and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. Such pharmacoeconomic studies can be costly and the results uncertain. Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and others will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our product candidates, if approved. Our future arrangements with third-party payors will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our product candidates, if we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u00b7\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\u00b7\nThe federal false claims laws impose criminal and civil penalties, including those from civil whistleblower or qui tam actions pursuant to the federal False Claims Act, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.\n\u00b7\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\n\u00b7\nThe federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\n\u00b7\nThe federal transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the \u201cSunshine Act,\u201d under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests.\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\n\u00b7\nFederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.\n\u00b7\nAnalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing.\nEnsuring that our future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations, including anticipated activities to be conducted by our sales team, were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines and exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Mr. Craig Thompson, our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. William R. Shanahan, our Chief Medical Officer, Ms. May Liu, our Chief Accounting Officer, Dr. Renee Martin, our Senior Vice President, Medical Sciences, and the other principal members of our executive team. The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and possibly sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions. Failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Investment in Our Common Stock\nWe are subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price has been and may continue to be volatile. Companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We are a target of this type of litigation. For example, on February 13, 2017, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California captioned Brian Clevlen v. Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:17- cv-715, on behalf of a putative class of the Company\u2019s stockholders against the Company and certain of its current and former officers that was voluntarily dismissed, as discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile, which could result in the decline of the value of your investment in our common stock or class action litigation against us and our management, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe market price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including:\n\u00b7\nplans for, progress in and results from clinical studies for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including those pertaining to patents patent applications held by our licensors;\n\u00b7\nfailure of any of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions and overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our operating results, or the operating results of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our financial guidance or securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u00b7\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u00b7\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of any of our key personnel;\n\u00b7\nannouncements related to litigation;\n\u00b7\nchanging legal or regulatory developments in the United States and other countries; and\n\u00b7\ndiscussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our securities have been relatively thinly traded. Investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of the stock. Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock. Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Capital Market in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock. Securities litigation against us, including as discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture sales of our common stock by the selling stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nAs of February 28, 2018, there were 23,397,497 shares of our common stock outstanding. In addition, we had outstanding 2,067,522 shares of Class Y Convertible Preferred Stock that are convertible into 2,067,522 shares of common stock, and options and warrants to purchase 26,520,407 shares of our common stock that, if converted and exercised, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale. A large portion of these shares and outstanding equity awards are held by a small number of persons and investment funds. Sales by these stockholders or option holders in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, which may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nWe will need to seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaboration, strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOperating as a public company increases our expenses and administrative burden.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, our administrative staff will be required to perform additional tasks. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Capital Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. We must also bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.\nIn particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our stock price could decline, and we could face sanctions, delisting or investigations by The Nasdaq Capital Market, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the value of their stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\na classified and staggered board of directors whose members can only be dismissed for cause;\n\u00b7\nthe prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe limitation on who may call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe establishment of advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which would increase the number of outstanding shares and could thwart a takeover attempt; and\n\u00b7\nthe requirement of at least 75% of the outstanding common stock to amend any of the foregoing provisions.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability to us.\nGenerally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporation\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An ownership change may limit a company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change. We underwent ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 ownership of the Internal Revenue Code during 2012 and in January 2018, as such, our net operating loss carryforwards are limited. In addition, the pre-change R&D tax credits have also been limited for federal tax purposes. If we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which will result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe may be unable to issue securities under our shelf registration statement, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nWe have filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. The registration statement is subject to Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3, which imposes a limitation on the maximum amount of securities that we may sell pursuant to the registration statement during any twelve-month period. When we sell securities pursuant to the registration statement, the amount of securities to be sold plus the amount of any securities we have sold during the prior twelve months in reliance on Instruction I.B.6. may not exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of a day during the 60 days immediately preceding such sale, as computed in accordance with Instruction I.B.6. Based on this calculation and the current market value of our outstanding common stock, we expect that we will be significantly limited to selling additional securities pursuant to our effective registration statement on Form S-3, unless and until the market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates increases significantly. If we cannot sell securities under our shelf registration, we may be required to utilize more costly and time-consuming means of accessing the capital markets, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and cash position.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf our or our licensors\u2019 patent positions do not adequately protect our product candidates or any future products, others could compete with us more directly or prevent us from commercializing our products, which would harm our business.\nWe hold license rights to U.S. numerous European (\u201cEP\u201d), and non-EP foreign patents and patent applications relating to blisibimod and Sollpura. Our Sollpura portfolio is made up of exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Eli Lilly. Our blisibimod portfolio is made up of exclusively and non-exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Amgen, as well as U.S. and Patent Cooperation Treaty (\u201cPCT\u201d) patent applications owned by us.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent positions, particularly those patents for which we have secured exclusive rights, as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidates and any future products in the United States and other countries. If we or our licensors do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. We and our licensors will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u00b7\nany of our or our licensors\u2019 pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u00b7\nany of our or our licensors\u2019 patents will be valid or enforceable;\n\u00b7\nany patents issued to us or our licensors and collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies or product candidates that are patentable; or\n\u00b7\nthe patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are aware of two third-party issued United States patents that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides. Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents. If we were to challenge the validity of either of these issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent\u2019s claims. There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits. If third party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and in addition may require us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product. Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.\nWe license patent rights from third-party owners. If we, or such owners, do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.\nWe are party to a license agreement with Amgen that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the novel BAFF inhibitor blisibimod, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to peptibody compositions and formulations. We are also a party to a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company that provides exclusive and worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Sollpura, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain technology relating to Sollpura compositions and formulations.\nWe depend in part on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering blisibimod and Sollpura. Our licensors are responsible for maintaining certain issued patents and prosecuting certain patent applications. We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on maintaining these patent rights and prosecuting these patent applications to our advantage. Our licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights. We may have limited, if any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the United States or other countries. Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense against third-party claims of infringement. We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on defense of such third-party claims of infringement.\nOur success will depend in part on the ability of us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. We or our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed. Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendment and similar foreign legislation to extend our licensed patent terms and/or we do not obtain market exclusivity for our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed.\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendment provides for an extension of patent term for drug compounds for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in clinical testing and the regulatory approval process. If the USPTO grants a five-year patent term extension for Sollpura and for blisibimod and if we continue to have rights under our license agreements with respect to both, our exclusive rights to one of Sollpura\u2019s U.S. composition of matter patents could extend until 2030 or 2033 and our exclusive rights to one of blisibimod\u2019s U.S. composition of matter patents could extend until 2027 or 2028. In Europe, similar legislative enactments allow patent terms in the European Union to be extended for up to five years through the grant of a Supplementary Protection Certificate. If each European country where we seek such grants a five-year extension for Sollpura and for blisibimod and if we continue to have rights under our license agreements with respect to both, our exclusive rights to Sollpura\u2019s European composition of matter patents could extend until 2026 or 2030, and our exclusive rights to blisibimod\u2019s European composition of matter patents could extend until 2027 in those European countries.\nHowever, we may not be granted an extension in a particular country if we, for example, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period of the extension or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration of the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors, including manufacturers of generic alternatives, may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nFurther, since neither Sollpura nor blisibimod have been previously approved in the U.S., both may be eligible for 12 years of biologic data exclusivity from the FDA. During this data exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator biologic\u2019s safety and efficacy data to gain approval.\nSimilarly, the European Union provides that companies who receive regulatory approval for a new small biologic will have a 10-year period of data exclusivity for that biologic (with the possibility of a further one-year extension) in most EU countries, beginning on the date of such European regulatory approval, regardless of when the European composition of matter patent covering such biologic expires. A generic version of the approved drug may not be marketed or sold during such market exclusivity period. The law governing biologic data exclusivity in the U.S. is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for Sollpura or blisibimod. For example, there is a risk that the 12-year period of exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider Sollpura or blisibimod to be a reference product for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for Sollpura or blisibimod in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nThere is no assurance that we will receive extensions for our patents available under the Hatch-Waxman Amendment or similar foreign legislation, or that we will receive data exclusivity or other exclusive marketing rights. If we fail to receive such extensions or exclusivities or if we receive extensions or exclusivity periods that are materially shorter than expected, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling biosimilars of our products will be materially harmed.\nOur current patent positions and license portfolio may not include all patent rights needed for the full development and commercialization of our product candidates. We cannot be sure that patent rights we may need in the future will be available for license to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe typically develop product candidates using compounds for which we have in-licensed and original composition of matter patents and patents that claim the activities and methods for such compounds\u2019 production and use to the extent known at that time. As we learn more about the mechanisms of action and new methods of manufacture and use of product candidates, we may file additional patent applications for these new inventions or we may need to ask our licensors to file them. We may also need to license additional patent rights or other rights on compounds, treatment methods or manufacturing processes because we learn that we need such rights during the continuing development of our product candidates.\nAlthough our in-licensed and original patents may prevent others from making, using or selling similar products, they do not ensure that we will not infringe the patent rights of third parties. We may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make, use or sell our product candidates. For example, because we sometimes identify the mechanism of action or molecular target of a given product candidate after identifying its composition of matter and therapeutic use, we may not be aware until the mechanism or target is further elucidated that a third party has an issued or pending patent claiming biological activities or targets that may cover our product candidates. U.S. patent applications filed after November 29, 2000 are confidential in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the first 18 months after such applications\u2019 earliest priority date, and patent offices in non-U.S. countries often publish patent applications for the first time six months or more after filing. Furthermore, we may not be aware of published or granted conflicting patent rights. Any conflicts resulting from patent applications and patents of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection. If others obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may need to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology.\nWe may not be able to obtain any licenses or other rights to patents, technology or know-how from third parties necessary to conduct our business as described in this report and such licenses, if available at all, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates or proposed product candidates, which would harm our business. Litigation or patent interference proceedings may be necessarily brought against third parties, as discussed below, to enforce any of our patents or other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity or enforceability of the proprietary rights of such third parties.\nLitigation regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming. If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing product candidates to market and harm our ability to operate.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to manufacture, use, sell and offer to sell our product candidates and proposed product candidates without infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Although we are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. Likewise, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our or our licensors\u2019 existing or future patents.\nProceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions relating to our product candidates or the enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product candidates.\nEven if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have our patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages; encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market; or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or methods of treatment requiring licenses.", "PERMNO": 93300, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ANTH"}
