Risk Factors\nYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events described below were to occur, our financial condition, our ability to access capital resources, our results of operations and/or our future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks related to our business\nOur operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these quarterly and annual fluctuations include the following factors, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this prospectus supplement:\n\u00b7\nadverse developments in litigation we are pursuing for infringement of our intellectual property and potential forfeiture of bonds relating to such developments;\n\u00b7\ndisputes regarding intellectual property rights and the possibility of our U.S. patents being reexamined or reviewed by the USPTO and PTAB or our foreign patents being subjected to invalidation proceedings with their respective authorities;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and management attention diversion associated with litigation and any appeals we may pursue;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions, including the possibility of a prolonged period of limited economic growth in the U.S. and Europe; disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere;\n\u00b7\nour inability to develop new or enhanced products that achieve customer or market acceptance in a timely manner, including our HyperCloud\u00ae memory module, our NVvaultTM and Hypervault family of products and our flash- based memory products;\n\u00b7\nour failure to maintain the qualification of our products with our current customers or to qualify current and future products with our current or prospective customers in a timely manner or at all;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of actual or anticipated introductions of competing products or technologies by us or our competitors, customers or suppliers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to procure an adequate supply of key components, particularly DRAM ICs and NAND flash;\n\u00b7\nthe loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, a key customer;\n\u00b7\nthe cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\na reduction in the demand for our high performance memory subsystems or the systems into which they are incorporated;\n\u00b7\nour customers\u2019 failure to pay us on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\ncosts, inefficiencies and supply risks associated with outsourcing portions of the design and the manufacture of integrated circuits;\n\u00b7\nour ability to absorb manufacturing overhead if our revenues decline or vary from our projections;\n\u00b7\ndelays in fulfilling orders for our products or a failure to fulfill orders;\n\u00b7\ndependence on large suppliers who are also competitors and whose manufacturing priorities may not support our production schedules;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the prices of our products or in the cost of the materials that we use to build our products, including fluctuations in the market price of DRAM ICs and NAND;\n\u00b7\nour ability to effectively operate our manufacturing facility in the PRC;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start-up of new manufacturing operations, new products and initiation of volume production or disruption due to power outages, natural disasters or other factors;\n\u00b7\nour failure to produce products that meet the quality requirements of our customers;\n\u00b7\nthe loss of any of our key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in regulatory policies or accounting principles;\n\u00b7\nour ability to adequately manage or finance internal growth or growth through acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of our investments and financing arrangements on our liquidity; and\n\u00b7\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this prospectus supplement.\nDue to the various factors mentioned above, and others, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance. In one or more future periods, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline regardless of our operating performance.\nWe have historically incurred losses and may continue to incur losses.\nSince the inception of our business in 2000, we have only experienced one fiscal year (2006) with profitable results. In order to regain profitability, or to achieve and sustain positive cash flows from operations in the future, we must further reduce operating expenses and/or increase our revenues and gross margins. Although we have in the past engaged in a series of cost reduction actions, and believe that we could reduce our current level of expenses through elimination or reduction of strategic initiatives, such expense reductions alone may not make us profitable or allow us to sustain profitability if it is achieved. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend on increased revenue growth from, among other things, our ability to monetize our intellectual property, increased demand for our memory subsystems and related product offerings, as well as our ability to expand into new and emerging markets. We may not be successful in achieving the necessary revenue growth or the expected expense reductions. Moreover, we may be unable to sustain past or expected future expense reductions in subsequent periods. We may not achieve profitability or sustain such profitability, if achieved, on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.\nAny failure to achieve profitability could result in increased capital requirements and pressure on our liquidity position. We believe our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our levels of net sales, the timing and extent of expenditures to support sales, marketing, research and development activities, the expansion of manufacturing capacity both domestically and internationally and the continued market acceptance of our products. Our capital requirements could result in our having to, or otherwise choosing to, seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Such funding may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, either of which could result in our inability to meet certain of our financial obligations and other related commitments.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain, and we may need to raise additional funds, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe believe our existing cash balances, borrowing availability under our bank credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d), borrowing availability under our loan agreement with Fortress Credit Opportunities I LP (\u201cFortress\u201d), an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC and successor to DBD Credit Funding LLC, net of cash expected to be used in operations, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need significant additional capital, which we may seek to raise through, among other things, public and private equity offerings and debt financings. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our levels of net sales, the timing and extent of expenditures to support research and development activities and patent infringement litigation, the expansion of manufacturing capacity both domestically and internationally and the continued market acceptance of our products. Additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization. If adequate working capital is not available when needed, we may be required to significantly modify our business model and operations to reduce spending to a sustainable level. It could cause us to be unable to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or customer requirements. It may also cause us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, or to reduce or cease operations.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.\nAt the present time, we intend to use available funds to finance our operations. Accordingly, while payment of dividends rests within the discretion of our board of directors, no cash dividends on our common shares have been declared or paid by us and we have no intention of paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.\nWe have incurred a material amount of indebtedness to fund our operations, the terms of which require that we pledge substantially all of our assets as security and that we agree to share certain patent monetization revenues that may accrue in the future. Our level of indebtedness and the terms of such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.\nWe have incurred debt secured by all of our assets under our credit facilities and term loans with Fortress and SVB. Our credit facility with Fortress is secured by a first-priority security interest in our intellectual property assets (other than certain patents and related assets relating to the NVvault\u2122 product line) and a second priority security interest in substantially all of our other assets. Our credit facility with SVB is secured by a first priority security interest in all of our assets other than our intellectual property assets, to which SVB has a second priority security interest. The credit facility with Fortress contains customary representations, warranties and indemnification provisions, as well as affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things restrict our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u00b7\nincur liens;\n\u00b7\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate or merge\n\u00b7\nsell or exclusively license assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nalter our business;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make distributions.\nThe credit facilities also include events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, certain bankruptcy events, and certain material adverse changes. If we were to default under either credit facility and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default, interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate. In the case of a default, the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the credit agreements and exercise their rights to foreclose on their security interests, which would cause substantial harm to our business and prospects.\nIncurrence and maintenance of this debt could have material consequences, such as:\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash requirements;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in, our business and industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all.\nConcurrently with the execution of the credit facility with Fortress, we entered into a Monetization Letter Agreement (as amended, the \u201cLetter Agreement\u201d), which provides, among other things, that Drawbridge Special Opportunities Fund LP (\u201cDrawbridge\u201d) may be entitled to share in certain monetization revenues that we may derive in the future related to our patent portfolio. We amended the Letter Agreement on February 17, 2015. Monetization revenues subject to this arrangement include revenues recognized during the seven year term of the Letter Agreement\nfrom net amounts actually paid to us or our subsidiaries in connection with any assertion of, agreement not to assert, or license of, our patent portfolio, including revenues arising from litigation. Monetization revenues subject to the arrangement also include the value attributable to our patent portfolio in any sale of the Company during the seven year term, subject to a maximum amount. The Letter Agreement also requires that we use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue opportunities to monetize our patent portfolio during the term of the Letter Agreement, provided that we are under no obligation to pursue any such opportunities that we do not deem to be in our best interest in our reasonable business judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts, and we may expend resources in pursuit of monetization revenues that may not result in any benefit to us. Moreover, the revenue sharing obligation will reduce the benefit we receive from any monetization transactions, which could adversely affect our operating results and would reduce the amounts payable to our stockholders in the event of a sale transaction.\nOur revenues and results of operations have been substantially dependent on NVvault\u2122 and we may be unable to replace revenue lost from the rapid decline in prior generation NVvault\u2122 sales to Dell.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, our NVvault\u2122 non-volatile RDIMM used in cache-protection and data logging applications, including our NVvault\u2122 battery-free, the flash-based cache system, accounted for approximately 44% and 39% of total net sales, respectively. Following Intel\u2019s launch of its Romley platform in the first quarter of 2012, we have experienced a rapid decline in NVvault\u2122 sales to Dell, and we recognized no NVvault\u2122 sales to Dell in the fiscal year ended December 27, 2014, as compared to $5.5 million in the year ended December 28, 2013. We expect no future demand from Dell for our DDR2 NVvault\u2122. In order to leverage our NVvault\u2122 technology and diversify our customer base, and to secure one or more new key customers other than Dell, we continue to pursue additional qualifications of NVvault\u2122 with other OEMs and to target customer applications such as online transaction processing (\u201cOLTP\u201d), virtualization, big data analytics, high speed transaction processing, high performance database, and in-memory database applications. We also introduced EXPRESSvault\u2122 in March 2011, and we continue to pursue qualification of next generation DDR3 NVvault\u2122 with customers. Our future operating results will depend on our ability to commercialize these NVvault\u2122 product extensions, as well as other products such as HyperCloud\u00ae and HyperVault and other high-density and high-performance solutions. HyperVault is still under development and may require substantial additional investment. We may not be successful in expanding our qualifications or in marketing any new or enhanced products.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our focus on developing our HyperCloud\u00ae and NVvault\u2122 products and lack of market diversification.\nWe have historically derived a substantial portion of our net sales from sales of our high performance memory subsystems for use in the server market. We expect these memory subsystems to continue to account for a portion of our net sales in the near term, although we may be unable to meet customer demand for our HyperCloud\u00ae or NVvault\u2122 products in future periods if we experience disruptions in the supply of raw materials. We believe that continued market acceptance of these products or derivative products that incorporate our core memory subsystem technology for use in servers is critical to our success.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our research and development budget into the design of ASIC and hybrid devices, including the HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystem, introduced in November 2009, as well as our NVvault family of products. These designs and the products they are incorporated into are subject to increased risks as compared to our legacy products. For example:\n\u00b7\nwe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for both the DRAM ICs and the ASIC devices that are essential to the functionality of the HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystem, and we have experienced supply chain disruptions and shortages of DRAM and flash required to create our HyperCloud\u00ae, NVvault and Planar X VLP products as a result of business issues that are specific to our suppliers or the industry as a whole;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to achieve new qualifications or customer or market acceptance of the HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystem or other new products, or achieve such acceptance in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nthe HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystem or other new products may contain currently undiscovered flaws, the correction of which would result in increased costs and time to market; and\n\u00b7\nwe are required to demonstrate the quality and reliability of the HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystem or other new products to our customers, and are required to qualify these new products with our customers, which requires a significant investment of time and resources prior to the receipt of any revenue from such customers.\nWe experienced a longer qualification cycle than anticipated with our HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystems, and as a result, we have not generated significant HyperCloud\u00ae product revenues to date relative to our investment in the product. We entered into collaborative agreements with both IBM and HP pursuant to which these OEMs qualified the 16GB and 32GB versions of HyperCloud\u00ae for use with their products. While we and each of the OEMs committed financial and other resources toward the collaboration, the efforts undertaken with each of these collaborative agreements have not resulted in significant product margins for us to date relative to our investment in developing and marketing these products. We must secure an adequate supply of DRAM in order to continue to sell our HyperCloud\u00ae product in future periods and, even assuming we are successful in maintaining an adequate supply, we cannot provide any assurances that we will achieve sufficient revenues or margins from our HyperCloud\u00ae products.\nAdditionally, if the demand for servers deteriorates or if the demand for our products to be incorporated in servers declines, our operating results would be adversely affected, and we would be forced to diversify our product portfolio and our target markets. We may not be able to achieve this diversification, and our inability to do so may adversely affect our business.\nWe use a small number of custom ASIC, DRAM ICs and NAND suppliers and are subject to risks of disruption in the supply of custom ASIC, DRAM ICs and NAND.\nOur ability to fulfill customer orders or produce qualification samples is dependent on a sufficient supply of DRAM ICs and NAND, which are essential components of our memory subsystems. We are also dependent on a sufficient supply of custom ASIC devices to produce our HyperCloud\u00ae memory modules. There are a relatively small number of suppliers of DRAM ICs and NAND, and we purchase from only a subset of these suppliers. We have no long-term DRAM or NAND supply contracts.\nFrom time to time, shortages in DRAM ICs and NAND have required some suppliers to limit the supply of their DRAM ICs and NAND. We have experienced supply chain disruptions and shortages of DRAM and flash required to create our HyperCloud\u00ae, NVvault and Planar X VLP products, and we are continually working to secure adequate supplies of DRAM and flash necessary to fill customers\u2019 orders for our products in a timely manner. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of DRAM ICs or NAND flash to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, these customers may reduce future orders for our products or not purchase our products at all, which would cause our net sales to decline and harm our operating results. In addition, our reputation could be harmed and, even assuming we are successful in resolving supply chain disruptions, we may not be able to replace any lost business with new customers, and we may lose market share to our competitors.\nAdditionally, we could face obstacles in moving production of our ASIC components away from our current design and production partners. Our dependence on a small number of suppliers and the lack of any guaranteed sources of ASIC components, DRAM and NAND supply expose us to several risks, including the inability to obtain an adequate supply of these important components, price increases, delivery delays and poor quality.\nHistorical declines in customer demand and our revenues caused us to reduce our purchases of DRAM ICs and NAND. Such fluctuations could occur in the future. Should we not maintain sufficient purchase levels with some suppliers, our ability to obtain supplies of raw materials may be impaired due to the practice of some suppliers to allocate their products to customers with the highest regular demand.\nOur customers qualify the ASIC components, DRAM ICs and NAND of our suppliers for use in their systems. If one of our suppliers should experience quality control problems, it may be disqualified by one or more of our\ncustomers. This would disrupt our supplies of ASIC components, DRAM ICs and NAND and reduce the number of suppliers available to us, and may require that we qualify a new supplier. If our suppliers are unable to produce qualification samples on a timely basis or at all, we could experience delays in the qualification process, which could have a significant impact on our ability to sell that product.\nWe may lose our competitive position if we are unable to timely and cost-effectively develop new or enhanced products that meet our customers\u2019 requirements and achieve market acceptance.\nOur industry is characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and rapid product obsolescence. Evolving industry standards and technological change or new, competitive technologies could render our existing products obsolete. Accordingly, our ability to compete in the future will depend in large part on our ability to identify and develop new or enhanced products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and to respond to changing customer requirements. In order to develop and introduce new or enhanced products, we need to:\n\u00b7\nidentify and adjust to the changing requirements of our current and potential customers;\n\u00b7\nidentify and adapt to emerging technological trends and evolving industry standards in our markets;\n\u00b7\ndesign and introduce cost-effective, innovative and performance- enhancing features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\ndevelop relationships with potential suppliers of components required for these new or enhanced products;\n\u00b7\nqualify these products for use in our customers\u2019 products; and\n\u00b7\ndevelop and maintain effective marketing strategies.\nOur product development efforts are costly and inherently risky. It is difficult to foresee changes or developments in technology or anticipate the adoption of new standards. Moreover, once these things are identified, if at all, we will need to hire the appropriate technical personnel or retain third party designers, develop the product, identify and eliminate design flaws, and manufacture the product in production quantities either in-house or through third-party manufacturers. As a result, we may not be able to successfully develop new or enhanced products or we may experience delays in the development and introduction of new or enhanced products. Delays in product development and introduction could result in the loss of, or delays in generating, net sales and the loss of market share, as well as damage to our reputation. Even if we develop new or enhanced products, they may not meet our customers\u2019 requirements or gain market acceptance.\nOur customers require that our products undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of net sales.\nOur prospective customers generally make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate our memory subsystems prior to purchasing our products and integrating them into their systems. This extensive qualification process involves rigorous reliability testing and evaluation of our products, which may continue for nine months or longer and is often subject to delays. In addition to qualification of specific products, some of our customers may also require us to undergo a technology qualification if our product designs incorporate innovative technologies that the customer has not previously encountered. Such technology qualifications often take substantially longer than product qualifications and can take over a year to complete. Qualification by a prospective customer does not ensure any sales to that prospective customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of our products to a customer, changes in our products, our manufacturing facilities, our production processes or our component suppliers may require a new qualification process, which may result in additional delays.\nIn addition, because the qualification process is both product specific and platform specific, our existing customers sometimes require us to re-qualify our products, or to qualify our new products, for use in new platforms or applications. For example, as our OEM customers transition from prior generation architectures to current generation\narchitectures, we must design and qualify new products for use by those customers. In the past, the process of design and qualification has taken up to nine months to complete, during which time our net sales to those customers declined significantly. After our products are qualified, it can take several months before the customer begins production and we begin to generate net sales from such customer.\nLikewise, when our memory and NAND flash component vendors discontinue production of components, it may be necessary for us to design and qualify new products for our customers. Such customers may require of us or we may decide to purchase an estimated quantity of discontinued memory components necessary to ensure a steady supply of existing products until products with new components can be qualified. Purchases of this nature may affect our liquidity. Additionally, our estimation of quantities required during the transition may be incorrect, which could adversely impact our results of operations through lost revenue opportunities or charges related to excess and obsolete inventory.\nWe must devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualify our products with prospective customers in anticipation of sales. Significant delays in the qualification process, such as those experienced with our HyperCloud \u00ae product, could result in an inability to keep up with rapid technology change or new, competitive technologies. If we delay or do not succeed in qualifying a product with an existing or prospective customer, we will not be able to sell that product to that customer, which may result in our holding excess and obsolete inventory and harm our operating results and business.\nSales to a limited number of customers represent a significant portion of our net sales and the loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any one of these customers could materially harm our business.\nSales to certain of our OEM customers have historically represented a substantial majority of our net sales. Approximately 20%, 14% and 19% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended December 27, 2014 were to three of our customers. Approximately 45% and 15% of our nets sales in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 were to two of our customers. The composition of major customers and their respective contributions to our net sales have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period as our OEMs progress through the life cycle of the products they produce and sell. We do not have long-term agreements with our OEM customers, or with any other customer. Any one of these customers could decide at any time to discontinue, decrease or delay their purchase of our products. In addition, the prices that these customers pay for our products could change at any time. The loss of any of our OEM customers, or a significant reduction in sales to any of them, could significantly reduce our net sales and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur ability to maintain or increase our net sales to our key customers depends on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include our customers\u2019 continued sales of servers and other computing systems that incorporate our memory subsystems and our customers\u2019 continued incorporation of our products into their systems. Because of these and other factors, net sales to these customers may not continue and the amount of such net sales may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. Because these customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales, the failure of any one of these customers to pay on a timely basis would negatively impact our cash flow. In addition, while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products, we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relations with our customers. As we describe in more detail elsewhere in this Report, we have experienced a significant decline in sales of NVvault\u2122 to our key customer, Dell, and we did not have any sales of NVvault\u2122 to Dell during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2014. This loss of sales to Dell has had a significant impact on our revenues and gross profit.\nA limited number of relatively large potential customers dominate the markets for our products.\nOur target markets are characterized by a limited number of large companies. Consolidation in one or more of our target markets may further increase this industry concentration. As a result, we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated among a limited number of large customers in the foreseeable future. We believe that our financial results will depend in significant part on our success in establishing and maintaining relationships with, and effecting substantial sales to, these potential customers. Even if we establish and successfully maintain these relationships, our financial results will be largely dependent on these customers\u2019 sales and business results.\nIf a standardized memory solution which addresses the demands of our customers is developed, our net sales and market share may decline.\nMany of our memory subsystems are specifically designed for our OEM customers\u2019 high performance systems. In a drive to reduce costs and assure supply of their memory module demand, our OEM customers may endeavor to design JEDEC standard DRAM modules into their new products. Although we also manufacture JEDEC modules, this trend could reduce the demand for our higher priced customized memory solutions which in turn would have a negative impact on our financial results. In addition, customers deploying custom memory solutions today may in the future choose to adopt a JEDEC standard, and the adoption of a JEDEC standard module instead of a previously custom module might allow new competitors to participate in a share of our customers\u2019 memory module business that previously belonged to us.\nIf our OEM customers were to adopt JEDEC standard modules, our future business may be limited to identifying the next generation of high performance memory demands of OEM customers and developing solutions that addresses such demands. Until fully implemented, this next generation of products may constitute a much smaller market, which may reduce our net sales and market share.\nWe may not be able to maintain our competitive position because of the intense competition in our targeted markets.\nWe participate in a highly competitive market, and we expect competition to intensify. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and name recognition, a larger base of customers and longer-standing relationships with customers and suppliers than we have. As a result, some of these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products and are better positioned than we are to influence customer acceptance of their products over our products. These competitors also may be able to respond better to new or emerging technologies or standards and may be able to deliver products with comparable or superior performance at a lower price. For these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors. We also expect to face competition from new and emerging companies that may enter our existing or future markets. These potential competitors may have similar or alternative products which may be less costly or provide additional features.\nIn addition to the competition we face from DRAM and logic suppliers such as SK Hynix, Samsung, Micron, Inphi and IDT, some of our OEM customers have their own internal design groups that may develop solutions that compete with ours. These design groups have some advantages over us, including direct access to their respective companies\u2019 technical information and technology roadmaps. Our OEM customers also have substantially greater resources, financial and otherwise, than we do, and may have lower cost structures than ours. As a result, they may be able to design and manufacture competitive products more efficiently or inexpensively. If any of these OEM customers are successful in competing against us, our sales could decline, our margins could be negatively impacted and we could lose market share, any or all of which could harm our business and results of operations. Further, some of our significant suppliers are also competitors, many of whom have the ability to manufacture competitive products at lower costs as a result of their higher levels of integration.\nWe also face competition from manufacturers of DIMMs operating on the memory channel that employ NAND flash either alone or in combination with DRAM. For example, manufacturers such as Micron, AgigA Tech, Smart Modular, Viking, and SK Hynix offer NVDIMM products that compete with our NVvault\u2122 NVDIMM. The ULLtraDIMM product manufactured by SanDisk also uses NAND flash on the memory channel and competes with NVDIMMs from Netlist and other manufacturers. NVDIMMs and the ULLtraDIMM will also compete with our future products that combine DRAM and NAND flash on the memory channel, such as our HyperVault\u2122 product.\nWe expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products, reduce their prices and introduce new or enhanced technologies that may offer greater performance and improved pricing. If we are unable to match or exceed the improvements made by our competitors, our market position would deteriorate and our net sales would decline. In addition, our competitors may develop future generations and enhancements of competitive products that may render our technologies obsolete or uncompetitive.\nIf we fail to protect our proprietary rights, our customers or our competitors might gain access to our proprietary designs, processes and technologies, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe rely on a combination of patent protection, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We have submitted a number of patent applications regarding our proprietary processes and technology. It is not certain when or if any of the claims in the remaining applications will be allowed. As of December 27, 2014, we had 54 U.S. and foreign patents issued and over 34 pending applications worldwide. We intend to continue filing patent applications with respect to most of the new processes and technologies that we develop. However, patent protection may not be available for some of these processes or technologies.\nIt is possible that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not:\n\u00b7\nprevent challenges to, or the invalidation or circumvention of, our existing intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nprevent our competitors from independently developing similar products, duplicating our products or designing around any patents that may be issued to us;\n\u00b7\nprevent disputes with third parties regarding ownership of our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nprevent disclosure of our trade secrets and know-how to third parties or into the public domain;\n\u00b7\nresult in valid patents, including international patents, from any of our pending or future applications; or\n\u00b7\notherwise adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nOthers may attempt to reverse engineer, copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technologies without our consent. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our technologies is difficult. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use of our technologies. This is particularly true in foreign countries, such as the PRC, where we have established a manufacturing facility and where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as applicable U.S. laws.\nIf some or all of the claims in our patent applications are not allowed, or if any of our intellectual property protections are limited in scope by the USPTO or our foreign patents being subjected to invalidation proceedings with their respective authorities, or by a court or circumvented by others, we could face increased competition with regard to our products and be unable to execute on our strategy of monetizing our intellectual property. Increased competition or an inability to monetize our intellectual property could significantly harm our business, our operating results and prospects. Currently five of our patents are the subject of inter partes reexamination proceedings with the USPTO, or appeals therefrom, and we cannot assure you that any of these proceedings will result in an outcome favorable to us.\nWe are involved in and expect to continue to be involved in costly legal and administrative proceedings to defend against claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others or to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights.\nAs is common to the semiconductor industry, we have experienced substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Lawsuits claiming that we are infringing others\u2019 intellectual property rights have been and may in the future be brought against us, and we are currently defending against claims of invalidity in the USPTO.\nThe process of obtaining and protecting patents is inherently uncertain. In addition to the patent issuance process established by law and the procedures of the USPTO, we must comply with JEDEC administrative procedures in protecting our intellectual property within its industry standard setting process. These procedures evolve over time, are subject to variability in their application, and may be inconsistent with each other. Failure to comply with JEDEC\u2019s administrative procedures could jeopardize our ability to claim that our patents have been infringed.\nBy making use of new technologies and entering new markets there is an increased likelihood that others might allege that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and an adverse outcome in existing or any future litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our proprietary rights. An adverse outcome also could force us to take specific actions, including causing us to:\n\u00b7\ncease manufacturing and/or selling products, or using certain processes, that are claimed to be infringing a third party\u2019s intellectual property;\n\u00b7\npay damages (which in some instances may be three times actual damages), including royalties on past or future sales;\n\u00b7\nseek a license from the third party intellectual property owner to use their technology in our products, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or\n\u00b7\nredesign those products that are claimed to be infringing a third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf any adverse ruling in any such matter occurs, any resulting limitations in our ability to market our products, or delays and costs associated with redesigning our products or payments of license fees to third parties, or any failure by us to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is a limited pool of experienced technical personnel that we can draw upon to meet our hiring needs. As a result, a number of our existing employees have worked for our existing or potential competitors at some point during their careers, and we anticipate that a number of our future employees will have similar work histories. In the past, some of these competitors have claimed that our employees misappropriated their trade secrets or violated non-competition or non-solicitation agreements. Some of our competitors may threaten or bring legal action involving similar claims against us or our existing employees or make such claims in the future to prevent us from hiring qualified candidates. Lawsuits of this type may be brought, even if there is no merit to the claim, simply as a strategy to drain our financial resources and divert management\u2019s attention away from our business.\nOur business strategy also includes litigating claims against others, including our competitors, customers and former employees, to enforce our intellectual property, contractual and commercial rights including, in particular, our trade secrets, as well as to challenge the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. We could become subject to counterclaims or countersuits against us as a result of this litigation. Moreover, any legal disputes with customers could cause them to cease buying or using our products or delay their purchase of our products and could substantially damage our relationship with them.\nAny litigation, regardless of its outcome, would be time consuming and costly to resolve, divert our management\u2019s time and attention and negatively impact our results of operations. We cannot assure you that current or future infringement claims by or against third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions or claims will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a result of the unfavorable outcome in connection with the litigation against Diablo Technologies, Inc., for controller chips used by SanDisk Corporation in its high-speed ULLtraDIMM SSD product line, we may expend significant resources to pursue an appeal in the case, which may not be resolved in a timely manner nor yield a more favorable outcome. Moreover, the expenses associated with the matter, including the bond that may now be subject to forfeiture, may materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may become involved in non-patent related litigation and administrative proceedings that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and\nother litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic and political uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address, including the cyclical nature of and volatility in the memory market and semiconductor industry.\nAdverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions have made it extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and they have caused and could continue to cause U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products and services, which would further delay and lengthen sales cycles. In addition, sales of our products are dependent upon demand in the computing, networking, communications, printer, storage and industrial markets. These markets have been cyclical and are characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. These markets have experienced significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles, reductions in technology spending and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and the erosion of average selling prices and may result in reduced willingness of potential licensees to enter into license agreement with us.\nWe may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to factors affecting the computing, networking, communications, printers, storage and industrial markets. A decline or significant shortfall in demand in any one of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products. As a result, our sales will likely decline during these periods. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, if we are unable to control our expenses adequately in response to reduced sales, our gross margins, operating income and cash flow would be negatively impacted.\nDuring challenging economic times our customers may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would be negatively impacted. Furthermore, our vendors may face similar issues gaining access to credit, which may limit their ability to supply components or provide trade credit to us. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, worldwide, or in the memory market and related semiconductor industry. If the economy or markets in which we operate do not continue to improve or if conditions worsen, our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the combination of our lengthy sales cycle coupled with challenging macroeconomic conditions could compound the negative impact on the results of our operations.\nOur lack of a significant backlog of unfilled orders, and the difficulty inherent in forecasting customer demand, makes it difficult to forecast our short-term production requirements to meet that demand, and any failure to optimally calibrate our production capacity and inventory levels to meet customer demand could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and earnings.\nWe make significant decisions regarding the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. We do not have long-term purchase agreements with our customers. Instead, our customers often place purchase orders no more than two weeks in advance of their desired delivery date, and these purchase orders generally have no cancellation or rescheduling penalty provisions. The short-term nature of commitments by many of our customers, the fact that our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders for any reason, and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for our customers\u2019 products each reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements for our products. This fact, combined with the quick turn-around times that apply to each order, makes it difficult to forecast our production needs and allocate production capacity efficiently. We attempt to forecast the demand for the DRAM ICs, NAND, and other components needed to manufacture our products. Lead times for components vary significantly and depend on various factors, such as the specific supplier and the demand and supply for a component at a given time.\nOur production expense and component purchase levels are based in part on our forecasts of our customers\u2019 future product requirements and to a large extent are fixed in the short term. As a result, we likely will be unable to adjust spending on a timely basis to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in those orders. If we overestimate customer demand, we may have excess raw material inventory of DRAM ICs and NAND. If there is a subsequent decline in the prices of DRAM ICs or NAND, the value of our inventory will fall. As a result, we may need to write-down the value of our DRAM IC or NAND inventory, which may result in a significant decrease in our gross margin and financial condition. Also, to the extent that we manufacture products in anticipation of future demand that does not materialize, or in the event a customer cancels or reduces outstanding orders, we could experience an unanticipated increase in our finished goods inventory. In the past, we have had to write-down inventory due to obsolescence, excess quantities and declines in market value below our costs. Any significant shortfall of customer orders in relation to our expectations could hurt our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nAlso, any rapid increases in production required by our customers could strain our resources and reduce our margins. If we underestimate customer demand, we may not have sufficient inventory of DRAM ICs and NAND on hand to manufacture enough product to meet that demand. We also may not have sufficient manufacturing capacity at any given time to meet our customers\u2019 demands for rapid increases in production. These shortages of inventory and capacity will lead to delays in the delivery of our products, and we could forego sales opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships.\nDeclines in our average sales prices, driven by volatile prices for DRAM ICs and NAND, among other factors, may result in declines in our revenues and gross profit.\nOur industry is competitive and historically has been characterized by declines in average sales price, based in part on the market price of DRAM ICs and NAND, which have historically constituted a substantial portion of the total cost of our memory subsystems. Our average sales prices may decline due to several factors, including overcapacity in the worldwide supply of DRAM and NAND memory components as a result of worldwide economic conditions, increased manufacturing efficiencies, implementation of new manufacturing processes and expansion of manufacturing capacity by component suppliers.\nOnce our prices with a customer are negotiated, we are generally unable to revise pricing with that customer until our next regularly scheduled price adjustment. Consequently, we are exposed to the risks associated with the volatility of the price of DRAM ICs and NAND during that period. If the market prices for DRAM ICs and NAND increase, we generally cannot pass the price increases on to our customers for products purchased under an existing purchase order. As a result, our cost of sales could increase and our gross margins could decrease. Alternatively, if there are declines in the price of DRAM ICs and NAND, we may need to reduce our selling prices for subsequent purchase orders, which may result in a decline in our expected net sales.\nIn addition, since a large percentage of our sales are to a small number of customers that are primarily distributors and large OEMs, these customers have exerted, and we expect they will continue to exert, pressure on us to make price concessions. If not offset by increases in volume of sales or the sales of newly-developed products with higher margins, decreases in average sales prices would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur production expense and component purchase levels are based in part on our forecasts of our customers\u2019 future product requirements and to a large extent are fixed in the short term. As a result, we likely will be unable to adjust spending on a timely basis to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in those orders. If we overestimate customer demand, we may have excess raw material inventory of DRAM ICs and NAND. If there is a subsequent decline in the prices of DRAM ICs or NAND, the value of our inventory will fall. As a result, we may need to write-down the value of our DRAM IC or NAND inventory, which may result in a significant decrease in our gross margin and financial condition. Also, to the extent that we manufacture products in anticipation of future demand that does not materialize, or in the event a customer cancels or reduces outstanding orders, we could experience an unanticipated increase in our finished goods inventory. In the past, we have had to write-down inventory due to obsolescence, excess\nquantities and declines in market value below our costs. Any significant shortfall of customer orders in relation to our expectations could hurt our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nAlso, any rapid increases in production required by our customers could strain our resources and reduce our margins. If we underestimate customer demand, we may not have sufficient inventory of DRAM ICs and NAND on hand to manufacture enough product to meet that demand. We also may not have sufficient manufacturing capacity at any given time to meet our customers\u2019 demands for rapid increases in production. These shortages of inventory and capacity will lead to delays in the delivery of our products, and we could forego sales opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships.\nIf the supply of other component materials used to manufacture our products is interrupted, or if our inventory becomes obsolete, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe use consumables and other components, including PCBs, to manufacture our memory subsystems. We sometimes procure PCBs and other components from single or limited sources to take advantage of volume pricing discounts. Material shortages or transportation problems could interrupt the manufacture of our products from time to time in the future. These delays in manufacturing could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFrequent technology changes and the introduction of next-generation products also may result in the obsolescence of other items of inventory, such as our custom-built PCBs, which could reduce our gross margin and adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition. We may not be able to sell some products developed for one customer to another customer because our products are often designed to address specific customer requirements, and even if we are able to sell these products to another customer, our margin on such products may be reduced.\nA prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain a manufacturing facility in the PRC for producing most of our products, which allows us to utilize our materials and processes, protect our intellectual property and develop the technology for manufacturing. A prolonged disruption or material malfunction of, interruption in or the loss of operations at our manufacturing facility, or the failure to maintain a sufficient labor force at such facility, could require us to rely on third parties for our manufacturing needs, which generally increases our manufacturing costs and decreases our profit margins, and could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. The replacement of the manufacturing facility could take an extended amount of time before manufacturing operations could restart. The potential delays and costs resulting from these steps could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In July 2014, our PRC facility suffered water damage as a result of heavy rain and floods, which forced us to temporarily halt manufacturing at our PRC facility while necessary repairs or replacements were made to our PRC facility and to certain of our manufacturing equipment. This incident caused us to incur additional expenses as we shifted our manufacturing activities to a third-party manufacturing facility in the PRC to enable us to mitigate the disruption in shipments to our customers. While we believe we have contained the disruptions we expect that our relationships with our key customers could be materially harmed if we incur additional manufacturing disruptions in the future. We are currently processing this incident as a claim with our insurer but there can be no assurance that we will recover our losses from our insurer. We are unable to provide assurances that similar events will not occur in the future or that we will be able to secure alternative manufacturing capabilities if manufacturing at our PRC facility is disrupted.\nIf we are unable to manufacture our products efficiently, our operating results could suffer.\nWe must continuously review and improve our manufacturing processes in an effort to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and product performance, to lower our costs and to otherwise remain competitive. As we manufacture more complex products, the risk of encountering delays or difficulties increases. The start-up costs associated with implementing new manufacturing technologies, methods and processes, including the purchase of new equipment, and any resulting manufacturing delays and inefficiencies, could negatively impact our results of operations.\nIf we need to add manufacturing capacity, an expansion of our existing manufacturing facility or establishment of a new facility could be subject to factory audits by our customers. Any delays or unexpected costs resulting from this audit process could adversely affect our net sales and results of operations. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to increase our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or meet the standards of any applicable factory audits.\nWe depend on third-parties to design and manufacture custom components for some of our products.\nSignificant customized components, such as ASICs, that are used in some of our products such as HyperCloud\u00ae are designed and manufactured by third parties. The ability and willingness of such third parties to perform in accordance with their agreements with us is largely outside of our control. If one or more of our design or manufacturing partners fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market or deliver products to our customers, as well as our reputation, could suffer. In the event of any such failures, we may have no readily available alternative source of supply for such products, since, in our experience, the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new design and/or manufacturing partner is at least 12 months, and the estimated time for our OEM customers to re-qualify our product with components from a new vendor ranges from four to nine months. We cannot assure you that we can redesign, or cause to have redesigned, our customized components to be manufactured by a new manufacturer in a timely manner, nor can we assure you that we will not infringe on the intellectual property of our current design or manufacture partner when we redesign the custom components, or cause such components to be redesigned by a new manufacturer. A manufacturing disruption experienced by our manufacturing partners, the failure of our manufacturing partners to dedicate adequate resources to the production of our products, the financial instability of our manufacturing or design partners, or any other failure of our design or manufacturing partners to perform according to their agreements with us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have many other risks due to our dependence on third-party manufacturers, including: reduced control over delivery schedules, quality, manufacturing yields and cost; the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand; limited warranties on products supplied to us; and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property. We are dependent on our manufacturing partners to manufacture products with acceptable quality and manufacturing yields, to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and to allocate a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs. Although our products are designed using the process design rules of the particular manufacturers, we cannot assure you that our manufacturing partners will be able to achieve or maintain acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of components on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our manufacturing partners will continue to devote adequate resources to produce our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the qualification and manufacturing of our products are based.\nIf our products do not meet the quality standards of our customers, we may be forced to stop shipments of products until the quality issues are resolved.\nOur customers require our products to meet strict quality standards. Should our products not meet such standards, our customers may discontinue purchases from us until we are able to resolve the quality issues that are causing us to not meet the standards. Such \u201cquality holds\u201d could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and operating results.\nIf our products are defective or are used in defective systems, we may be subject to warranty, product recalls or product liability claims.\nIf our products are defectively manufactured, contain defective components or are used in defective or malfunctioning systems, we could be subject to warranty and product liability claims and product recalls, safety alerts or advisory notices. While we have product liability insurance coverage, it may not be adequate to satisfy claims made against us. We also may be unable to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts.\nAlthough we generally attempt to contractually limit our exposure to incidental and consequential damages, if these contract provisions are not enforced or are unenforceable or if liabilities arise that are not effectively limited, we could incur substantial costs in defending or settling product liability claims.\nWarranty and product liability claims or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation, and on our ability to attract and retain customers. In addition, we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept product returns in circumstances where we are not contractually obligated to do so in order to maintain good relations with our customers. Accepting product returns may negatively impact our operating results.\nIf we are required to obtain licenses to use third party intellectual property and we fail to do so, our business could be harmed.\nAlthough some of the components used in our final products contain the intellectual property of third parties, we believe that our suppliers bear the sole responsibility to obtain any rights and licenses to such third party intellectual property. While we have no knowledge that any third party licensor disputes our belief, we cannot assure you that disputes will not arise in the future. The operation of our business and our ability to compete successfully depends significantly on our continued operation without claims of infringement or demands resulting from such claims, including demands for payments of money in the form of, for example, ongoing licensing fees.\nWe are also developing products to enter new markets. Similar to our current products, we may use components in these new products that contain the intellectual property of third parties. While we plan to exercise precautions to avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that disputes will not arise.\nIf it is determined that we are required to obtain inbound licenses and we fail to obtain licenses, or if such licenses are not available on economically feasible terms, our business, operating results and financial condition could be significantly harmed.\nThe flash memory market is constantly evolving and competitive, and we may not have rights to manufacture and sell certain types of products utilizing emerging flash formats, or we may be required to pay a royalty to sell products utilizing these formats.\nThe flash-based storage market is constantly undergoing rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. Many consumer devices, such as digital cameras, PDAs and smartphones, are transitioning to emerging flash memory formats, such as the Memory Stick, and xD Picture Card formats, which we do not currently manufacture and do not have rights to manufacture. Although we do not currently serve the consumer flash market, it is possible that certain OEMs may choose to adopt these higher-volume, lower-cost formats. This could result in a decline in demand, on a relative basis, for other products that we manufacture such as CompactFlash, SD and embedded USB drives. If we decide to manufacture flash memory products utilizing emerging formats such as those mentioned, we will be required to secure licenses to give us the right to manufacture such products that may not be available at reasonable rates or at all. If we are not able to supply flash card formats at competitive prices or if we were to have product shortages, our net sales could be adversely impacted and our customers would likely cancel orders or seek other suppliers to replace us.\nOur indemnification obligations for the infringement by our products of the intellectual property rights of others could require us to pay substantial damages.\nAs is common in the industry, we currently have in effect a number of agreements in which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers and suppliers from damages and costs which may arise from the infringement by our products of third-party patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights. The scope of such indemnity varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees. Our insurance does not cover intellectual property infringement. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. We may periodically have to respond to claims and litigate these types of indemnification obligations. Although our suppliers may bear responsibility for the intellectual\nproperty inherent in the components they sell to us, they may lack the financial ability to stand behind such indemnities. Additionally, it may be costly to enforce any indemnifications that they have granted to us. Accordingly, any indemnification claims by customers could require us to incur significant legal fees and could potentially result in the payment of substantial damages, both of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on a few key employees, and if we lose the services of any of those employees or are unable to hire additional personnel, our business could be harmed.\nTo date, we have been highly dependent on the experience, relationships and technical knowledge of certain key employees. We believe that our future success will be dependent on our ability to retain the services of these key employees, develop their successors, reduce our reliance on them, and properly manage the transition of their roles should departures occur. The loss of these key employees could delay the development and introduction of, and negatively impact our ability to sell, our products and otherwise harm our business. We do not have employment agreements with any of these key employees other than Chun K. Hong, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. We maintain \u201cKey Man\u201d life insurance on Chun K. Hong; however, we do not carry \u201cKey Man\u201d life insurance on any of our other key employees.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled engineering, manufacturing, and other technical and sales personnel. Competition for experienced personnel is intense. We may not be successful in attracting new engineers or other technical personnel, or in retaining or motivating our existing personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain engineers with the skills necessary to keep pace with the evolving technologies in our markets, our ability to continue to provide our current products and to develop new or enhanced products will be negatively impacted, which would harm our business. In addition, the shortage of experienced engineers, and other factors, may lead to increased recruiting, relocation and compensation costs for such engineers, which may exceed our expectations and resources. These increased costs may make hiring new engineers difficult, or may increase our operating expenses.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our workforce has consisted of contract personnel. We invest considerable time and expense in training these contract employees. We may experience high turnover rates in our contract employee workforce, which may require us to expend additional resources in the future. If we convert any of these contract employees into permanent employees, we may have to pay finder\u2019s fees to the contract agency.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers\u2019 representatives and the failure of these manufacturers\u2019 representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales.\nWe sell some of our products to customers through manufacturers\u2019 representatives. We are unable to predict the extent to which our manufacturers\u2019 representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products. Moreover, many of our manufacturers\u2019 representatives also market and sell other, potentially competing products. Our representatives may terminate their relationships with us at any time. Our future performance will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract additional manufacturers\u2019 representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products. If we cannot retain our current manufacturers\u2019 representatives or recruit additional or replacement manufacturers\u2019 representatives, our sales and operating results will be harmed.\nThe operation of our manufacturing facility in the PRC could expose us to significant risks.\nSince 2009, most of our world-wide manufacturing production has been performed at our manufacturing facility in the PRC. Language and cultural differences, as well as the geographic distance from our headquarters in Irvine, California, further compound the difficulties of running a manufacturing operation in the PRC. Our management has limited experience in creating or overseeing foreign operations, and the ongoing management of our PRC facility may require our management team to divert substantial amounts of their time, particularly if we encounter operational difficulties or manufacturing disruptions at our PRC facility. We may not be able to maintain control over product\nquality, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Furthermore, the costs related to having excess capacity have in the past and may in the future continue to have an adverse impact on our gross margins and operating results.\nWe manage a local workforce that may subject us to regulatory uncertainties. Changes in the labor laws of the PRC could increase the cost of employing the local workforce. The increased industrialization of the PRC, as well as general economic and political conditions in the PRC, could also increase the price of local labor. Any or all combination of these factors could negatively impact the cost savings we currently enjoy from having our manufacturing facility in the PRC.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our net sales.\nPart of our growth strategy involves making sales to foreign corporations and delivering our products to facilities located in foreign countries. To facilitate this process and to meet the long-term projected demand for our products, we have set up a manufacturing facility in the PRC. Selling and manufacturing in foreign countries subjects us to additional risks not present with our domestic operations. We are operating in business and regulatory environments in which we have limited previous experience. We will need to continue to overcome language and cultural barriers to effectively conduct our operations in these environments. In addition, the economies of the PRC and other countries have been highly volatile in the past, resulting in significant fluctuations in local currencies and other instabilities. These instabilities affect a number of our customers and suppliers in addition to our foreign operations and continue to exist or may occur again in the future.\nIn the future, some of our net sales may be denominated in Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d). The Chinese government controls the procedures by which RMB is converted into other currencies, and conversion of RMB generally requires government consent. As a result, RMB may not be freely convertible into other currencies at all times. If the Chinese government institutes changes in currency conversion procedures, or imposes restrictions on currency conversion, those actions may negatively impact our operations and could reduce our operating results. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rate between RMB and U.S. dollars may adversely affect our expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. These fluctuations may also adversely affect the comparability of our period-to-period results. If we decide to declare dividends and repatriate funds from our Chinese operations, we will be required to comply with the procedures and regulations of applicable Chinese law. Any changes to these procedures and regulations, or our failure to comply with those procedures and regulations, could prevent us from making dividends and repatriating funds from our Chinese operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition. If we are able to make dividends and repatriate funds from our Chinese operations, these dividends would be subject to U.S. corporate income tax.\nInternational turmoil and the threat of future terrorist attacks, both domestically and internationally, have contributed to an uncertain political and economic climate, both in the U.S. and globally, and have negatively impacted the worldwide economy. The occurrence of one or more of these instabilities could adversely affect our foreign operations and some of our customers or suppliers, each of which could adversely affect our net sales. In addition, our failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements or overcome cultural barriers could result in production delays and increased turn-around times, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur international sales are subject to other risks, including regulatory risks, tariffs and other trade barriers, timing and availability of export licenses, political and economic instability, difficulties in accounts receivable collections, difficulties in managing distributors, lack of a significant local sales presence, difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals, compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties and potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, the U.S. or foreign countries may implement quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products, leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country.\nOur operations could be disrupted by power outages, natural disasters or other factors.\nDue to the geographic concentration of our manufacturing operations in our PRC facility, and the operations of certain of our suppliers, a disruption resulting from equipment failure, power failures, quality control issues, human error, government intervention or natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods like those that have struck Japan and Thailand, respectively, could interrupt or interfere with our manufacturing operations and consequently harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such disruptions would cause significant delays in shipments of our products and adversely affect our operating results. In July 2014, our PRC facility suffered water damage as a result of heavy rain and floods, which forced us to temporarily halt manufacturing at our PRC facility while necessary repairs or replacements were made to our PRC facility and to certain of our manufacturing equipment. This incident caused us to incur additional expenses as we shifted our manufacturing activities to a third-party manufacturing facility in the PRC to enable us to mitigate the disruption in shipments to our customers. While we believe we have contained the disruptions we expect that our relationships with our key customers could be materially harmed if we incur additional manufacturing disruptions in the future. We are currently processing this incident as a claim with our insurer. We are unable to provide assurances that similar events will not occur in the future or that we will be able to secure alternative manufacturing capabilities if manufacturing at our PRC facility is disrupted.\nDifficulties with our global information technology systems, and/or unauthorized access to such systems, could harm our business.\nAny failure or malfunctioning of our global information technology system, errors or misuse by system users, difficulties in migrating standalone systems to our centralized systems, or inadequacy of the system in addressing the needs of our operations, could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such failure, errors, misuse or inadequacy could also disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process, report and evaluate key operations metrics and key components of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any such disruptions would likely divert our management and key employees\u2019 attention away from other business matters. Any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our global information technology system could also adversely affect our ability to complete important business process, such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn connection with our daily business transactions, we store data about our business, including certain customer data, on our global information technology systems. While our systems are designed with security measures to prevent unauthorized access, third parties may gain unauthorized access to our systems. This unauthorized access could take the form of intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, employee malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information, in order to gain access to our information technology system for the purpose of sabotage, or to access our data, including our and our customers\u2019 intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems evolve frequently and generally are not recognized until successful, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in disruption to our business, misappropriation or loss of data, loss of confidence in us by our customers, damage to our reputation, legal liability and a negative impact on our sales.\nOur failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liabilities or cause us to incur significant costs.\nWe are subject to various and frequently changing U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. In particular, some of our manufacturing processes may require us to handle and dispose of hazardous materials from time to time. For example, in the past our manufacturing operations have used lead-based solder in the assembly of our products. Today, we use lead-free soldering technologies in our manufacturing processes, as this is required for products entering the European Union. We could incur substantial costs, including\nclean-up costs, civil or criminal fines or sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of, or noncompliance with, environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations also could require us to incur significant costs to remain in compliance.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nIn August 2012, the SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals, known as conflict materials, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The rule requires companies to verify and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. To comply with this rule, we are required to conduct a reasonable country of origin each year and, depending on the results of that inquiry, we may be required to exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals contained in our products. Such due diligence must conform to a nationally or internationally recognized due diligence framework. We are required to file a disclosure report with the SEC in May of each year relating to the preceding calendar year. In addition, commencing with the disclosure report relating to the 2015 calendar year, to the extent that we are required to exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals, we will be required to obtain an independent private sector audit of our disclosure report and underlying due diligence measures.\nThe due diligence activities required to determine the source and chain of custody of minerals contained in our products are time consuming and may result in significant costs. Due to the size and complexity of our supply chain, we face significant challenges in verifying the origins of the minerals used in our products. Further, this rule could affect the availability in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. There may be only limited number of sources of \u201cconflict-free\u201d minerals, which could result in increased material and component costs, as well as additional costs associated with potential changes to our products, processes or sources of supply.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the minerals used in our products through the due diligence measures that we implement, or if we are unable to obtain an audit report each year that concludes that our due diligence measures are in conformity with the criteria set forth in the relevant due diligence framework. Our reputation could be harmed. In addition, we may not be able to satisfy customers who require that our products be certified as \u201cconflict-free\u201d which could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, which we collectively refer to as Section 404, require us to evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on those internal controls as of the end of each year. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. In the course of our Section 404 evaluations, we may identify conditions that may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses and we may conclude that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable. Implementing any such matters would divert the attention of our management, could involve significant costs, and may negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe note that there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, as they cannot prevent collusion, management override or failure of human judgment. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, and it could harm our financial condition and results of operations, result in a loss of investor confidence and negatively impact our stock price.\nIf we do not effectively manage future growth, our resources, systems and controls may be strained and our results of operations may suffer.\nAny future growth may strain our resources, management information and telecommunication systems, and operational and financial controls. To manage future growth effectively, including any expansion of volume in our manufacturing facility in the PRC, we must be able to improve and expand our systems and controls. We may not be able to do this in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our current systems and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. In addition, our officers have relatively limited experience in managing a rapidly growing business. As a result, they may not be able to provide the guidance necessary to manage future growth or maintain future market position. Any failure to manage our growth or improve or expand our existing systems and controls, or unexpected difficulties in doing so, could harm our business.\nWe may be unsuccessful in establishing and operating an intellectual property based business.\nWe do not at this time have an intellectual property (IP)-based licensing business and may never succeed in developing such a business. As we are currently in a products-based business model, we may be unsuccessful in developing an IP-based licensing business. The establishment of this new business may be more difficult or costly than expected and require additional personnel, investments and may be a significant distraction for management. In connection with our IP-based licensing business, our licenses and royalties revenue may be uncertain from period to period, and we may be unable to attract new licensing customers which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to increase our license revenue will depend on a variety of factors, including the performance, quality, breadth and depth of our current and future IP, as well as our sales and marketing capabilities. Once secured, license revenue may be negatively affected by factors within and outside our control, including reductions in our customers\u2019 sales prices, sales volumes and the terms of such licenses.\nIf we acquire other businesses or technologies in the future, these acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe will evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or technologies that might complement our current product offerings or enhance our technical capabilities. We have no experience in acquiring other businesses or technologies. Acquisitions entail a number of risks that could adversely affect our business and operating results, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies or products of the acquired companies;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from the normal daily operations of the business;\n\u00b7\ninsufficient increases in net sales to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions or acquired companies;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired companies;\n\u00b7\nthe overestimation of potential synergies or a delay in realizing those synergies;\n\u00b7\nentering markets in which we have no or limited experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions; and\n\u00b7\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.\nFuture acquisitions also could cause us to incur debt or be subject to contingent liabilities. In addition, acquisitions could cause us to issue equity securities that could dilute the ownership percentages of our existing stockholders. Furthermore, acquisitions may result in material charges or adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, deferred compensation charges, in-process research and development charges, the amortization of amounts\nrelated to deferred stock-based compensation expense and identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill, any or all of which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders.\nAs of February 28, 2015, approximately 12.6% of our outstanding common stock was held by affiliates, including 11.3% held by Chun K. Hong, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors. As a result, Mr. Hong has the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of control could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with interests different from those of Mr. Hong.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control and could also limit the market price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. In addition, these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. The following are examples of provisions which are included in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended:\n\u00b7\nour board of directors is authorized, without prior stockholder approval, to designate and issue preferred stock, commonly referred to as \"blank check\" preferred stock, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nstockholder action by written consent is prohibited;\n\u00b7\nnominations for election to our board of directors and the submission of matters to be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting are subject to advance notice requirements; and\n\u00b7\nour board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest or other change of control transaction involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could prevent the consummation of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then-current market price for their shares.\nThe price of and volume in trading of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock has been publicly traded since November 2006. The price of our common stock and the trading volume of our shares are volatile and have in the past fluctuated significantly. There can be no assurance as to the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future or that an active trading market in our common stock will be sustained in the future. The market price at which our common stock trades may be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nour operating and financial performance and prospects, including our ability to achieve and sustain profitability in the future;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and level of research coverage of and market making in our common stock;\n\u00b7\nresults of litigation;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;\n\u00b7\nsales of our newly issued common stock or other securities associated with our shelf registration statement declared effective by the SEC on October 18, 2011 and our new registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-199446) which we have filed but which has not yet been declared effective by the SEC, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u00b7\ngeneral financial and other market conditions; and\n\u00b7\nchanging and recently volatile domestic and international economic conditions.\nIn addition, shares of our common stock and the public stock markets in general have experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme price and trading volume volatility. These fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and a stockholder's ability to sell their shares into the market at the desired time or at the desired price.\nIn 2007, following a drop in the market price of our common stock, securities litigation was initiated against us. Given the historic volatility of our industry, we may become engaged in this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation is expensive and time-consuming.", "PERMNO": 91616, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "NLST"}
