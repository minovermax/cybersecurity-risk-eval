{"cik": "1135185", "company": "ATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following Risk Factors and all other information in this Report. These Risk Factors are not the only ones facing us. Our operations could also be impaired by additional risks and uncertainties. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nRisks Related to Our Business Generally\nDeterioration or disruption in the airfreight market, global economic conditions, financial markets or global supply chains, including the impact of geopolitical events, severe weather, natural disasters or health epidemics, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to access capital markets.\nAirfreight demand has historically been highly dependent on global economic conditions, which could be negatively impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government trade policies, changes in economies throughout the world and limited access to certain markets, among other things. If demand for our services, Yields or lease rates deteriorate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also could be negatively impacted by disruptions caused by geopolitical events, severe weather, natural disasters or health epidemics. In December 2019, COVID-19 was first reported in China and has since spread throughout the world. In March 2020, it was determined to be a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The subsequent emergence of several variants of COVID-19 has compounded these disruptions. The ongoing public health crisis has disrupted global manufacturing, supply chains, passenger travel and consumer spending, resulting in flight cancellations of certain cargo and passenger flights. We have incurred and expect to incur significant additional costs, including premium pay for employees operating in certain areas significantly impacted by COVID-19, and other operational costs, including costs for continuing to provide a safe working environment for our employees. The availability of hotels and restaurants, evolving COVID-19-related travel restrictions and health screenings; and reductions in passenger flights by other airlines globally could further impact our ability to position employees to operate our aircraft. In addition, COVID-19-related airport closures, employees who are unable to work, vaccine mandates or disruption of operations by our third-party service providers could impact our contractual service requirements for customers resulting in financial penalties. Although we have implemented various initiatives to mitigate disruptions, given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the duration of business disruption and the extent of customer cancellations, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. If we are unable to implement existing or additional initiatives to mitigate disruptions, it could materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets deteriorate. Our business is capital intensive and growth depends on the availability of capital for new aircraft, among other things. If capital availability deteriorates, we may be unable to raise the capital necessary to finance business growth or other initiatives or to repay our debt when it matures. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.\nWe could be adversely affected if any of our existing aircraft are underutilized, if we fail to deploy or redeploy aircraft with customers at favorable rates, or if any of our aircraft are impaired. We could also be adversely affected from the loss of one or more of our aircraft for an extended period of time.\nOur operating revenues depend on our ability to effectively deploy the aircraft in our fleet and maintain high utilization of our aircraft at favorable rates. We typically enter into long-term ACMI and Charter contracts with our customers for our aircraft. The terms of our existing contracts are generally scheduled to expire on a staggered basis. There is a risk that any of our ACMI or Charter customers may not renew their contracts with us on favorable terms or at all, perhaps due to reasons beyond our control. Also, certain customers have the opportunity to terminate their long-term agreements in advance of the expiration date, following notice to allow for remarketing of the\naircraft. Entering into ACMI and Charter contracts with new customers sometimes requires a long sales cycle, and as a result, if our contracts are not renewed, and there is a resulting delay in entering into new contracts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we have unutilized aircraft, we may seek to redeploy those aircraft in our Dry Leasing business or sell them. If we are unable to successfully redeploy our existing aircraft at favorable rates or sell them on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if one or more of our aircraft is out of service for an extended period of time, our operating revenues would decrease, and we may have difficulty fulfilling our obligations under one or more of our existing contracts. The loss of revenue resulting from any such business interruption, and the cost and potentially long lead time and difficulties in sourcing a replacement aircraft, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe record impairment charges on long-lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. The airfreight market and Yields can be volatile and negatively affected by excess capacity due to factors such as global economic conditions and reduced customer demand. Asset impairments or other charges related to capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal trade flows are typically seasonal, and our business, including our customers\u2019 business, experiences seasonal variations.\nGlobal trade flows are typically seasonal in nature, with peak activity occurring during the retail holiday season, which generally begins in September/October and lasts through most of December. Our ACMI, CMI and long-term Charter contracts generally have contractual utilization minimums that typically allow our customers to cancel an agreed-upon percentage of the guaranteed hours of aircraft utilization or a certain number of flight rotations over the course of a year. Our customers have historically exercised those allowable cancellation options early in the first quarter of the year, when the demand for air cargo capacity is historically low following the seasonal holiday peak in the fourth quarter of the previous year. While our revenues typically fluctuate seasonally as described above, a significant proportion of the costs associated with our business, such as debt service, aircraft rent, depreciation and facilities costs, are fixed and cannot easily be reduced to match the seasonal drop in demand. In addition, we typically incur a higher proportion of Heavy Maintenance during the first half of the year. As a result, our net operating results are typically lower in the first quarter and increase as the year progresses.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, including pilots, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain or expand our business operations.\nThe FAA requires that all airline pilots, including new hires, must have a minimum of 1,500 hours of operational experience. This requirement and other factors, including retirements and reductions in the number of military pilots being trained by the U.S. armed forces, have led to increased demand for pilots.\nIn addition, competition for all qualified personnel is increasingly intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in hiring, training, and retaining such personnel in the future. The extent and duration of the impact of labor market challenges are subject to numerous factors, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, availability of qualified personnel and competition from other service providers within the markets we serve.\nIf we are unable to hire, train and retain qualified pilots and other personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain or expand our business operations or result in increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected by a significant data breach or disruption of our information technology systems.\nWe are heavily and increasingly dependent on technology to operate our business. Our information technology systems or those of third parties on which we rely, as well as our business more broadly, could be disrupted due to various events, some of which are beyond our control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipment failures, software failures, computer viruses, security breaches and cyber attacks. In addition, there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance and human or technological error. A significant disruption could result in a range of potentially material negative consequences for us, including unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of company systems or data; theft of sensitive, regulated or confidential data, intellectual property; the loss of functionality of critical systems through ransomware, denial of service or other attacks; and business delays, service or system disruptions, damage to equipment and injury to persons or property.\nWe have taken numerous steps to implement business resiliency and cybersecurity and have obtained cyber business interruption insurance to help reduce the risk and impact of some of the potential disruptions discussed above. There can be no assurance, however, that the measures we have taken are adequate to prevent or remedy disruptions or failures of our systems.\nA cybersecurity incident could also impact our brand, harm our reputation and adversely impact our relationships with our customers, employees and stockholders. In addition, a failure of certain of our vital systems could limit our ability to operate our flights for an extended period of time. Failure to appropriately address these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInsurance coverage may become more expensive and difficult to obtain and may not be adequate to insure all of our risks. In addition, if our Dry Lease customers have inadequate insurance coverage or fail to fulfill their indemnification obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAviation and other insurance premiums historically have fluctuated based on factors that include the loss history of the industry in general, and the insured carrier in particular. Adverse events involving aircraft could result in increased insurance costs and could affect the price and availability of such coverage.\nWe participate in an insurance pooling arrangement with DHL and its partners. This allows us to obtain aviation hull and liability, war-risk hull and cargo loss, crew, third-party liability and hull deductible coverage at reduced rates from the commercial insurance providers. If we are no longer included in this arrangement for any reason or if pool members have coverage incidents, we may incur higher insurance costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing coverage on terms favorable to us or that the premiums for such coverage will not increase substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our aircraft are deployed in potentially dangerous locations and carry hazardous cargo incidental to the services we provide in support of our customers\u2019 activities. In addition, some areas through which our flight routes pass are subject to geopolitical instability, which increases the risk of death or injury to our passengers, employees or contractors, business interruption or a loss of, or damage to, our aircraft or its cargo. While we carry insurance against the risks inherent to our operations, which we believe are consistent with the insurance arrangements of other participants in our industry, we cannot provide assurance that we are adequately insured against all risks, including coverage for weapons of mass destruction. We do not have insurance against the loss arising from business interruption. Any injury to passengers, employees or contractors or loss/damage of aircraft/cargo incidents resulting in claims in excess of related insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLessees are required under our Dry Leases to indemnify us for, and insure against, liabilities arising out of the use and operation of the aircraft, including third-party claims for death or injury to persons and damage to property for which we may be deemed liable. Lessees are also required to maintain public liability, property damage and all-\nrisk hull and war-risk hull insurance on the aircraft at agreed-upon levels. If our lessees\u2019 insurance is not sufficient to cover all types of claims that may be asserted against us or if our lessees fail to fulfill their indemnification obligations, we would be required to pay any amounts in excess of our insurance coverage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are party to a collective bargaining agreement covering our pilots and a collective bargaining agreement covering our Atlas and Polar flight dispatchers, which could result in higher labor costs than those faced by some of our non-unionized competitors. This could also result in a work interruption or stoppage.\nPilots of Atlas (who operate Atlas and Polar flights) and flight dispatchers of Atlas and Polar are represented by the IBT. We had a five-year CBA with our Atlas pilots, which became amendable in September 2016 and a four-year CBA with our Southern Air, Inc. pilots, which became amendable in November 2016.\nWe have achieved a new five-year CBA with our pilots. This long-term CBA was reached through a binding arbitration process, with the arbitrator\u2019s decision being issued on September 10, 2021. The new pay rates became effective as of September 1, 2021, and we\u2019re working closely together with the union\u2019s new leadership on the implementation of other provisions of the agreement. Under this industry competitive agreement, all of our pilots will receive significantly higher pay, quality of life improvements and enhanced benefits. There are a few remaining open items from the arbitration decision that the parties are working together to resolve. See Note 14 to our Financial Statements for further discussion of our labor matters.\nWe have a five-year CBA with our Atlas and Polar dispatchers, which was extended in April 2017 for an additional four years, making the CBA amendable in November 2021. On September 15, 2021, the IBT, representing the flight dispatchers of Atlas and Polar, provided the Company with the requisite notice of its intent to commence negotiations for a new CBA pursuant to Section 6 of the Railway Labor Act. The Company and the IBT commenced bargaining with good faith discussions and are making progress towards an amended CBA.\nWe are subject to risks of increased labor costs associated with having a partially unionized workforce, as well as a greater risk of work interruption or stoppage, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including a reduction in our revenue and an increase in our operating costs. We cannot provide assurance that disputes, including disputes with certified collective bargaining representatives of our employees, will not arise in the future or will result in an agreement on terms satisfactory to us.\nIn addition, the costs associated with resolving such disputes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and any disruption in our business could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers.\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement and other rules and regulations that affect our business. A violation of these rules and regulations could lead to termination or suspension of our government contracts and could prevent us from entering into contracts with government agencies in the future.\nTo do business with government agencies, including the AMC, we must comply with, and are affected by, many rules and regulations, including those related to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. These rules and regulations, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire, in some cases, procurement from small businesses;\n\u2022\nrequire disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n\u2022\ngive rise to U.S. government audit rights;\n\u2022\nimpose accounting rules that dictate how we define certain accounts, define allowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts;\n\u2022\nestablish specific health, safety and doing-business standards; and\n\u2022\nrestrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.\nThese rules and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, add costs to our business. A violation of these rules and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts. In addition, the violation of certain other generally applicable rules and regulations could result in our suspension or debarment as a government contractor.\nOur financial condition may suffer if we experience unanticipated costs as a result of ongoing lawsuits and claims related to alleged pricing practices or other legal and regulatory matters.\nIn the Netherlands, Stichting Cartel Compensation, successor in interest to claims of various shippers, has filed suit in the district court in Amsterdam against British Airways, KLM, Martinair, Air France, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines seeking recovery for damages purportedly arising from allegedly unlawful pricing practices of such defendants. In response, British Airways, KLM, Martinair, Air France and Lufthansa filed third-party indemnification lawsuits against Polar Air Cargo, LLC (\u201cOld Polar\u201d), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, and Polar, seeking indemnification in the event the defendants are found to be liable in the main proceedings. Another defendant, Thai Airways, filed a similar indemnification claim. Activities in the case have focused on various procedural issues and rulings, some of which are awaiting court decisions on appeal. The ultimate outcome of the lawsuit is likely to be affected by a decision readopted by the European Commission in March 2017, finding EU competition law violations by British Airways, KLM, Martinair, Air France and Lufthansa, among others, but not Old Polar or Polar.\nIf Old Polar, Polar or the Company were to incur an unfavorable outcome in the litigation described above or in similar litigation, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to the litigation described above, we are subject to a number of Brazilian customs claims, as well as other claims, lawsuits and pending actions which we consider to be routine and incidental to our business (see Note 14 to our Financial Statements). If we were to receive an adverse ruling or decision on any such claims, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuel availability and price volatility could adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe price of aircraft fuel is unpredictable and can be volatile. Our exposure to fluctuations in fuel price is limited to the shorter-term commercial portion of our Charter services only, as fuel risk is largely mitigated by price adjustments, including those based on indexed fuel prices for longer-term commercial charter contracts. We do not incur fuel expense in providing ACMI and CMI services or in our Dry Leasing business as the cost of fuel is borne by customers. Similarly, we generally have no fuel price risk for AMC charters because the price is set under our contract with the AMC, and we receive or make payments to adjust for fuel price increases and decreases from the contractual rate. Regardless, if fuel costs increase significantly, our customers may reduce the volume and frequency of cargo shipments or find less costly alternatives for cargo delivery, such as land and sea carriers. Such actions by customers or fuel price volatility for our short-term charters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the past, we have not experienced significant difficulties with respect to fuel availability. Although we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in the availability of aircraft fuel, a number of factors, such as geopolitical uncertainties in oil-producing nations and shortages of and disruptions to refining capacity, make accurate predictions unreliable. Any inability to obtain aircraft fuel at competitive prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to provide certain essential services. If these service providers do not deliver the high level of service and support required in our business at commercially reasonable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to provide certain essential services on our behalf, including maintenance, ground handling and flight attendants. In certain locations, there may be very few sources, or sometimes only a single source, of supply for these services. If we are unable to effectively manage these third parties, they may provide inadequate levels of support or charge commercially unreasonable amounts for their services, which could harm our customer relationships and ability to remain competitive. Any material problems with the quality, timeliness and cost of our contracted services, or an unexpected termination of those services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have contractual obligations, including progress payments, associated with our aircraft orders. If we are unable to make the remaining required payments or obtain financing for these aircraft, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn January and December 2021, we placed orders with Boeing for four new 747-8F aircraft and four new 777-200LRF aircraft, respectively. We have paid the required pre-delivery payments for the 747-8F aircraft and are required to pay pre-delivery deposits to Boeing for the 777-200LRF aircraft in 2022. We expect to finance the 747-8F and 777-200LRF aircraft delivery payments through secured debt financing. If we are unable to make the remaining required progress payments to Boeing or secure financing on acceptable terms, we may incur financing costs that are substantially higher than what we currently anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur agreements with the U.S. Treasury under a payroll support program contain certain requirements and restrictions. If we are unable to comply with these requirements and restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with agreements entered into with the U.S. Treasury (the \u201cPSP Agreement\u201d), with respect to payroll support funding (the \u201cPayroll Support Program\u201d) available to cargo air carriers under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), we are required to comply with the relevant requirements of the CARES Act. These requirements include that funds provided pursuant to the PSP Agreement were to be used exclusively for the payment of certain employee wages, salaries and benefits of Atlas (the \u201cPSP Recipients\u201d). The Payroll Support Program subjects the PSP Recipients and certain of their affiliates to a number of restrictions, including certain limitations on executive compensation through March 24, 2022 and prohibitions of repurchasing shares in the open market of, or making dividend payments with respect to, our common stock that expired on September 30, 2021. Under the PSP Agreement, we must also maintain certain internal controls and records relating to the payroll support funding and we are subject to additional reporting obligations. If we do not comply with the requirements and restrictions within the Payroll Support Program, the U.S. Treasury could require repayment of amounts previously provided to us, among other actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. income tax purposes may be limited. In addition, we operate in multiple jurisdictions and may become subject to a wide range of income and other taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for U.S. income tax purposes, net of unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowance, most of which will expire through 2037, if not utilized. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d) imposes an annual limitation on the amount of a corporation\u2019s U.S. federal taxable income that can be offset by NOLs if it experiences an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined by Section 382. We experienced ownership changes as defined by Section 382 and, accordingly, the use of our NOLs generated prior to these ownership changes is subject to an annual limitation. If certain changes in our ownership occur prospectively, there could be additional annual limitations on the amount of utilizable NOLs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions and may become subject to a wide range of income and other taxes. If our operations become subject to significant income and other taxes, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, certain of our companies participate in an aircraft leasing incentive program in Singapore and qualify for a related concessionary income tax rate. If these companies do not remain in the program or the related concessionary rate increases in the future, we could be subject to additional Singapore income tax, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Airline Operations Business\nOur agreements with several customers require us to meet certain performance targets, including certain departure/arrival reliability standards. Failure to meet these performance targets could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur ability to derive the expected economic benefits from our transactions with certain customers depends substantially on our ability to successfully meet strict performance standards and deadlines for aircraft and ground operations. If we do not meet these requirements, we may not be able to achieve the projected revenues and profitability from these contracts, and we could be exposed to certain remedies, including termination of the agreements with Amazon and the BSA with DHL in the most extreme of circumstances, as described below.\nOur agreements with Amazon confer certain termination rights which, if exercised or triggered, may result in our inability to realize the full benefits of the agreements.\nThe agreements give Amazon the option to terminate in certain circumstances and upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including a change of control or our failure to meet certain performance requirements. In particular, Amazon will have the right to terminate without cause the agreement providing for CMI operations upon providing us at least 180 days\u2019 prior written notice of termination.\nUpon termination, Amazon will generally, subject to certain exceptions, retain the warrants that have vested prior to the time of termination and, depending on the circumstances giving rise to the termination, may have the right to accelerated vesting of the remaining warrants upon a change of control of our company. Upon termination, Amazon or we may also have the right to receive a termination fee from the other party depending on the circumstances giving rise to the right of termination.\nIf Amazon exercises any of these termination rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future earnings per share could be adversely impacted by the warrants granted to Amazon and, if Amazon exercises its right to acquire additional shares of common stock pursuant to the warrants, it will dilute the ownership interests and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe warrants granted to Amazon increase the number of diluted shares reported, which has a negative effect on our fully diluted earnings per share. If Amazon exercises its right to acquire additional shares of our common stock pursuant to the warrants, it will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders. In addition, any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants by Amazon could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nIf Amazon exercises its right to acquire additional shares of our common stock pursuant to the warrants, Amazon may become a significant stockholder and may be entitled to appoint a director to our board of directors.\nThe warrants issued by us to Amazon granted Amazon the right to purchase, in the aggregate, up to 39.9%, as of the date of the agreements, of our common stock on a post-issuance basis. If the warrants granted to Amazon are exercised, Amazon may become a significant stockholder of our company. We have entered into a stockholders agreement with Amazon, pursuant to which Amazon\u2019s ability to vote in its discretion will generally be capped at 14.9% with the remainder to be voted in accordance with our board of directors\u2019 recommendation. In addition, under the stockholders agreement, Amazon will be entitled to appoint one director to our board of directors when\nAmazon owns 10% or more of our common stock. Until such time, Amazon is entitled to designate a non-voting observer to our board of directors.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from the AMC, and a substantial portion of these revenues have been generated pursuant to expansion flying, as opposed to fixed contract arrangements with the AMC. Revenues from the AMC may decline over time.\nAs a percentage of our total operating revenue, revenue derived from the AMC was approximately 10.5% in 2021, 15.9% in 2020 and 24.6% in 2019. Historically, the revenues derived from expansion (or ad-hoc) flights for the AMC significantly exceeded the value of the fixed flight component of our AMC contract.\nRevenues from the AMC are derived from two-year contracts with an option for the AMC to extend the contract for two additional two-year periods. Changes in national and international political priorities can significantly affect the volume of business from the AMC. Any decrease in U.S. military activity could reduce revenue from the AMC. In addition, our share of the total business from the AMC depends on several factors, including the total fleet size we commit to the CRAF program and the total number of aircraft deployed by our teaming arrangement partners and competitors in the program.\nThe AMC also holds all carriers to certain on-time performance requirements as a percentage of flights flown and, as a result of AMC demand volatility, it has become more difficult to comply with those requirements. To the extent that we fail to meet those performance requirements or if we fail to pass biennial AMC audits, revenues from our business with the AMC could decline through a suspension or termination of our AMC contract. Our revenues could also decline due to a reduction in the revenue rate we are paid by the AMC, a greater reliance by the AMC on its own fleet or a reduction in our allocation of AMC flying. We expect revenues and profitability from our business with the AMC to continue to change as the U.S. military continues to move troops and cargo to and from areas of conflict around the world. If we are unable to effectively deploy any resultant capacity during periods of reduced flying, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business with the AMC is sensitive to teaming arrangements that affect our relative share of AMC flying and the associated revenue. If one of our team members reduces its commitments or withdraws from the program, or if other carriers on other teams commit additional aircraft, our share of AMC flying may decline. In addition, any changes made to the commissions that we pay or receive for AMC flying or changes to the contracting mechanism could impact the revenues or profitability of this business.\nEach year, the AMC allocates its air capacity requirements to different teams of participating airlines based on a mobilization value point system that is determined by the amount and types of aircraft that each team of airlines pledges to the program. We participate in the program through a teaming arrangement with other airlines, led by FedEx. Our team is one of two major teams participating in the program during our current contract year. Several factors could adversely affect the amount of AMC flying that is allocated to us, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the contracting mechanism;\n\u2022\nthe formation of new competing teaming arrangements;\n\u2022\nthe withdrawal of any of our team\u2019s current partners, especially FedEx;\n\u2022\na reduction of the number of aircraft pledged by us or other members of our team; or\n\u2022\nincreased participation of other carriers on other teams.\nAny changes that would result in a reduction in our share of, or profitability from, AMC flying could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk Related to Our Dry Leasing Business\nAny default by our Dry Lease customers, including (but not limited to) failure to make timely payments, failure to maintain insurance or failure to properly maintain our aircraft, could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur Dry Leasing business depends on the ability of our customers to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which may be affected by factors outside our control, including but not limited to: supply and demand of aircraft; competition; economic conditions; the price and availability of aircraft fuel; government regulations; the availability and cost of financing; failure to maintain insurance; and their overall financial condition and cash flow. Any default by our customers can result in reduced cash flow, termination of the lease and repossession of the related aircraft, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDry Leasing customers are primarily responsible for maintaining our aircraft. Although we require many of our customers to pay us amounts for supplemental maintenance, failure of a customer to perform required maintenance during the lease term could result in higher maintenance costs, a decrease in the value of our aircraft, the inability to re-lease aircraft at favorable rates, if at all, or impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our Dry Leasing joint venture with Bain Capital.\nRealization of the anticipated benefits from our Dry Leasing joint venture with Bain Capital is subject to a number of challenges and uncertainties, including: realization of satisfactory returns on investment, having investment goals that are consistent with our partner, partners each funding their share of required capital contributions and reaching agreement to hold and sell aircraft. If we fail to realize the expected benefits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nThe market for air cargo services is competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose current customers or fail to attract new customers. We could also be adversely affected if a large number of long-haul freighter aircraft or freighter aircraft of different equipment types are introduced into the market.\nEach of the markets in which we participate is competitive and fragmented. We offer a broad range of aviation services and our competitors vary by geographic market and type of service. Competition in the air cargo and transportation market is influenced by several key factors, including quality, price and availability of assets and services. Regulatory requirements to operate in the U.S. domestic air cargo market have been reduced, facilitating the entry into domestic markets by foreign air cargo companies. If we were to lose any major customers or fail to attract customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, an increase in the number of aircraft in the freight market could cause Yields and rates to fall or could negatively affect our customer base. If either circumstance were to occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations and failure to comply with these laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, or the adoption of any new laws, policies or regulations or changes to such regulations, may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to complex aviation and transportation laws and regulations, including Title 49 of the U.S. Code, under which the DOT and the FAA exercise regulatory authority over air carriers. In addition, our business activities and our customers\u2019 business activities fall within the jurisdiction of various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities, including the U.S. Department of Defense, the TSA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control\nand the U.S. EPA and similar state agencies. In addition, other jurisdictions in which we operate have similar regulatory regimes to which we are subjected. These laws and regulations may require us to maintain and comply with the terms of a wide variety of certificates, permits, licenses, noise abatement standards, maintenance and other requirements and our failure to do so could result in substantial fines or other sanctions. These U.S. and foreign aviation regulatory agencies have the authority to modify, amend, suspend or revoke the authority and licenses issued to us for failure to comply with provisions of law or applicable regulations and may impose civil or criminal penalties for violations of applicable rules and regulations. Such fines, sanctions or penalties, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our mode of conducting business, results of operations and financial condition. There can also be no assurance that laws and regulations will not be changed in ways that will decrease demand for our services or subject us to escalating costs. In addition, U.S. and foreign governmental authorities may adopt, amend or interpret accounting standards, tax laws, regulations or treaties that could require us to take additional and potentially costly compliance steps or result in our inability to operate some of our aircraft in certain countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInternational aviation is increasingly subject to requirements imposed or proposed by foreign governments. This is especially true in the areas of transportation security, aircraft noise and emissions control, and greenhouse gas emissions. These may be duplicative of, or incompatible with U.S. government requirements, resulting in increased compliance efforts and expense.\nForeign governments also place temporal and other restrictions on the ability of their own airlines to use aircraft operated by other airlines. For example, the European Aviation Safety Agency (\u201cEASA\u201d) requires that the aircraft capacity secured from and operated by non-EU airlines meet internationally set standards and additional EASA requirements. These and other similar regulatory developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInitiatives to address global climate change may adversely affect our business and increase our costs.\nTo address climate change, governments have implemented and continue to pursue various means to reduce aviation-related greenhouse gas emissions. Compliance with these or other measures that are ultimately adopted could result in substantial costs for us. For instance, in October 2013, the ICAO reached a nonbinding agreement to develop global market-based measures to assist in achieving carbon-neutral growth. In October 2016, the ICAO approved and subsequently amended the CORSIA, which is designed to offset any annual increases in total carbon emissions from international civil aviation above a baseline level determined by 2019 and 2020 emissions. Although various details regarding the implementation of CORSIA still need to be finalized and have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, a pilot phase began in 2021 and will run through 2023. Starting in 2019, the Airlines have voluntarily begun tracking and reporting emissions in accordance with the CORSIA methodology, even though it is not yet mandatory in ICAO member countries. As a result, starting in 2024, the Airlines may need to purchase allowances to offset their share of emissions overages based on the reporting for the 2021 to 2023 compliance period. For subsequent compliance periods, a similar procedure will apply. There is uncertainty with respect to the future supply, demand and price of sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuel, carbon offset credits and technologies that could allow us to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide.\nAdditionally, the EU continues to pursue a parallel track to address climate change through the EU ETS. Following the end of every year, to the extent the ETS applies, each airline must tender the number of Allowances corresponding to carbon emissions generated by its covered flight activity during the year. If the airline\u2019s flight activity during the year has produced carbon emissions exceeding the number of carbon emissions allowances that it has been awarded, the airline must acquire additional allowances from other airlines in the open market. In recognition of ICAO\u2019s adoption of CORSIA, the ETS has been suspended with respect to flights to and from non-European countries through December 31, 2023. However, the ETS remains applicable to intra-European flights. Additionally, various European constituencies have begun to advocate for supplemental controls on aviation greenhouse gas emissions through additional taxation and similar measures.\nIn the U.S., various constituencies have continued to advocate for controls on greenhouse gas emissions. On August 15, 2016, the EPA issued a final rule finding that greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. It is possible that these or other developments could lead to the future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the U.S. Certain\nairports have also adopted, and others could in the future adopt, greenhouse gas emission or climate-related goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure.\nIt is possible that these or similar climate change measures will be imposed in a manner adversely affecting airlines. The costs of complying with potential new environmental laws, regulations or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe airline industry is subject to numerous security regulations and rules that increase our costs. Imposition of more stringent regulations and rules than those that currently exist could materially increase our costs.\nThe TSA has increased security requirements over the past several years in response to possible increased levels of terrorist activity, and has adopted comprehensive regulations governing air cargo transportation, including all-cargo services, in such areas as cargo screening and security clearances for individuals with access to cargo. Additional measures, including a requirement to screen cargo, have been proposed, which, if adopted, may have an adverse impact on our ability to efficiently process cargo and would increase our costs and those of our customers. The cost of compliance with increasingly stringent regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR LEASE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS\nOur substantial lease and debt obligations, including aircraft leases and other obligations, could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our aircraft purchases, operations or other capital requirements, all of which could limit our financial resources and ability to compete, and may make us vulnerable to adverse economic events.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total debt obligations of approximately $2.4 billion and total aircraft operating leases and other lease obligations of $0.2 billion. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain future financing arrangements or on terms attractive to us. Our outstanding financial obligations could have negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy our debt and lease obligations;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for interest, principal and lease payments and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry.\nOur ability to service our debt and meet our lease and other obligations as they come due is dependent on our future financial and operating performance, as well as our continued access to the capital markets. All such matters are subject to various factors, including factors beyond our control, such as changes in global and regional economic conditions, changes in our industry, changes in interest or currency exchange rates, the price and availability of aircraft fuel and other costs, including labor and insurance. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service, lease and other obligations as they become due and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected under these circumstances.\nCertain of our debt and lease obligations contain a number of restrictive covenants. In addition, many of our debt and lease obligations have cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions.\nRestrictive covenants in certain of our debt and lease obligations, under certain circumstances, could impact our ability to:\n\u2022\nborrow under certain financing arrangements;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell substantially all our assets;\n\u2022\nexpand significantly into lines of businesses beyond existing business activities or those which are cargo-related or aviation-related and similar businesses; or\n\u2022\nmodify the terms of debt or lease financing arrangements.\nIn certain circumstances, a covenant default under one of our debt instruments could cause us to be in default of other obligations as well. Any unremedied defaults could lead to an acceleration of the amounts owed and potentially could cause us to lose possession or control of certain aircraft, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our convertible notes or to repurchase the convertible notes upon either a fundamental change or a make-whole fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes.\nWe issued convertible senior notes (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) in June 2015 and May 2017, which contain conditional conversion features that allow the holders of the Convertible Notes the option to convert if certain trading conditions are met or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. In the event a conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. All conversions of the Convertible Notes issued in 2015 are required to be settled in cash for the principal amount. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes issued in 2017, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nThe holders of the Convertible Notes also may require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes) at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. However, we may not have enough available cash to fund these obligations or be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Notes surrendered or Convertible Notes being converted. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under such indenture, which could result in acceleration of the principal amount of the notes and additional funding obligations by us.\nIn addition, if a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the applicable indenture), including specified corporate transactions, occurs prior to the maturity date, under certain circumstances, it would increase the conversion rate. The increase in the conversion rate would be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid (or deemed to be paid) per share of our common stock in such transaction, but in no event would increase to greater than 16.3713 shares of our common stock for our convertible notes issued in 2017 and 13.5036 shares of common stock for our convertible notes issued in 2015 per $1,000 of principal, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the conversion rates. The increase in the conversion rate for Convertible Notes converted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may result in us having to pay out additional cash in respect of the Convertible Notes upon conversion, or result in additional dilution to our shareholders if the conversion is settled partially in shares of our common stock.\nThe Convertible Note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Convertible Notes offerings, we entered into Convertible Note hedge transactions with option counterparties. The Convertible Note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of notes or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike\nprices of the warrants. Accordingly, when the Convertible Note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are taken together, the extent to which the Convertible Note hedge transactions reduce the potential dilution to our common stock (or the cash payments in excess of the principal amount of the notes) upon conversion of the notes is effectively capped by the warrant transactions at the strike price of the warrants.\nThe option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various hedging transactions, including (without limitation) derivatives, with respect to our common stock or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nU.S. citizenship requirements may limit common stock voting rights.\nUnder U.S. federal law and DOT requirements, we must be owned and actually controlled by \u201ccitizens of the United States,\u201d a statutorily defined term requiring, among other things, that not more than 25% of our issued and outstanding voting stock be owned and controlled, directly or indirectly, by non-U.S. citizens. The DOT periodically conducts airline citizenship reviews and, if it finds that this requirement is not met, may require adjustment of the voting rights of the airline\u2019s issued shares.\nAs one means to effect compliance, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide that the failure of non-U.S. citizens to register their shares on a separate stock record, which we refer to as the \u201cForeign Stock Record,\u201d results in a suspension of their voting rights. Our by-laws further limit the number of shares of our capital stock that may be registered on the Foreign Stock Record to 25% of our issued and outstanding shares. Registration on the Foreign Stock Record is made in chronological order based on the date we receive a written request for registration. As a result, if a non-U.S. citizen acquires shares of our common stock and does not or is not able to register those shares on our Foreign Stock Record, they may lose their ability to vote those shares.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law, and our issuance of warrants to Amazon, might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of AAWW and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law may render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire our company, even if such acquisition may be believed to be favorable to the interests of our stockholders. These provisions may also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the vesting of warrants issued by us to Amazon will generally, subject to certain exceptions, be accelerated upon a change of control of our company, which may discourage attempts to acquire our company.\nOur common stock share price is subject to fluctuations in value.\nThe trading price of our common shares is subject to material fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including quarterly variations in our operating results, conditions of the airfreight market and global economic conditions or other events and factors that are beyond our control.\nIn the past, following periods of significant volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has been instituted against these companies in some circumstances. If this type of litigation were instituted against us following a period of volatility in the market price for our common stock, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 91262, "SIC": 4522, "TIC": "AAWW"}
