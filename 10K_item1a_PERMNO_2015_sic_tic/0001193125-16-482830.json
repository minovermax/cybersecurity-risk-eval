{"cik": "1009672", "company": "CARBO CERAMICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur business and financial performance depend on the level of activity in the natural gas and oil industries.\nOur operations are materially dependent upon the levels of activity in natural gas and oil exploration, development and production. More specifically, the demand for our products is closely related to the number of natural gas and oil wells completed in geologic formations where ceramic or sand proppants are used in fracture treatments. These activity levels are affected by both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices. In recent years, oil and natural gas prices and, therefore, the level of exploration, development and production activity, have experienced significant fluctuations. Worldwide economic, political and military events, including war, terrorist activity, events in the Middle East and initiatives by OPEC, have contributed, and are likely to continue to contribute, to price volatility. The global supply of oil is currently at historically high levels, and there is potential for geopolitical and regulatory events, such as normalization of trade relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran, to further increase supply of oil. Additionally, warmer than normal winters in North America and other weather patterns may adversely impact the short-term demand for natural gas and, therefore, demand for our products and services. Natural gas prices experienced a significant decline during 2012 and have remained low since then, which has resulted in a decline in the United States drilling rig count. Further, the price of oil has declined precipitously since the second half of 2014. This reduction in oil and natural gas prices has depressed the level of natural gas and oil exploration, development, production and well completions activity, resulting in significantly reduced demand and pricing for our products. This decline has had and continues to have a significant adverse impact on our results. If oil and natural gas prices and well completion activity do not materially improve and/or demand for our products does not otherwise increase, this decline could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations, including, but not limited to, temporary idling all or a portion of our facilities until such time as market conditions improve.\nWe may be unable to comply with certain financial covenants under our existing credit facility, and there may be few attractive alternatives in the credit and capital markets, making it potentially difficult to secure on acceptable terms the cash needed to meet our liquidity needs.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, subject to certain limitations contained in the agreement for that facility. Our ability to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other obligations and to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility depends on our future operating performance and cash from operations and other liquidity-generating transactions, which are in turn subject to prevailing oil and natural gas prices, economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We currently believe that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under our credit facility and cash flow from other liquidity-generating transactions will enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements for the remainder of the year. However, if our future operating performance falls materially below our expectations, our plans prove to be materially inaccurate, or industry conditions do not materially improve, we may require additional financing, and there is no guarantee that such financing will be available. Moreover, our credit facility requires our compliance with certain financial covenants, and there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with them. In addition, there is no assurance our lender will agree to waive or modify these financial covenants. An event of default under our existing credit facility could have a material adverse impact on the Company and its financial condition.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and cannot amend our existing credit facility, our ability to support our liquidity needs, including, but not limited to, servicing our debt obligations will depend on our ability to access the credit and capital markets, neither of which may be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if such financing is or becomes available, future financing transactions may significantly increase the Company\u2019s interest expense, which could in turn reduce our financial flexibility and our ability to fund other activities and could make us more vulnerable to changes in operating performance or economic downturns generally. The inability to generate sufficient cash, modify our financial covenants, or obtain replacement or additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and on our ability to meet our obligations.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to access the capital or credit markets on acceptable terms or timing, or at all. Access to the capital markets and the cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by factors beyond our control, including turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in securities trading markets, the continuing downturn in the oil and gas industry and general economic conditions. Currently, we no longer qualify as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d which previously enabled us to, among other things, file automatically effective shelf registration statements. Now, even if we are able to access the capital markets, any attempt to do so could be more expensive or subject to significant delays when compared with previous periods.\nOur business and financial performance has suffered and could suffer further if the levels of hydraulic fracturing continue to decline or cease as a result of the low commodity price of oil and natural gas, development of new processes, increased regulation or a continued decrease in drilling activity.\nSubstantially all of our products are proppants used in the completion and re-completion of natural gas and oil wells through the process of hydraulic fracturing. Completion activity is directly impacted by the price of oil and natural gas. In addition, demand for our proppants is substantially higher in the case of horizontally drilled wells, which allow for multiple hydraulic fractures within the same well bore but are more expensive to develop than vertically drilled wells. A reduction in horizontal drilling or the development of new processes for the completion of natural gas and oil wells leading to a reduction in, or discontinuation of the use of, hydraulic fracturing could cause a decline in demand for our products. Additionally, increased regulation or environmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or the materials used in this process could negatively affect our business by increasing the costs of compliance or resulting in operational delays, which could cause operators to abandon the process due to commercial impracticability. Moreover, future federal, state local or foreign laws or regulations could otherwise limit or ban hydraulic fracturing. Several states in which our customers operate have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that have imposed, or could impose, more stringent permitting, transparency, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Some states, such as New York, have banned the process of hydraulic fracturing altogether. Similar efforts have been proposed in other states. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As stated elsewhere, the upstream oil and natural gas industry is in the midst of a severe contraction, resulting in a significant reduction in horizontal drilling and further resulting in a material decline in demand for our products and services.\nWe have distribution and logistical challenges in our business\nAs oil and natural gas prices fluctuate, our customers may shift their focus back and forth between different resource plays, some of which can be located in geographic areas that do not have well-developed transportation and distribution infrastructure systems. Transportation and logistical operating expenses continue to comprise a significant portion of our total delivered cost of sales. Therefore, serving our clients in these less-developed areas presents distribution and other operational challenges that affect our sales and negatively impact our operating costs. Disruptions in transportation services, including shortages of rail cars or a lack of rail transportation services or developed infrastructure, could affect our ability to timely and cost effectively deliver to our customers and could provide a competitive advantage to competitors located in closer proximity to customers. Additionally, increases in the price of diesel fuel could negatively impact operating costs if we are unable to pass\nthose increased costs along to our customers. Failure to find long-term solutions to these logistical challenges could adversely affect our ability to respond quickly to the needs of our customers or result in additional increased costs, and thus could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in an increasingly competitive market.\nThe proppant market is highly competitive. We compete with other domestic and international suppliers of ceramic proppant, as well as with suppliers of sand for use as proppant, in the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas and oil wells. The expiration of key patents owned by the Company has resulted in additional competition in the market for ceramic proppant. Specifically, Chinese manufacturers have imported ceramic proppant of varying quality into North America, which has led to an oversupply of product in the marketplace. While we believe our ceramic proppant can be differentiated from low quality imports, the oversupply in the marketplace had resulted in pricing and margin pressures. In 2014 and 2013, ceramic proppant imports from China decreased somewhat when compared to early 2012, but these imports were still present in the market. Imports of ceramic proppant from China into North America were at significantly lower levels in 2015, as demand and pricing for ceramic proppant weakened. The entry of additional competitors into the market to supply ceramic proppant or a surge in the level of ceramic proppant imports into North America could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have been and may continue to be adversely affected by decreased demand for our proppant or the development by our competitors of alternative proppants.\nCeramic proppant is a premium product capable of withstanding higher pressure and providing more highly conductive fractures than mined sand, which is the most commonly used proppant type. During 2015, we saw some operators that have traditionally used ceramic proppant experiment with the use of mined sand in its place. As commodity prices in the oil and natural gas industry have further declined, pressure on operators to reduce cost has had a detrimental impact on the demand for ceramic proppant, which is a higher cost product than mined sand. Although we believe that the use of ceramic proppant or resin-coated sand generates higher production rates and more favorable production economics than mined sand, the shifting of customer demand to lower cost products, such as mined sand or resin-coated sand, has had an adverse effect on our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The development and use of alternative proppant could also cause a decline in demand for our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely upon, and receive a significant percentage of our revenues from, a limited number of key customers and end users.\nDuring 2015, our key customers included several of the largest participants in the worldwide petroleum pressure pumping industry. Two of these customers each accounted for more than 10% of our 2015 revenues. However, the end users of our products are numerous operators of natural gas and oil wells that hire pressure pumping service companies to hydraulically fracture wells. During 2015, a majority of our ceramic proppant sales were directed to a concentrated number of end users. We generally supply our domestic pumping service customers with products on a just-in-time basis, with transactions governed by individual purchase orders. Continuing sales of product depend on our direct customers and the end user well operators being satisfied with product quality, pricing, availability and delivery performance. While we believe our relations with our customers and our end users are satisfactory, a material decline in the level of sales to any one of our major customers or loss of a key end user due to unsatisfactory product performance, pricing, delivery delays or any other reason could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe operations of our customers, and thus the results of our operations, are subject to a number of operational risks, interruptions and seasonal trends.\nAs hydraulic fracturing jobs have increased in size and intensity, common issues such as weather, equipment delays or changes in the location and types of oil and natural gas plays can result in increased variability in proppant sales volumes. Our business operations and those of our customers involve a high degree of operational risk. Natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, collisions and operator error could cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, equipment and the environment, and suspension of operations. Our customers perform work that is subject to unexpected or arbitrary interruption or termination. The occurrence of any of these events could result in work stoppage, loss of revenue, casualty loss, increased costs and significant liability to third parties. We have not historically considered seasonality to be a significant risk, but with the increase in resource plays in the northern and eastern United States as well as our operations in Marshfield, Wisconsin, our results of operations are exposed to seasonal variations and inclement weather. Operations in certain regions involve more seasonal risk in the winter months, and work is hindered during other inclement weather events. This variability makes it more difficult to predict sales and can result in greater fluctuations to our quarterly financial results. These quarterly fluctuations could result in operating results that are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, and therefore may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nThe ability of our customers to complete work, as well as our ability to mine sand from cold climate areas, could be affected during the winter months. Our revenue and profitability could decrease during these periods and in other severe weather conditions because work is either prevented or more costly to complete. If a substantial amount of production is interrupted, our cash flow and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur North American ceramic proppant production is manufactured at two plants. All of our mined sand is processed at one plant. Any adverse developments at those plants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWith the idling of our McIntyre and Millen plants, we are producing the majority of our North American ceramic production from two plants. Our Marshfield, Wisconsin plant represents 100% of our annual mined sand processing capacity. Any adverse developments at these plants, including a material disruption in production, an inability to supply the plant with raw materials at a competitive cost, or adverse developments due to catastrophic events, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide environmental warranties on certain of our containment and spill prevention products.\nFalcon Technologies\u2019 tank liners, secondary containments and related products and services are designed to contain or avoid spills of hydrocarbons and other materials. If a release of these materials occurs, it could be harmful to the environment. Although we attempt to negotiate appropriate limitations of liability in the applicable terms of sale, some customers have required expanded warranties, indemnifications or other terms that could hold Falcon Technologies responsible in the event of a spill or release under particular circumstances. If Falcon Technologies is held responsible for a spill or release of materials from one of its customer\u2019s facilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely upon intellectual property to protect our proprietary rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may affect our competitive position, and protecting our rights or defending against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.\nThe Company uses a significant amount of trade secrets, or \u201cknow-how,\u201d and other proprietary information and technology in the conduct of its business. In some cases, we rely on trade secrets, trademarks or contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property rights that are not patented. The steps we take to protect the non-patented intellectual property may not be sufficient to protect it and any loss or diminishment of such intellectual\nproperty rights could negatively impact our competitive advantage. Additionally, our competitors could independently develop the same or similar technologies that are only protected by trade secret and thus do not prevent third parties from competing with us. Furthermore, even protected intellectual property rights can be infringed upon by third parties. Monitoring unauthorized use of Company intellectual property can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may not be available.\nAlthough the Company does not believe that it is infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others by using such proprietary information and technology, it is possible that such a claim might be asserted against the Company in the future. In the event any third party makes a claim against us for infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of a third party, such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation. In addition, the Company could experience loss or cancellation of customer orders, experience product shipment delays, or be subject to significant liabilities to third parties. If our products or services were found to infringe on a third party\u2019s proprietary rights, the Company could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to continue selling its products or services. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, which could seriously harm our business. Involvement in any patent dispute or other intellectual property dispute or action to protect trade secrets and expertise could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nSignificant increases in fuel prices for any extended periods of time will increase our operating expenses.\nThe price and supply of natural gas are unpredictable, and can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other events outside of our control, such as changes in supply and demand due to weather conditions, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Natural gas is a significant component of our direct manufacturing costs and price escalations will likely increase our operating expenses and can have a negative impact on income from operations and cash flows. We operate in a competitive marketplace and may not be able to pass through all of the increased costs that could result from an increase in the cost of natural gas.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations.\nWe are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. The technical requirements of complying with these environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly expensive and complex, and may affect the Company\u2019s ability to expand its operations. Our ability to continue the expansion of our manufacturing capacity to meet market demand is contingent upon obtaining required environmental permits and compliance with their terms, which continue to be more restrictive and require longer lead times to obtain in anticipation of any efforts to expand and increase capacity. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations.\nIn addition, we use some hazardous substances and generate certain industrial wastes in our operations. Many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. These laws also may provide for \u201cstrict liability\u201d for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances.\nStricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could restrict our expansion efforts, require us to incur costs, or become the basis of new or increased liabilities. Any of these events could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.\nOur international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations.\nInternational revenues accounted for approximately 29%, 24% and 21% of our total revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We may not succeed in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets. Risks inherent in doing business on an international level include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability (including as a result of the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks);\n\u2022\npotential declines or increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices that would adversely affect our customers, the energy industry or our production costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements, economic sanctions, tariffs, customs, duties and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and costs;\n\u2022\npower supply shortages and shutdowns;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other labor problems;\n\u2022\ncurrency rate fluctuations, convertibility and repatriation;\n\u2022\ntaxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel;\n\u2022\npotential expropriation of assets by foreign governments; and\n\u2022\nother risks relating to the administration of or changes in, or new interpretations of, the laws, regulations and policies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.\nIn particular, we are subject to risks associated with our production facility in Kopeysk, Russia. The legal systems in Russia are still developing and are subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for products in Russia could be adversely impacted by changes to or interpretation of the country\u2019s law. Moreover, some parts of our Russian operations have been impacted by the imposition of trade sanctions enacted by the U.S. government in response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. These sanctions continue in place and changes to them or additional measures implemented by the U.S. government or other applicable authorities could further affect our sales and operations in the region. Further, if manufacturing in the region is disrupted, our overall capacity could be significantly reduced and sales and/or profitability could be negatively impacted.\nUndetected defects in our fracture simulation software could adversely affect our business.\nDespite extensive testing, our software could contain defects, bugs or performance problems. If any of these problems are not detected, the Company could be required to incur extensive development costs or costs related to product recalls or replacements. The existence of any defects, errors or failures in our software products may subject us to liability for damages, delay the development or release of new products and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our software products or related services, any one of which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market price of our common stock will fluctuate, and could fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock will fluctuate, and could fluctuate significantly, in response to various factors and events, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nseasonal or quarterly sales fluctuations;\n\u2022\ndifferences between our actual financial or operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections;\n\u2022\nnew statutes or regulations or changes in interpretations of existing statutes and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions; and\n\u2022\nbroad market fluctuations.\nOur actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in forward-looking statements we make.\nSome of the statements included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements relating to trends in the natural gas and oil industries, the demand for ceramic proppant and our performance in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cBusiness\u201d sections of this Form 10-K. In addition, we have made and may continue to make forward-looking statements in other filings with the SEC, and in written material, press releases and oral statements issued by us or on our behalf. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company or its officers. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
