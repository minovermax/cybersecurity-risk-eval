This report contains forward-looking statements and information concerning us, our plans, and other future events. Those statements should be read together with the discussion of risk factors set forth below, because those risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisitions and Proposed Acquisitions\nWe believe our proposed acquisition of Freedom CY, which operates as a broker-dealer in Cyprus and provides our clients in Russia and Kazakhstan greater access to the U.S. markets is probable, but we cannot predict when the acquisition, may be completed.\nThe Acquisition Agreement, under which we propose to acquire Freedom CY, specifies that the acquisition is conditioned on the satisfaction of specified regulatory requirements in Cyprus. While we have been working with CySEC for some time to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to transfer ownership of Freedom CY to the Company, and now believe receipt of such approval is probable, there is no time limit to when approval may be given and we cannot guarantee we will receive approval to close the acquisition of Freedom CY. As many of our Russian and Kazakh customers access the U.S. markets through Freedom CY, we may be required to revise our business model if we are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to transfer ownership of Freedom CY to the Company.\nThe percentage ownership of our stockholders has been reduced substantially as a result of our acquisition of FFIN and the closing of the Freedom RU acquisition and will be further substantially reduced. We may also identify and pursue additional acquisitions that could require the issuance of additional stock, which would likely further reduce the percentage ownership of our stockholders\nAs a result of the acquisition of FFIN, stockholders that previously owned 100% of our outstanding stock (the \u201coriginal BMB stockholders\u201d) were reduced to owning approximately 19.9% of our stock. With the closing of the Freedom RU acquisition, that percentage was reduced to approximately 13.2% and we have agreed, following a reverse split of our common stock, to issue additional shares to Mr. Turlov that would reduce the holdings of the original BMB stockholders to approximately 7%. If the reverse split and proposed acquisition of Freedom CY are completed, the ownership of the original BMB stockholders will be reduced to approximately 5% of our common stock. We cannot assure that the value of the retained stock of the original BMB stockholders is or will be greater when their ownership is reduced to approximately 13.2%, 7% or 5% as a result of the transfer of assets and operations to the Company as consideration for the issuance of a controlling interest in the Company.\nWe may acquire or make investments in businesses, whether complementary or otherwise, as a means to expand our business if appropriate opportunities arise. Although we cannot give assurances that we will be able to identify future suitable acquisitions or investment candidates, or, if we do identify suitable candidates, that we will be able to make the acquisitions or investments on reasonable terms or at all. The financing of any such acquisition or investment, or of a significant general expansion of our business, may not be readily available on favorable terms. Any significant acquisition or investment, or major expansion of our business, may require us to explore external financing sources, such as an offering of our equity or debt securities. We cannot be certain that in the future these financing sources will be available to us or that we will be able to negotiate commercially reasonable terms for any such financing, or that our actual cash requirements for an acquisition, investment or expansion will not be greater than anticipated. In addition, any indebtedness that we may incur in such a financing may inhibit our operational freedom, while any equity securities that we may issue in connection with such a financing may further reduce the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders.\nIn addition, we do not have extensive experience in integrating acquisitions and we could experience difficulties incorporating an acquired company's personnel, operations, technology or products and service offerings into our own or in retaining and motivating key personnel from these businesses. We may also incur unanticipated liabilities. Any such difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits and/or synergies of any such acquisition or investment.\nTimur Turlov will be subject to significant conflicts of interest in connection with the Acquisition Agreement.\nTimur Turlov will be required to make decisions about his performance under and compliance with the terms and conditions to which he is subject under the Acquisition Agreement while he is also our chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling stockholder and, therefore, has a fiduciary duty to us and our stockholders. Accordingly, he will be subject to substantial conflicts of interest in such matters. We have not adopted procedures to resolve these conflicts of interest in our favor. Further, we cannot assure that our intent to have all of our decisions respecting our performance under and compliance with the terms and conditions to which we are subject under the Acquisition Agreement determined by a majority of our disinterested, independent directors will eliminate all conflicts of interest to which such disinterested, independent directors may be subject.\nBecause we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE and NASDAQ corporate governance standards, and as a result, may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nMr. Turlov currently holds 88.6% of our issued and outstanding common stock, with the right to receive an additional 4.4% following completion of a reverse stock split. If we receive approval to transfer ownership of Freedom CY to BMBM, his ownership interest may increase to up to 95% of our outstanding common stock.\nAs a result of Mr. Turlov\u2019s acquisition of greater than 50% of the voting power of BMBM, we became a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance standards of the NYSE and NASDAQ. Controlled companies are exempt from compliance with the listing standards of the NYSE and NASDAQ regarding majority board independence or the independence requirements relating to certain compensation and nominating committee decisions, and in the case of the NYSE, corporate governance committees. We are not currently subject to the corporate governance standards of the NYSE or NASDAQ, but should we at some future date become subject to such standards while still being a controlled company, we could be eligible to take advantage of the exemptions from compliance with such corporate governance standards. If we take advantage of the exemptions from compliance with such corporate governance standards, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nMr. Turlov has control over key decision making as a result of his ownership of a majority of our voting stock.\nMr. Turlov, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, beneficially owns approximately 88.6% of our outstanding common stock, which could increase to as much as 95%. Mr. Turlov currently has sole voting control of BMBM and can control the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, a reverse stock split and recapitalization the Company, and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, Mr. Turlov has the ability to control our management and affairs as a result of his position as our chief executive officer and his ability to control the election of our directors. Additionally, in the event that Mr. Turlov controls BMBM at the time of his death, control may be transferred to a person or entity that he designates as his successor. As a board member and officer, Mr. Turlov owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Turlov is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nRisks Related to Effecting Securities Transactions for Foreign Customers\nThe Freedom Companies\u2019 business would be negatively impacted if Freedom CY is unable to maintain its relationship with a U.S. securities broker-dealer and clearing firm willing to receive and transmit funds internationally.\nFunds invested by customers of the Freedom Companies\u2019 in U.S. securities are transmitted to a U.S. securities broker-dealer and clearing firm and by the U.S. securities broker-dealer and clearing firm back to the Freedom Companies\u2019 customers through international banking electronic transfers, which can experience clerical and administrative mistakes, be subject to technical interruption, be delayed, or otherwise fail to work as planned. Neither Freedom CY, nor the Freedom Companies have any control over these funds transfers. Failures or substantial delays in funds transfers could impair the Freedom Companies\u2019 customer relationships.\nThe Freedom Companies must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) in their operations in Russia and Kazakhstan.\nThe Freedom Companies will be required to conduct their activities in compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Enforcement officials interpret the FCPA\u2019s prohibition on improper payments to government officials to apply to officials like those of the state-operated Federal Financial Markets Service of Russia and the Committee for the Control and Supervision of the Financial Market and Financial Organizations of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the principal regulatory bodies that would control and monitor our operations in Russia and Kazakhstan. While the employees and agents of Freedom Companies will be required to acknowledge and comply with these laws, we cannot assure that their internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may expose us to fines and other sanctions and adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.\nForeign laws, regulations, and policies may change in ways that could adversely impact our business.\nThe Freedom Companies securities broker-dealer and banking activities for customers in Russia and Kazakhstan are and will continue to be subject to ongoing uncertainties and risks, including:\n\u25cf\npossible changes in government personnel, the development of new administrative policies, practices, and political conditions in Russia, Kazakhstan, or Cyprus that may affect the enforcement or administration of laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\npossible changes to the laws, regulations, and policies applicable to their customers or the securities business generally;\n\u25cf\nthe potential adoption of entirely new regulatory regimes for foreign investment, the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries, and the permitted financial activities of residents;\n\u25cf\nuncertainties as to whether the laws and regulations will be applicable in any particular circumstance;\n\u25cf\nuncertainty as to whether the Freedom Companies will be able to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the applicable governing authorities, their compliance with governmental requirements;\n\u25cf\ncurrency exchange rates, regulations, or limitations;\n\u25cf\npolitical instability and possible changes in government;\n\u25cf\nlocal and national tax requirements;\n\u25cf\nexpropriation or nationalization of private enterprises and other risks arising out of foreign government sovereignty over properties in Russia and Kazakhstan; and\n\u25cf\npossible significant delays in obtaining governmental authorizations, consents, or approvals of applicable requirements.\nOur customers are concentrated in Russia and Kazakhstan such that any impediment to their investments and other activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRussia and Kazakhstan have changing regulatory regimes, regulatory policies, and interpretations.\nRussia and Kazakhstan have regulatory regimes governing the operation of broker-dealers within those countries, the transfer of funds to and from such countries, and other aspects of the finance, investment and banking industries. These provisions were promulgated during changing political circumstances, are continuing to change, and may be relatively untested, particularly insofar as they apply to foreign investments by residents. Therefore, there is little or no administrative or enforcement history or established practice that can aid us in evaluating how the regulatory regimes will affect the Freedom Companies\u2019 operations. It is possible that those governmental policies will change or that new laws and regulations, administrative practices or policies, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations will materially and adversely affect the Freedom Companies\u2019 activities in Russia or Kazakhstan. Further, since the history and practice of industry regulation is sparse, the Freedom Companies\u2019 activities may be particularly vulnerable to the decisions and positions of individuals, who may change, be subject to external pressures, or administer policies inconsistently. Internal bureaucratic politics may have unpredictable and negative consequences. The profitability of the Freedom Companies could also be affected by changes to rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, changes to these rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business the Freedom Companies conduct, modifications to their business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, or additional costs. These changes may also require the Freedom Companies to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to their compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions.\nInternational currency exchange rates may affect the investment practices of the customers of the Freedom Companies.\nThe customers of the Freedom Companies seek to invest in U.S. securities in part to dampen the financial risk of domestic currency fluctuations and to invest in dollar-denominated securities. Even though the Freedom Companies\u2019 customers\u2019 investments in U.S. securities are dollar-denominated, the funds available to customers to invest will depend on the rates at which the dollar is convertible into the currency of the country in which they reside-principally the Russian ruble and the Kazakh tenge. Declines in the value of the Russian ruble or the Kazakh tenge compared to the U.S. dollar reduce the amounts that residents of those countries have to invest in the U.S. Conversely, increases in the value of the Russian ruble and the Kazakh tenge relative to the U.S. dollar reduces the financial advantage of investing in U.S. securities. Customer expectations respecting applicable currency exchange rates may affect the timing, number, and amounts of customer transactions in U.S. securities. Accordingly, the Freedom Companies\u2019 businesses may be affected substantially by currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIt may be difficult for us to enforce any civil liabilities against our customers that are outside the United States.\nThe customers of the Freedom Companies are residents of countries outside of the U.S. and beyond the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. As a result, it may be difficult for us to enforce within the U.S. any claims or seek any remedies against such foreign persons, including claims, remedies, or judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. or any state. Instead, we, or our subsidiaries, may as a practical matter, be forced to rely on remedies under foreign laws as interpreted and enforced by foreign courts, which generally would not enforce U.S. laws or enforce or interpret contracts consistent with U.S. legal principles or precedent. Further, such foreign courts and laws in Russia and Kazakhstan are based on non-Western principles of jurisprudence and may not provide the same kinds of remedies, relief, or procedural safeguards that are familiar in U.S. or Western legal systems.\nInternational currency exchange rates will affect the investment practices of our customers.\nThe customers of the Freedom Companies seek to invest in U.S. securities in part to dampen the financial risk of domestic currency fluctuations and to invest in dollar-denominated securities. Even though the Freedom Companies\u2019 customers\u2019 investments are dollar-denominated, the funds available to customers to invest will depend on the rates at which the dollar is convertible into the currency of the country in which they reside-principally the Russian ruble and the Kazakh tenge. Declines in the value of the Russian ruble or the Kazakh tenge compared to the U.S. dollar reduce the amounts that residents of those countries have to invest in the United States. Conversely, increases in the value of the Russian ruble and the Kazakh tenge relative to the U.S. dollar reduces the financial advantage of investing in U.S. securities. Customer expectations respecting applicable currency exchange rates may affect the timing, number, and amounts of customer transactions in U.S. securities. Accordingly, our business may be affected substantially by currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nRisks Related Generally to our Business\nWe may not be able to generate positive cash flow and profitability.\nOur ability to generate positive cash flow and profitability depends on the ability of the Freedom Companies to generate and maintain revenue greater than the level of expenses we incur. Their ability to do this depends, among other things, on:\n\u25cf\nmaintenance and increase of their customer base;\n\u25cf\nmanagement of the quality of their services;\n\u25cf\neffective competition with existing and potential competitors;\n\u25cf\nfurther development of their business activities;\n\u25cf\nattraction and retention of qualified personnel;\n\u25cf\nability to limit operating costs;\n\u25cf\nintegration of their activities and the broader development of an integrated securities brokerage and banking business;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with the regulatory regimes in each of the jurisdictions in which they operate; and\n\u25cf\nmaintenance of adequate working capital.\nWe will be unable to achieve/maintain profitability if the Freedom Companies fail to do any of the foregoing. We cannot be certain that the Freedom Companies will be able to consistently generate positive cash flow and profitability in the future. Their inability to consistently generate profitability or positive cash flow could result in disappointing financial results, impede implementation of their growth strategy, or have an adverse impact on the trading price or volume of our common stock. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will be able to generate the cash flow and profits necessary to sustain our business.\nDevelopments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the business of the Freedom Companies.\n\ufeff\nThe businesses of the Freedom Companies can be adversely affected by the general environment, including economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates and overall investor engagement, and are outside their control. Deterioration in the credit markets, reductions in short-term interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact their results of operations and capital resources.\nFailure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect the financial condition of the Freedom Companies.\n\ufeff\nThe Freedom Companies must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of their capital and internal assessment of their capital needs. These net capital rules may limit the ability of each Freedom Company to transfer capital to the Company or any other Freedom Company. New regulatory capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how each Freedom Company utilizes its capital, and may require a Freedom Company to increase its capital and/or liquidity or to limit its growth. Failure by any Freedom Company to meet its minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us.\nA significant decrease in liquidity could negatively affect the business and financial management of the Freedom Companies as well as reduce client confidence.\n\ufeff\nMaintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the Freedom Companies. They meet their liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings, as well as cash provided by external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits or market conditions, may affect their ability to meet their liquidity needs. A reduction in their liquidity position could reduce customer confidence, which could result in the loss of customer accounts, or could cause them to fail to satisfy their liquidity requirements. In addition, if they fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit their operations.\nFactors which may adversely affect their liquidity position include having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, unanticipated outflows of company cash, fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage customer accounts, a dramatic increase in customer lending activities (including margin and personal lending), increased capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a loss of market or customer confidence.\n\ufeff\nIf cash generated by customer activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for their liquidity needs, they may be forced to seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets.\n\ufeff\nThe Freedom Companies may suffer significant losses from credit exposures.\n\ufeff\nThe business of the Freedom Companies is subject to the risk that a customer, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While the Freedom Companies have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective to protect the Freedom Companies against the risk of loss. The exposure of the Freedom Companies results principally from margin lending, clients\u2019 options trading, futures activities, securities lending, their role as a counterparty in financial contracts, investing activities, and indirectly from proprietary investing of the Freedom Companies own funds.\n\ufeff\nWhen customers purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, the Freedom Companies are subject to the risk that customers may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of the customers\u2019 indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of customers to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses.\n\ufeff\nThe Freedom Companies have exposure to credit risk associated with their investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the Russia, Kazakhstan and U.S. financial markets\u2019 assessment of credit quality. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired. The evaluation of whether other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of several factors. If management determines that a security is OTTI, the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings. Deterioration in the performance of available for sale securities could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. Even if a security is not considered OTTI, if the Freedom Company holding the security were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, that Freedom Company would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time.\nThe Freedom Companies\u2019 investments expose them to a significant risk of capital loss.\nThe Freedom Companies use a portion of their own capital in a variety of investment activities, each of which involves risks of illiquidity, loss of principal and revaluation of assets. The companies in which they invest may concentrate on markets which are or may be disproportionately impacted by pressures in the sectors on which they focus, and their existing business operations or investment strategy may not perform as projected. As a result, they have suffered losses in the past and may suffer losses from their investment activities in the future.\nThe Freedom Companies\u2019 investments are concentrated in relatively few companies and industries and a consequence of this investment strategy is that their investment returns will be materially and adversely affected if the companies or the industries they target perform poorly. As a result, if a significant investment fails to perform as they anticipated their business, financial condition and results of operations could be more negatively affected and the magnitude of the loss could be more significant than if they had made smaller investments in more companies and industries.\nEven if the Freedom Companies make appropriate investment decisions based on the intrinsic value of an enterprise, we cannot assure you that the market value of the investment will not decline, perhaps materially, as a result of general market conditions or changes in law. For example, an increase in interest rates, a general decline in the stock markets, or other market conditions adverse to companies or investment funds of the type in which the Freedom Companies invest could result in a decline in the value of their investments. Additionally, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof, or new laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on the business and industries in which the Freedom Companies invest.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively affect the value of investments the Freedom Companies make with their capital, which could result in reduced earnings or losses.\nFrom time to time, the Freedom Companies invest capital in interest rate sensitive securities. \u201cLong\u201d investments that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations will decline in value if long-term interest rates increase, and \u201cshort\u201d investments that are sensitive to interest rate risk will decline in value if long-term interest rates decrease. Declines in market value may ultimately reduce earnings or result in losses to us.\nFreedom RU and Freedom KZ are subject to risks associated with their securities lending business.\nFreedom RU and Freedom KZ have an active securities borrowed and loaned business in which they borrow securities from one party and lend them to another. As a result, market risk in their securities lending business arises when the market value of securities borrowed declines relative to the cash they post as collateral with the lender; and when the market value of securities they have loaned increases relative to the cash they have received as collateral from the borrower. Market value fluctuations in their securities lending business are measured daily and any exposure versus cash received or posted is settled daily with counterparties. In addition, credit risk from their securities lending operations arises if a lender or borrower defaults on an outstanding securities loan or borrowing transaction and the cash or securities they are holding is insufficient to cover the amount they owe the Freedom Companies for that receivable. Finally, there is systemic risk associated with the concentration of clearing and related functions in covered clearing agencies involved in securities lending activities. The market and credit risks associated with their securities lending business have the potential of adversely impacting their business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating risks associated with Freedom RU and Freedom KZ\u2019s securities lending business may result in counterparty losses, and in certain circumstances, potential financial liabilities.\nAs part of their securities lending business, Freedom RU and Freedom KZ lend securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of their clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. The Freedom Companies must manage this process and are charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. Failure to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for counterparties in the securities lending business (separate from the risks of collateral investments) of Freedom RU and Freedom KZ. Additionally, in certain circumstances, Freedom RU or Freedom KZ could potentially be held liable for the failure to manage any such risks.\nLarger and more frequent capital commitments in the trading and underwriting businesses of Freedom RU and Freedom KZ increase the potential for them to incur significant losses.\nFreedom RU and Freedom KZ commit their capital to maintain trading positions in the equity, convertible securities and debt markets. They may enter into large transactions in which they commit their own capital as part of their client trading activities. The number and size of these large transactions may adversely affect our results of operations in a given period. Although they may take measures to manage market risk, such as employing inventory position limits and using quantitative risk measures, they may incur significant losses from their trading activities due to market fluctuations and volatility in their results of operations. To the extent that they own assets, i.e., have long positions, in any of those markets, a downturn in the value of those assets or in those markets could result in losses. Conversely, to the extent they have sold assets they do not own, i.e., have short positions, in any of those markets, an upturn in those markets could expose them to potentially large losses as they attempt to cover their short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market.\nWe are a holding company and are dependent on our subsidiaries for funds.\nSince we are a holding company, our cash flow and consequent ability to satisfy our obligations is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings as dividends or loans or other payments by those subsidiaries to us. Our subsidiaries are subject to various capital adequacy requirements promulgated by regulatory and other authorities. These regulatory rules may restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our subsidiaries by dividends, loans or other payments. Additionally, our ability to participate as an equity holder in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon liquidation is generally subordinate to the claims of creditors of the subsidiary.\nThe operations and infrastructure of the Freedom Companies may malfunction or fail.\nThe broker-dealer, financial services and banking businesses are highly dependent on processing, on a daily basis, a large number of communications and increasingly complex transactions across diverse markets, in different languages. The financial, accounting, or other data processing systems the Freedom Companies, or the firms that clear transactions on behalf of their customers, use may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond their control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or their inability to occupy one or more of our facilities. The inability of these systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain their ability to expand their businesses. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled, or if there are other shortcomings or failures in their internal processes, personnel, or systems, they could suffer impairment to their liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or reputation damage.\nThey also face the risk of operational failure of any of the exchanges, depositories, clearing houses, clearing firms or other financial intermediaries they use to facilitate their securities transactions. Any such failure or termination could adversely affect their ability to effect transactions and to manage their exposure to risk.\nTheir ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports their business and the communities in which they and third parties with which they conduct business are located, including disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation, or other services, whether due to fire, other natural disaster, power or communications failure, act of terrorism, war, or otherwise. The Freedom Companies have employees in a number of cities in Russia and Kazakhstan, all of who need to work and communicate as an integrated team. If a disruption occurs in one location and their employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations, their ability to service and interact with their clients may suffer, and they may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. We do not maintain insurance policies to mitigate these risks because it may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit. Further, any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain of these risks may not cover these losses.\nTheir operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Their computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. The occurrence of one or more of these events could: (a) jeopardize confidential and other information processed by, stored in, and transmitted through their computer systems and networks or the computer systems and networks of their customers or other third parties with which they conduct business; or (b) otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in their operations or the operations of their customers or third parties with which they conduct business. They may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify their protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and they may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance.\nIn addition to the risk of systems failures or interruption from benign but nevertheless disruptive causes, the systems they use and rely on may also be vulnerable to intentional unauthorized access, vandalism, software interruption, data corruption, or other mischief by unauthorized third parties, or \u201chackers.\u201d Such efforts may be directed at them and their business specifically, which might disrupt their operations, or generally to broadly based, international financial, banking, and communications systems, which could disrupt broad segments of the financial and banking systems worldwide. Any such disruptions could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe Freedom Companies are dependent on their executive management teams, in particular Timur Turlov, and they may not be able to execute their business plan in the event that members of their executive management teams are no longer available to them and they are unable to find suitable replacements for them or the members of their executive management teams do not dedicate a sufficient amount of their professional time to their endeavors.\nThe Freedom Companies depend on the efforts, skill, reputations and business contacts of the executive management teams of the Freedom Companies, in particular Timur Turlov, and we believe their success depends to a significant extent upon the experience of these individuals, whose continued service is not guaranteed. We have no assurance that the services of these executive management teams will continue to be available to the full extent of the needs of the Freedom Companies. If certain members of the executive management teams leave or are otherwise no longer available to their respective Freedom Company or are not available to the full extent of their needs, they may not be able to replace them with suitable management and may be unable to execute their business plan.\n\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffIt may be difficult for our stockholders to enforce any civil liabilities against us or our officers or directors, because many of our officers and operations are, and are expected to be, outside the United States.\nThe assets of the Freedom Companies are located outside the United States. Several of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, with all or a substantial portion of each person\u2019s assets located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against us or our officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state. Further, it may be difficult for investors to enforce in foreign countries judgments obtained in the United States.\nPricing and other competitive pressures may impair the revenue and profitability of the Freedom Companies.\nThe Freedom Companies derive their revenues from brokerage, banking and financial services businesses serving customers in Russia and Kazakhstan. Investing by retail customers, particularly in U.S. securities, is an emerging market in those countries, and we expect the Freedom Companies will encounter intense price competition in this business as this industry matures with more competitive service providers. We believe the Freedom Companies may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas as existing or new competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price or service. In addition, their retail brokerage business will likely face pressure from larger competitors, which may be better able to offer a broader range of complementary products and services to retail brokerage clients in order to win their trading business. The inability of the Freedom Companies to compete effectively with their competitors in these areas would adversely affect their business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFrom time-to-time the Freedom Companies may be subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending themselves against claims or proceedings.\n\ufeff\nThe financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks. From time-to-time the Freedom Companies may be subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. From time-to-time they may also be the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.\n\ufeff\nActions brought against them may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to them including reputational harm. Even if they are successful in defending against such actions, the defense of such matters may result in them incurring significant expenses. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on our results for that period. In market downturns, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased.\nRisks Related to Owning our Stock\nA significant percentage of our outstanding common stock is owned or controlled by Timur Turlov, whose interests may differ from those of other stockholders.\nTimur Turlov, our chairman and chief executive officer, owns approximately 88.6% of our outstanding common stock, which could increase to as high as 95% as contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement. Therefore, Mr. Turlov will be able to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, the approval of our proposed recapitalization, and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us and might affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our organizational documents may be potentially detrimental to our common stockholders.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to fix the relative rights and preferences of our 20,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, without approval from our stockholders. This could affect the rights of our common stockholders regarding, among other things, voting, distributions, dividends and liquidation. We could also use the preferred stock to deter or delay a change in control of our Company that may be opposed by our management, even if the transaction might be favorable to our common stockholders.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink market, our stock trades sporadically, with limited volume. We cannot assure that a more active trading market will develop. Accordingly, our stockholders may not be able to sell our shares when they want or at the price they want.\nPenny stock regulations will impose certain restrictions on resales of our securities, which may cause an investor to lose some or all of its investment.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share that is not traded on a national securities exchange or that has an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. As a result, our common stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction before the purchase. Further, if the price of the stock is below $5.00 per share and the issuer does not have $2,000,000 or more net tangible assets or is not listed on a registered national securities exchange, sales of such stock in the secondary trading market are subject to certain additional rules promulgated by the SEC. These rules generally require, among other things, that brokers engaged in secondary trading of penny stocks provide customers with written disclosure documents, monthly statements of the market value of penny stocks, disclosure of the bid and asked prices, and disclosure of the compensation to the broker-dealer and the salesperson working for the broker-dealer in connection with the transaction. These rules and regulations may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock, thereby effectively limiting the liquidity of our common stock. These rules may also adversely affect the ability of persons that acquire our common stock to resell their securities in any trading market that may exist at the time of an intended sale.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Section 12 of the Exchange Act. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation, and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year when the aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and nonvoting common equity held by our nonaffiliates is $75 million or more on the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, but less than $700 million. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 91437, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "FRHC"}
