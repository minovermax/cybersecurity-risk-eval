Risk Factors.\nThe following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.\nRegulatory\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are highly regulated, and the laws and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations.\nJPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. The regulation of financial services is extensive and comprehensive.\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced an extended period of significant change in laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry, both within and outside the U.S. The supervision of financial services firms also expanded significantly during this period. The wave of increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations. Existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require JPMorgan Chase to make further changes to its business and operations. These changes could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations and could reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability. More specifically, existing and new laws and regulations could require JPMorgan Chase to:\n\u2022\nlimit the products and services that it offers\n\u2022\nreduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities\n\u2022\nstop or discourage it from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue\n\u2022\nrecognize losses in the value of assets that it holds\n\u2022\npay higher assessments, levies or other governmental charges\n\u2022\ndispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on certain business activities, or\n\u2022\nincrease the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.\nDifferences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business.\nThe content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:\n\u2022\nlarger firms are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation\n\u2022\nfinancial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or\n\u2022\nthe financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.\nThese types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in a firm such as JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.\nThere can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory initiative or standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:\n\u2022\nthe resolution of financial institutions\n\u2022\nthe establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies\n\u2022\nthe separation (or \u201cring fencing\u201d) of core banking products and services from markets activities\n\u2022\nrequirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d)\n\u2022\nposition limits and reporting rules for derivatives\n\u2022\ngovernance and accountability regimes\n\u2022\nconduct of business requirements, and\n\u2022\nrestrictions on compensation.\nPart I\nThese types of differences in financial services regulation, or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions, could require JPMorgan Chase to:\n\u2022\ndivest assets or restructure its operations\n\u2022\nabsorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs\n\u2022\nchange the prices that it charges for its products and services\n\u2022\ncurtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients, or\n\u2022\nincur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks.\nAny or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, results of operations and profitability.\nGovernments in some countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business have adopted laws or regulations which require JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries that operate in those jurisdictions to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity on a stand-alone basis. Some regulators outside the U.S. have also proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those jurisdictions. These requirements, and any future laws or regulations that impose restrictions on the way JPMorgan Chase organizes its businesses or increase the capital or liquidity requirements that would apply to JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries, could hinder JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to efficiently manage its operations, increase its funding and liquidity costs, and result in lower profitability.\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where JPMorgan Chase does business. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs or needing to comply with other restrictions.\nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the\nactivities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\n\u2022\ngreater exposure in civil litigation\n\u2022\ndamage to reputation\n\u2022\ndisqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or\n\u2022\nother direct and indirect adverse effects.\nFurthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:\n\u2022\nloss of clients, customers and business\n\u2022\nrestrictions on offering certain products or services, and\n\u2022\nlosing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.\nJPMorgan Chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions. JPMorgan Chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions. Furthermore, if JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators, it could be required to:\n\u2022\nenter into further resolutions\n\u2022\npay additional regulatory fines, penalties or judgments, or\n\u2022\naccept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.\nIn these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.\nThe long-term impact of U.S. tax reform legislation is uncertain, and may be affected by regulatory implementation.\nThe long-term impact of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Acts (\u201cTCJA\u201d) on JPMorgan Chase and the U.S. economy remains uncertain. While the enactment of the TCJA has had, and should continue to have, a positive impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s net income, the competitive environment and other\nfactors will influence the extent to which these benefits are retained by JPMorgan Chase over the longer term, and the specific impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, products and geographies may vary. In addition, the Treasury Regulations governing certain TCJA provisions have not been finalized and their ultimate impact on JPMorgan Chase is uncertain.\nComplying with economic sanctions and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational and compliance costs and risks.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and similar national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S., as well as anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations throughout the world. JPMorgan Chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements. Furthermore, a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws and regulations could subject JPMorgan Chase, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations can be constrained in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.\nIf the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less established or predictable, this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business. For example, any of the following could hamper JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and reduce its earnings in countries with less established or predictable legal and regulatory regimes:\n\u2022\nthe absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions\n\u2022\nthe adoption of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations\n\u2022\nuncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual obligations\n\u2022\ndifficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive, and\n\u2022\nthe threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.\nConducting business in countries with less-developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires JPMorgan Chase to\ndevote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that JPMorgan Chase will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators.\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies\u2019 evaluation of the Firm\u2019s resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs.\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s growth, activities or operations. After two years, if the deficiencies are not cured, the agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and strategy.\nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the \u201cParent Company\u201d) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (\u201celigible LTD\u201d) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either:\n\u2022\nin a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or\n\u2022\nin a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (\u201cTitle II\u201d).\nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.\nPart I\nThe preferred \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy under JPMorgan Chase\u2019s resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company\u2019s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company\u2019s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid.\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy.\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred strategy.\nPolitical\nThe expected departure of the U.K. from the EU could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, results of operations and operating model.\nIt remains highly uncertain how the expected departure of the U.K. from the EU, which is commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d will affect financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase that conduct substantial operations in the EU from legal entities that are organized in or operating from the U.K. It is possible that the U.K. will depart from the EU in March 2019 without any agreement having been reached between the U.K. and the EU concerning whether or to what extent U.K.-based firms may conduct financial services activities within the EU. It is also possible that any agreement reached between the U.K. and the EU may, depending on the final outcome of the ongoing negotiations and related legislative developments:\n\u2022\nimpede the ability of U.K.-based financial services firms to conduct business in the EU\n\u2022\nfail to address significant unresolved issues relating to the cross-border conduct of financial services activities, or\n\u2022\napply only temporarily.\nJPMorgan Chase has been making the necessary modifications to its legal entity structure and operations in the EU, the locations in which it operates and the staffing in those locations to address the expected departure of the U.K. from the EU, including the possibility that the U.K. may depart from the EU in March 2019 without a withdrawal agreement in place. If the U.K. departs from the EU with no withdrawal agreement having been reached, the types of structural and operational changes that JPMorgan Chase is in the process of making to its European operations will result in JPMorgan Chase having to sustain a more fragmented operating model across its U.K., EU and other operating entities. Due to considerations such as operating expenses, liquidity, leverage and capital, the modified European operating framework will be more complex, less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case. JPMorgan Chase may experience these types of inefficiencies in its business and operations even if a withdrawal agreement is reached, for example in the event that during the transition period contemplated by such an agreement, the U.K. and the EU fail to reach further agreement on future trade relationships between the U.K. and the EU, or if any other outcome persists that does not assure ongoing access for U.K.-based financial services firms to the EU market.\nA disorderly departure of the U.K. from the EU, or the unexpected consequences of any departure, could have significant and immediate destabilizing effects on cross-border financial services activities, depending on circumstances that may exist following such a withdrawal, including:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that clients and counterparties of financial institutions are not positioned to continue to do business through EU-based legal entities\n\u2022\nreduction or fragmentation of market liquidity that may be caused if trading venues or CCPs currently based in the U.K. have not completed arrangements to conduct operations from the EU either immediately or, if authorized to continue to operate from the U.K. on a transitional basis, after any transitional relief has expired\n\u2022\nuncertainties concerning the application and interpretation of laws and regulations relating to cross-border financial services activities\n\u2022\ninability to engage in certain capital markets activities through EU-based legal entities to the extent that licenses or temporary permission to engage in such activities have not been granted timely by local regulators, and\n\u2022\nlack of legal certainty concerning the treatment of existing transactions.\nAny or all of the above factors could have an adverse effect on the overall operation of the European financial services market as well as JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, operations and earnings in the U.K., the EU and globally.\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\nThe economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the U.S. and other countries. Certain policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in U.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets, including:\n\u2022\ninability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open and funded\n\u2022\nisolationist foreign policies\n\u2022\nthe introduction of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or\n\u2022\nthe possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the \u201cGSEs\u201d).\nThese types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:\n\u2022\nerode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency\n\u2022\nprovoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations\n\u2022\nincrease concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time, and\n\u2022\nresult in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries.\nThese factors could lead to:\n\u2022\ngreater market volatility\n\u2022\nlarge-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries\n\u2022\nthe widening of credit spreads\n\u2022\ninflationary pressures\n\u2022\nlower investment growth, and\n\u2022\nother market dislocations.\nAny of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment securities portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, hamper its ability to deliver products and\nservices to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are materially affected by economic and market events and conditions.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:\n\u2022\ninvestor, consumer and business sentiment\n\u2022\nevents that reduce confidence in the financial markets\n\u2022\ninflation or deflation\n\u2022\nhigh unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of capital and credit\n\u2022\nmonetary and fiscal policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any suspension or reversal of large-scale asset purchases\n\u2022\ntrade policies implemented by governmental authorities\n\u2022\nthe economic effects of natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, and\n\u2022\nthe health of the U.S. and global economies.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:\n\u2022\ninterest rates\n\u2022\nthe rates of inflation and unemployment\n\u2022\nhousing prices\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer and small business confidence\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt, and\n\u2022\nthe number of personal bankruptcies.\nA rapid increase in interest rates could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. Sustained low growth, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses. These conditions could also increase the cost to provide those products and services. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity,\nPart I\nor where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:\n\u2022\npolicies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration and employment status\n\u2022\nthe inability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open and funded, and\n\u2022\npolicies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as infrastructure spending and global trade, which could result in higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income.\nIn addition, governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could, if enacted into law, encourage certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers.\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale businesses.\nIn JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital markets businesses could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:\n\u2022\nearn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions\n\u2022\ndispose of portions of credit commitments, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings, at a loss, or\n\u2022\nhold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress.\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.\nAn economic downturn that results in lower consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Severe and sustained adverse economic conditions could reduce the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from those properties which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing higher delinquencies, defaults and write-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its wholesale businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s investment securities portfolio and market-making positions can suffer losses due to adverse economic, market and political events and conditions.\nJPMorgan Chase generally maintains positions in various fixed income instruments in its investment securities portfolio, and positions in various fixed income, currency, commodity, credit and equity instruments as part of its market-making activities. Market-making positions are intended to facilitate demand from JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients for these instruments and to provide liquidity for clients. The value of the positions that JPMorgan Chase holds can be significantly affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to effectively hedge market and other risks on its positions\n\u2022\nchanges in the levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads, and market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility, and\n\u2022\nthe availability of liquidity in the capital markets.\nAll of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions on market-making activities.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s investment securities portfolio and market-making businesses can also suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:\n\u2022\nsevere declines in asset values\n\u2022\nunexpected credit events\n\u2022\nunforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa), or\n\u2022\nother market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.\nIf JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment securities portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue and income streams.\nJPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are increasing. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:\n\u2022\nfewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans\n\u2022\nlosses on underwriting exposures\n\u2022\nlower returns on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s investment securities portfolio\n\u2022\nthe loss of deposits to the extent that JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior\n\u2022\nlower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings, and\n\u2022\nless liquidity in the financial markets and higher funding costs.\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenues and its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans.\nOn the other hand, a low interest rate environment may cause:\n\u2022\nnet interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments, and\n\u2022\na reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s mortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments, particularly during periods of market displacement. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations.\nUnder extreme market conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Furthermore, under these conditions, market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves. However, severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and JPMorgan Chase could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur.\nPart I\nCredit\nJPMorgan Chase can be adversely affected by the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.\nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other types of financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation in the event that a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, including under the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.\nA default by a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses.\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses can be harmed by the insolvency of a significant market participant.\nThe failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant, can have a cascading effect within the financial markets. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting. These risks could be magnified in the event of the default, insolvency or resolution of a major global financial counterparty, as JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a counterparty, and would seek to unwind or hedge positions in securities, derivatives and other obligations in multiple jurisdictions during a period of heightened market volatility.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s clearing services business is exposed to the risk of client or counterparty default.\nAs part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is a member of several CCPs. In the event that another member of such an organization defaults on its obligations to the CCP, JPMorgan Chase may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the CCP as a result of that default. As a clearing member, JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client\u2019s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to bearing its share of nondefault losses incurred by a CCP due to a business or operational failure affecting the CCP, including due to a cyberattack, litigation, fraud or a systems failure.\nJPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit risk may be further increased when JPMorgan Chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to it. Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties:\n\u2022\nengage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries\n\u2022\ndo business in the same geographic region, or\n\u2022\nhave business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.\nFor example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other\nborrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses.\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.\nDisruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets could cause JPMorgan Chase to be unable to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions in various debt instruments, loans, derivatives and other obligations, and thereby lead to increased risk concentrations. If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWA\u201d) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital requirements and funding costs and adversely affect the profitability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is critical to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to fund and operate its businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as:\n\u2022\nmarket-wide illiquidity or disruption\n\u2022\nunforeseen cash or capital requirements\n\u2022\ninability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices\n\u2022\ndefault by a CCP or other significant market participant\n\u2022\nunanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\n\u2022\nunexpected loss of consumer deposits caused by changes in consumer behavior, and\n\u2022\nlack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general.\nA diminution of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, periods of low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity resulted in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity, including securitized debt issuances. There is no assurance that severe conditions of this type will not occur in the future.\nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:\n\u2022\nsatisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements\n\u2022\naddress obligations under its resolution plan, or\n\u2022\nsatisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.\nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the \u201cIHC\u201d). The IHC in turn holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to the holding company.\nThe holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also\nPart I\nlimited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity \u201cthresholds\u201d are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management or Board of Directors.\nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\npay interest on its debt securities\n\u2022\npay dividends on its equity securities\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and\n\u2022\nfulfill its other payment obligations.\nThese regulatory restrictions and limitations could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.\nReductions in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:\n\u2022\nexpected future profitability\n\u2022\nrisk management practices\n\u2022\nlegal expenses\n\u2022\nratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries\n\u2022\nregulatory developments\n\u2022\nassumptions about government support, and\n\u2022\neconomic and geopolitical trends\nJPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase\u2019s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nreducing its access to capital markets\n\u2022\nmaterially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities\n\u2022\ntriggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and\n\u2022\ndecreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.\nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.\nThe regulation, reform and replacement of benchmark rates could have adverse consequences on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s securities issuances and its capital markets and investment activities.\nInterest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be \u201cbenchmarks,\u201d including those in widespread and long-standing use, have been the subject of ongoing international, national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration. These reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated.\nAny of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed or implemented, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to benchmarks. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks.\nAny of these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued, funded or held by JPMorgan Chase.\nVarious regulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks. There is no assurance that these new rates will be accepted or widely used by market participants, or that the characteristics of any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace. If a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative rate has not been successfully introduced to replace that benchmark, this could result in widespread\ndislocation in the financial markets, engender volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and suppress capital markets activities, all of which could have adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the transition of a particular benchmark to a replacement rate could affect hedge accounting relationships between financial instruments linked to that benchmark and any related derivatives, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021, and there is a substantial risk that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. Vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the LIBOR benchmark, and any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could, as noted above, result in disruption in the financial markets, suppress capital markets activities and give rise to litigation claims, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations and on LIBOR-linked securities or other instruments which are issued, funded or held by JPMorgan Chase.\nOperational\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are highly dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems depends on:\n\u2022\nthe quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and\n\u2022\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nJPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and\nother market participants, including clearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, security and technology companies.\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:\n\u2022\ndelays or other disruptions in providing information, services and liquidity to clients and customers\n\u2022\nthe inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets\n\u2022\nthe possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences\n\u2022\nfinancial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers\n\u2022\nhigher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable\n\u2022\nclient or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and services\n\u2022\nloss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, or\n\u2022\nharm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nAs the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continues to increase, it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:\n\u2022\nerrors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption\n\u2022\nisolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues\n\u2022\nfailures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors due to design flaws, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and\n\u2022\nthird parties attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.\nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems, or those of external parties on which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses depend, are unable to meet the demanding standards of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and operations, or if they fail\nPart I\nor have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. For example, ineffective controls over newly-developed electronic trading platforms could inadvertently permit the rapid build-up of unexpected, abnormal or unusually large positions in securities or other financial instruments, or fail to anticipate or address a downturn in market liquidity which leads to sudden or severe changes in asset prices. Any significant failure to identify and mitigate operational risks associated with new products or services or new platforms for delivering or distributing products or services, or changes to existing products, services or delivery platforms, could diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:\n\u2022\npotential liability to clients, counterparties and customers\n\u2022\nincreased operating expenses\n\u2022\nhigher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions\n\u2022\ndamage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\n\u2022\nimpairment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity\n\u2022\nregulatory intervention, or\n\u2022\nweaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s connections to external operational systems expose it to greater operational risks.\nExternal operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown of another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s security and control systems,\nincluding through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services.\nIf an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:\n\u2022\nheightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems\n\u2022\nlosses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws and regulations\n\u2022\nincreased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party\u2019s security breach, and\n\u2022\nharm to reputation arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems may not be secure.\nAs JPMorgan Chase\u2019s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties expands, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction.\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, central agents, CCPs, payment processors, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to conduct business.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations depend on the competence and integrity of its employees and those of external parties.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, and to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, is highly dependent on the competence and trustworthiness of its employees, as well as employees of other parties on which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations rely, including vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an\nemployee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations depend.\nJPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected parties can include:\n\u2022\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and customers, and prospective clients and customers\n\u2022\nclients and customers of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and customers\n\u2022\nemployees and prospective employees, and\n\u2022\nemployees of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s vendors, counterparties and other external parties.\nEnsuring that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:\n\u2022\nincrease JPMorgan Chase\u2019s compliance and operating costs\n\u2022\nhinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers\n\u2022\ndemand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management, and\n\u2022\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways.\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase cannot ensure that all of its clients and customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:\n\u2022\nerroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or\n\u2022\nintercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties.\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection\nlaws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.\nRecent, well-publicized allegations involving the misuse or inappropriate sharing of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information and the use or sharing of personal data by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws and regulations relating to the use and sharing of personal information. These types of laws and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase\u2019s use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers. These restrictions could inhibit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.\nA successful cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.\nJPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyberattacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis. These cyberattacks can take many forms, but a common objective of many of these attacks is to introduce computer viruses or malware into JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems. These viruses or malicious code are typically designed to:\n\u2022\nobtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees\n\u2022\nmanipulate or destroy data\n\u2022\ndisrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems, or\n\u2022\nsteal money.\nJPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services.\nJPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks. However, JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.\nPart I\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches. This is because:\n\u2022\nthe techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched\n\u2022\ncyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally, and\n\u2022\nthird parties may seek to gain access to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems.\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as JPMorgan Chase continues to expand its mobile-payments and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of web-based products and applications.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nsignificant disruption of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators\n\u2022\ndamage to computers or systems of JPMorgan Chase and those of its clients, customers and counterparties\n\u2022\ninability to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions\n\u2022\nviolations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws\n\u2022\nfinancial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients, customers, counterparties or employees\n\u2022\nloss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s cybersecurity measures\n\u2022\ndissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients, customers or counterparties\n\u2022\nsignificant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and\n\u2022\nharm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase could also suffer some of the above consequences if a third party were to misappropriate\nconfidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees.\nJPMorgan Chase may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a security breach due to a cyberattack.\nA successful breach of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s computer systems, software, networks or other technology assets due to a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to:\n\u2022\nthe breadth of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and the high volume of transactions that it processes\n\u2022\nthe large number of customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which JPMorgan Chase does business\n\u2022\nthe proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.\nThe extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyberattack, and that damage may continue to spread. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyberattack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations, results and reputation could be harmed by catastrophes or other events.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including:\n\u2022\ncyberbreaches or breaches of physical premises, including data centers\n\u2022\npower, telecommunications or internet outages\n\u2022\nfailures of, or loss of access to, operational systems, including computer systems, servers, networks and other technology assets\n\u2022\ndamage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or severe weather conditions\n\u2022\nhealth emergencies or pandemics, or\n\u2022\nevents arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts.\nJPMorgan Chase maintains a firm-wide resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure the ability to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. Furthermore, should emergency or catastrophic events such as severe or abnormal weather conditions become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting.\nAny significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations or operational systems, or any catastrophic event, could:\n\u2022\nhinder JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties\n\u2022\nrequire it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption\n\u2022\ncause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries\n\u2022\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and\n\u2022\nharm its reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management framework and procedures may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management framework is intended to mitigate risk and loss. The framework includes both the \u201cfirst line of defense,\u201d consisting of each line of business and Treasury and the Chief Investment Office, including their aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management groups, and the \u201csecond line of defense,\u201d consisting of Independent Risk Management. JPMorgan Chase has established processes and procedures to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject. However, there are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may be existing or future risks that JPMorgan Chase has not appropriately anticipated or identified.\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management framework, governance structure, procedures and practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any such inadequacy or lapse could:\n\u2022\nrequire significant resources to remediate\n\u2022\nattract heightened regulatory scrutiny\n\u2022\nexpose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings\n\u2022\nsubject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\n\u2022\nharm its reputation, or\n\u2022\ndiminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting.\nJPMorgan Chase establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures. It then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. They require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. It is possible that JPMorgan Chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.\nMany of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior. These strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management\u2019s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate.\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to assess and implement mitigating controls over its market, credit, liquidity, operational and other risks. These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to\nPart I\nidentify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nreliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict future events, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations which predict correlation among certain market indicators or asset prices\n\u2022\ninherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes\n\u2022\nhistorical trend information may be incomplete, or may not anticipate severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity\n\u2022\ntechnology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology\n\u2022\nmodels and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and\n\u2022\nreview processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.\nSome of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase\u2019s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital actions could also be constrained if a CCAR submission is not approved by its banking regulators due to the perceived inadequacy of its models or estimations.\nEnhanced standards for vendor risk management can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with doing business with vendors and other third-party service providers. These requirements are contained both in bank regulatory regulations and guidance and in certain consent orders to which JPMorgan Chase has been subject. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s failure to appropriately assess and manage third-party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in:\n\u2022\npotential liability to clients and customers\n\u2022\nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\n\u2022\nincreased operational costs, or\n\u2022\nharm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nRequirements for physical settlement and delivery in trading agreements could expose JPMorgan Chase to operational and other risks.\nCertain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s markets transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that JPMorgan Chase does not own. If JPMorgan Chase is unable to obtain the obligations within the required timeframe, JPMorgan Chase could forfeit payments otherwise due. Failures could also result in settlement delays, which could damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation and ability to transact business. Failure to timely settle and confirm transactions could also subject JPMorgan Chase to heightened credit and operational risk, and losses in the event of a default.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect.\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation. Certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial statements, including:\n\u2022\ntrading assets and liabilities\n\u2022\ninstruments in the investment securities portfolio\n\u2022\ncertain loans\n\u2022\nMSRs\n\u2022\nstructured notes, and\n\u2022\ncertain repurchase and resale agreements.\nWhere quoted market prices are not available for these types of financial instruments, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. Sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments, which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted. If estimates or judgments underlying JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial statements prove to have been incorrect, JPMorgan Chase may experience material losses.\nLapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability or reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could:\n\u2022\nmaterially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and results of operations or financial condition\n\u2022\nrestrict its ability to access the capital markets\n\u2022\nrequire it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies\n\u2022\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\n\u2022\nharm its reputation, or\n\u2022\notherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies.\nThe preparation of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as more detailed accounting policies established by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management. From time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change, and in some cases these changes could have a material effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results.\nFor example, on January 1, 2020, JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. companies will be required to implement a new accounting standard, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) framework, which will require earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments, replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use. JPMorgan Chase expects that under CECL, it will need to, among other things, increase the allowance for credit losses related to its loans and other lending-related commitments, which may have a negative impact on its capital levels.\nThis new accounting standard may result in greater volatility of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings and capital levels over economic cycles and could potentially affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital distribution plans, depending upon final guidance from the regulators. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could be adversely impacted by associated changes in the competitive environment in which it operates, including changes in the availability or pricing of loan products, particularly during periods of economic stress, as well as changes related to non-U.S. financial institutions or other competitors that are not subject to this new accounting standard.\nStrategic\nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s competitive standing and results could suffer.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and results of operations. These strategies relate to:\n\u2022\nthe products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers\n\u2022\nthe geographies in which it operates\n\u2022\nthe types of clients and customers that it serves\n\u2022\nthe counterparties with which it does business, and\n\u2022\nthe methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services.\nIf management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s growth and prospects also depend on management\u2019s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management\u2019s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:\n\u2022\ndevise effective business plans and strategies\n\u2022\neffectively implement business decisions, including minimizing bureaucratic processes\n\u2022\ninstitute controls that appropriately address the risks associated with business activities and any changes in those activities\n\u2022\noffer products and services that are appropriately priced, meet the changing expectations of clients and customers and are delivered in ways that enhance client and customer satisfaction\n\u2022\nallocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment\n\u2022\nallocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations\n\u2022\nadequately respond to regulatory requirements\n\u2022\nappropriately address shareholder concerns\nPart I\n\u2022\nreact quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or\n\u2022\ndevelop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\nAdditionally, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Board of Directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of management\u2019s strategic decisions, and a failure by the Board to perform this function could also impair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations.\nConduct\nConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chase\u2019s commitment to \u201cdo first class business in a first class way.\u201d JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee\u2019s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s promotion and compensation processes.\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct, and these instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation as well as resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees will not occur or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants or other employees. Some examples of this include:\n\u2022\nimproperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s products or services\n\u2022\nengaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading\n\u2022\nfacilitating illegal or aggressive tax-motivated transactions, or transactions designed to circumvent economic sanction programs\n\u2022\nfailing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers\n\u2022\nviolating anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants to manipulate markets, prices or indices\n\u2022\nengaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment\n\u2022\nmaking risk decisions in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk appetite to employee compensation objectives, and\n\u2022\nmisappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.\nThe consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:\n\u2022\nfinancial losses\n\u2022\nincreased operational and compliance costs\n\u2022\ngreater regulatory scrutiny\n\u2022\nregulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities\n\u2022\nthe need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management\nloss of clients or customers, and\n\u2022\nharm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nReputation\nDamage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could harm its businesses.\nMaintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and prospects. Harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation can arise from numerous sources, including:\n\u2022\nemployee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches, including cyberattacks\n\u2022\nfailure to safeguard client or customer information\n\u2022\nnot appropriately managing social and environmental risk issues associated with its business activities or those of its clients\n\u2022\ncompliance or operational failures\n\u2022\nlitigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of certain third parties to comply with laws or regulations, including companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors and other third parties with which JPMorgan Chase does business.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.\nSocial and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to the health of consumers, or whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers\u2019 rights or communities. Activists have also engaged in public protests at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s headquarters and other properties. Activist criticism of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses social and environmental concerns in its business activities. Alternatively, yielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s relationships with clients and customers, and with governmental bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, whose views are not aligned with those of social and environmental activists. In either case, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could:\n\u2022\ncause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase\n\u2022\nimpair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers\n\u2022\ndiminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to hire or retain employees, or\n\u2022\nprompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients.\nAny of the above factors could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations and its ability to maintain its competitive standing.\nActions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation. For example, concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or that a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers, can damage the reputation of the industry as a whole. If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have\nengaged in these types of behaviors, the measures needed to address the associated reputational issues could increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational and compliance costs and negatively affect its earnings.\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as its business activities encompass more transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:\n\u2022\nadequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest\n\u2022\ndeliver appropriate standards of service and quality\n\u2022\ntreat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care\n\u2022\nuse client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations\n\u2022\nprovide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or\n\u2022\nhandle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations.\nIn the future, a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nCountry\nAdverse economic and political developments in a country or region, or globally, can have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and earnings can be affected by the monetary, fiscal and other policies adopted by regulatory authorities and agencies in the countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. Changes in fiscal policies by central banks or regulatory authorities, and the manner in which those policies are executed, are beyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s control and may be difficult to predict. Consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies or the ways in which they are implemented could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nSome countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase operates or invests, or in which JPMorgan Chase may do business in the future, have in the past experienced severe\nPart I\neconomic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. Concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries, or the possibility that a particular country may decide to depart from a trade, monetary or political pact, can result in a deterioration of economic and market conditions within the affected countries or regions, including:\n\u2022\nslowing growth rates, rising inflation or recessionary economic conditions\n\u2022\na contraction of available credit\n\u2022\ndiminished investor and consumer confidence, including loss of confidence in local banking systems\n\u2022\nincreased market volatility\n\u2022\nreduced commercial activity among trading partners, or\n\u2022\nthe potential for currency redenomination or the dissolution of a political or economic alliance or treaty.\nAny or all of these factors could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and results of operations in the affected country or region.\nThese developments can also lead to a contagion which causes similar conditions to arise in other countries in the same region or beyond. Furthermore, governments in particular countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase or its clients do business may choose to adopt protectionist economic or trade policies in response to concerns about domestic economic conditions or as countermeasures to policies or actions taken by other countries or regions. Any or all of these developments could lead to diminished cross-border trade and financing activity within that country or region, all of which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and earnings in those jurisdictions and increase its operational costs. If JPMorgan Chase takes steps to reduce its market and credit risk exposure within a particular country or region that is experiencing economic or political disruption, it may incur losses that are higher than expected because it will be disposing of assets when market conditions are likely to be highly unfavorable.\nAn outbreak of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses within the affected region or globally.\nAggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyberattacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:\n\u2022\nworldwide economic disruption\n\u2022\nheightened volatility in financial markets\n\u2022\nsevere declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments\n\u2022\nsubstantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region\n\u2022\ndisruption of global trade, and\n\u2022\ndiminished consumer, business and investor confidence.\nAny of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and earnings, both in the countries or region directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyberattacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business activities with governmental entities can pose an enhanced risk of loss.\nSeveral of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, both within and outside the U.S. These activities can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may:\n\u2022\ndefault on or restructure its obligations\n\u2022\nclaim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, or\n\u2022\nrepudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government.\nAny or all of these actions could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and could hurt its reputation, particularly if JPMorgan Chase pursues claims against a government obligor in a jurisdiction in which it has significant business relationships with clients or customers.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and revenues in emerging markets can be hampered by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.\nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which JPMorgan Chase operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including:\n\u2022\nextreme currency fluctuations\n\u2022\nhigh inflation\n\u2022\nlow or negative growth, and\n\u2022\ndefaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt.\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, including:\n\u2022\nprice, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions\n\u2022\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations.\nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. For example, some or all of these governmental actions can result in funds belonging to JPMorgan Chase, or that it places with a local custodian on behalf of a client, being effectively trapped in a country. In addition to the ultimate risk of losing the funds entirely, JPMorgan Chase could be exposed for an extended period of time to the credit risk of a local custodian that is now operating in a deteriorating domestic economy.\nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions and related governmental actions, including:\n\u2022\nsocial unrest\n\u2022\ngeneral strikes and demonstrations\n\u2022\ncrime and corruption\n\u2022\nsecurity and personal safety issues\n\u2022\noutbreaks of hostilities\n\u2022\noverthrow of incumbent governments\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks, and\n\u2022\nother forms of internal discord.\nThese economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S.\nCompetition\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations will suffer if it is not a strong, effective and forward-looking competitor.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:\n\u2022\nother banks and financial institutions\n\u2022\ntrading, advisory and investment management firms\n\u2022\nfinance companies and technology companies, and\n\u2022\nother nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services.\nJPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.\nNew competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s costs for complying with laws and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those new technologies.\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits and bank accounts. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other\nPart I\nfactors, could affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.\nNon-U.S. competitors of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale businesses outside the U.S. are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial services institutions can put JPMorgan Chase and those firms at a competitive disadvantage to non-U.S. competitors. This could reduce the revenue and profitability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale businesses, resulting from:\n\u2022\nprohibitions on engaging in certain transactions\n\u2022\nhigher capital and liquidity requirements\n\u2022\nmaking JPMorgan Chase\u2019s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients, and\n\u2022\nadversely affecting JPMorgan Chase\u2019s cost structure for providing certain products.\nPeople\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.\nUnfavorable changes in immigration policies could adversely affect the quality of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and operations.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make structural changes to its worldwide operating model that are less efficient or more costly.\nLegal\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.\nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nIf another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase.\nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.", "PERMNO": 47896, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "JPM"}
