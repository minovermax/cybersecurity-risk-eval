{"cik": "885508", "company": "STRATUS PROPERTIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the United States (U.S.) federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical fact, such as plans, projections or expectations. For additional information, see \u201cCautionary Statement\u201d in Items 7. and 7A. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, notwithstanding any changes in our assumptions, business plans, actual experience, or other changes. We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, expected, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements are discussed below. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors described herein are not all of the risks we may face. Other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially and adversely affect our business if they occur, and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. Moreover, new risks emerge from time to time. Further, our business may also be affected by general risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S., which have not been included.\nRisks Relating to the Pending Sale of Block 21\nThe closing of the pending sale of Block 21 is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not be completed in accordance with expected plans, on the currently contemplated timeline, or at all, and the pending sale may be disruptive to the operations and profitability of our hotel and entertainment businesses.\nAs previously announced and discussed elsewhere in this report, on October 26, 2021, we entered into new agreements to sell Block 21 to Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. (Ryman) for $260.0 million, subject to downward adjustments up to $5.0 million. The properties and operations of Block 21 constitute all of the properties and operations of our hotel and entertainment businesses.\nThe Block 21 transaction is currently targeted to close sometime prior to June 1, 2022, subject to the timely satisfaction or waiver of various closing conditions, including the consent of the loan servicer to the purchaser\u2019s assumption of the existing mortgage loan; the consent of the hotel operator, an affiliate of Marriott, to the purchaser\u2019s assumption of the hotel operating agreement; the absence of a material adverse effect; and other customary closing conditions. Ryman has deposited $5.0 million in earnest money to secure its performance under the agreements governing the sale. If the conditions to the closing of the sale of Block 21 are neither timely satisfied nor, where permissible, waived on a timely basis or at all, we may be unable to complete the sale of Block 21 or such completion may be delayed beyond our expected timeline for the sale.\nWhether or not the proposed sale of Block 21 is completed, the prior announcement and current pendency of the sale may be disruptive to Block 21\u2019s businesses and may adversely affect current or prospective relationships with guests, customers, employees, suppliers and tenants. Uncertainties related to the pending sale could divert the attention of management and other employees from the day-to-day operations of Block 21 in preparation for and during the completion of the sale. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks, Block 21\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nIf the proposed sale of Block 21 is delayed or not completed for any reason, we will have expended significant management resources in an effort to complete the sale and will have incurred significant transaction costs. Accordingly, if the proposed sale of Block 21 is not completed on the terms set forth in the definitive agreements governing the sale, or at all, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe cannot provide assurances that the sale of Block 21 will result in additional value being realized by our shareholders.\nIf completed, the sale of Block 21 is anticipated to provide us with substantial net cash proceeds. Our remaining businesses would consist of our traditional real estate operations segment and the remainder of our leasing operations segment. We are evaluating options for the use of the net proceeds of the sale and for our future real estate and leasing operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to redeploy the capital we obtain from the sale of Block 21 in a way that would result in additional value to our shareholders, or that we will engage in any transaction or transactions that will result in our shareholders realizing additional value from the sale.\nFurther, in order to secure our subsidiaries\u2019 responsibilities for the accuracy of certain representations and warranties in the agreements governing the sale of Block 21, $6.9 million will be held in escrow for 12 months after the closing, subject to a longer retention period with respect to any required reserve for pending claims. We cannot assure you that we will eventually receive all or any of the amounts held in escrow.\nRisks Relating to our Indebtedness\nWe need significant amounts of cash to service our debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur industry is capital-intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to secure land and pursue development and construction. We have relied on cash flow from operations and our debt agreements as our primary sources of funding. We have also relied on third-party project-level equity financing of our subsidiaries, which increased during 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our outstanding debt totaled $106.6 million and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $24.2 million, excluding $136.7 million of debt and $9.2 million of cash and cash equivalents associated with Block 21 included in discontinued operations. Our level of indebtedness could have significant adverse consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022Increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales to pay or provide for our indebtedness, thus reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, development projects, capital expenditures, land acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022Limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022Force us to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on unfavorable terms;\n\u2022Place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022Limit our ability to obtain future financing to fund our working capital, our development activities, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other financing needs; and/or\n\u2022Limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or cause the refinancing terms to be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled debt service payments or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future operating and financial performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control, including risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Historically, much of our debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business. Our inability to extend, repay or refinance our debt when it becomes due, including upon a default or acceleration event, could allow our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the loans due and payable, seek to foreclose on the collateral securing the loans and/or seek to force us into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, any difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital for planned development expenditures could also cause project delays, which could increase our costs, or could cause us to abandon projects already underway. There can be no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, make necessary capital expenditures, or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nOur current financing arrangements contain, and our future financing arrangements likely will contain, financial and restrictive covenants, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default that accelerates the required payment of such debt.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness include restrictive covenants, including covenants that require that certain financial ratios be maintained. The debt arrangements that we and our subsidiaries have contain significant limitations that may restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things: borrow additional money or issue guarantees; pay dividends, repurchase equity or make other distributions to equityholders; make loans, advances or other investments; create liens on assets; sell assets; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; enter into transactions with affiliates; permit a change of control; sell all or substantially all of our assets; and engage in mergers, consolidations or other business combinations. See \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" in Part II, Items 7. and 7A. and Note 6 for additional discussion of restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nFailure to comply with any of the restrictive covenants in our loan documents could result in a default that may, if not cured or waived, accelerate the payment under our debt obligations which would likely have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to obtain waivers or modifications of covenants from our lenders and lenders may require fees or higher interest rates to grant any such requests. Certain of our debt arrangements have cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, which could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. We cannot assure you that we could adequately address any such defaults, cross-defaults or acceleration of our debt payment obligations in a sufficient or timely manner, or at all. Our ability to comply with our covenants will depend upon our future economic performance. These covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations, satisfy our capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be desirable or advantageous to us.\nIn order to maintain compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements and carry out our business plan, we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital, including project-level equity financing of our subsidiaries. Such additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, when needed. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.\nRisks Relating to our Business and Industries\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on us, particularly our hotel and entertainment businesses, which may continue.\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The pandemic and the public health response to minimize its impact have had significant disruptive effects on global economic and market conditions. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, government responses to the pandemic included mandated closures of businesses not deemed essential, closures of schools and public buildings, stay-at-home orders, mask mandates and crowd restrictions, and individuals and businesses adopted self-imposed restrictions in an effort to protect their health and the health of their employees. During 2020 and 2021, the U.S. experienced multiple periods of declines followed by resurgences of new cases, leading to cycles of tightening and subsequent lessening of governmental and voluntary restrictions. During 2021, the impacts of the pandemic began to lessen as vaccines became widely available in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2021, although there have been periodic increases in the number of cases in the U.S. as a result of vaccine hesitancy and the spread of COVID-19 variants. In March 2021, the Governor of Texas lifted the mask mandate in Texas and increased the capacity of all businesses and facilities in the state to 100 percent. While the U.S. economy generally improved in 2021 compared to 2020, many industries, including ours, have been experiencing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Inflation, including energy costs, has also increased significantly.\nThe pandemic had an adverse impact on our business and operations, particularly our hotel and entertainment businesses\u2019 revenues, profitability and cash flows. Our hotel experienced low average occupancy in 2020 and 2021, rising to 52 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our entertainment venues, ACL Live and 3TEN ACL Live, had only a limited number of events in 2020 and the first eight months of 2021, until opening up to full capacity in August 2021. The pandemic resulted in a \u201cTrigger Period\u201d under our project loan for Block 21, which restricts our ability to receive cash distributions from Block 21, and we have contributed cash to Block 21 to meet its obligations. Our former agreements entered into in 2019 to sell Block 21 to Ryman were terminated by Ryman in May 2020 as a result of the negative impact on capital markets and the overall economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic at the time. In our leasing operations, we proactively engaged with our project lenders in connection with\nformulating rent deferral arrangements for our tenants during 2020, and obtaining concessions under our loan agreements. Other impacts of the pandemic are described throughout this report. As the pandemic continues to evolve, we cannot predict the extent to which individuals and businesses may voluntarily restrict their activities, the extent to which governments may reinstitute restrictions, nor the extent to which evolving pandemic developments may have an adverse impact on the economy or our business. Some or all of the effects of the pandemic described above may continue, recur or worsen and there may be other effects that we do not anticipate. Further, any future major public health crisis could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA decline in general economic conditions, particularly in Austin, Texas, could harm our business.\nPeriods of economic uncertainty, weakness or recession; declining employment levels; declining consumer confidence and spending; declining access to capital; global instability; or the public perception that any of these events or conditions may occur, be present or worsen, may negatively affect our business. These economic conditions can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition, disposition, development and leasing activity, a general decline in the value of real estate and in rents, and increases in tenant defaults. Our business is especially sensitive to economic conditions in Austin, Texas, where the majority of our properties are located. As a result of a decline in economic conditions, the value of our real estate may be reduced, increasing the risk for asset impairments, our development projects may be delayed or we may experience a decline in demand for our real estate, and we could realize losses or diminished profitability. Russia began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, causing global economic disruptions including increases in energy prices, and the ultimate impact of the war on global economic conditions and on our business cannot yet be determined.\nIncreases in inflation and interest rates raises our costs.\nInflation reached a near 40-year high in late 2021, and continued to be high in early 2022, driven in large part by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the economy in the U.S. generally improved and demand increased during 2021 compared to 2020, supply and labor shortages contributed to rising prices. As 2021 progressed, we experienced increases in costs of land, construction materials and labor, and those costs may increase further if inflation accelerates. Inflationary pressures have been exacerbated in 2022 by the war in Ukraine. In addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates. Interest rates in the U.S. generally began rising over the last few months, and may increase further. Our consolidated debt at December 31, 2021, was $106.6 million, the majority of which was variable-rate debt, excluding debt associated with Block 21, which is fixed-rate and included in discontinued operations. An increase in interest rates increases our interest costs and increases the costs of refinancing existing debt and incurring new debt, which adversely affects our profits and cash flow.\nWe are vulnerable to concentration risks because our operations are primarily located in the Austin, Texas area.\nOur real estate operations are primarily located in the Austin, Texas area. While our real estate operations have expanded to include select markets in Texas outside of the Austin area, the geographic concentration of the majority of our operations and of the properties we may have under development at any given time means that our business is more vulnerable to local economic, regulatory, adverse weather and other conditions than the businesses of larger, more diversified companies. The performance of the Austin area's economy and our other select markets in Texas greatly affects our revenue and the values of our properties. We cannot assure you that these markets will continue to grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will continue to be favorable in these markets. See \u201cOverview of Financial Results for 2021 - Real Estate Market Conditions\u201d in Part II, Items 7. and 7A. for more information.\nWe could be impacted by our investments through joint ventures, which involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole owner.\nDuring 2021, we increased our use of third-party equity financing of our subsidiaries\u2019 development projects. We may continue to fund development projects through the use of such joint ventures. Joint ventures involve risks including but not limited to the possibility the other joint venture partners may possess the ability to take or force action contrary to our interests or withhold consent contrary to our requests, have business goals which are or become inconsistent with ours, or default on their financial obligations to the joint venture, which may require us to fulfill the joint venture\u2019s financial obligations as a legal or practical matter. We and our joint venture partners may each have the right to initiate a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire a joint venture\npartner\u2019s interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction. In addition, a sale or transfer by us to a third party of our interests in the joint venture may be subject to consent rights or rights of first refusal in favor of our partners which would restrict our ability to dispose of our interest in the joint venture. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate, finance, or dispose of a joint venture project in our sole discretion is limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement. See Note 2 for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures.\nAdverse weather conditions, public safety issues, political instability, and other potentially catastrophic events in our Texas markets could adversely affect our business.\nAdverse weather conditions, including natural disasters, public safety issues, political instability, and other potentially catastrophic events in our Texas markets may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse weather conditions may be amplified by the effects of climate change. These events may delay development activities, interrupt our leasing, hotel and entertainment operations, or damage property resulting in substantial repair or replacement costs to the extent not covered by insurance. Any of these factors could cause shortages and price increases in labor or raw materials, reduce property values, or cause a loss of revenue, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate to cover any losses we may incur and our insurance costs may increase.\nWe maintain insurance on our properties, including business interruption, property, liability, fire and extended coverage. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economical to insure. Further, insurance companies often increase premiums, require higher deductibles, reduce limits, restrict coverage, and refuse to insure certain types of risks, which may result in increased costs or adversely affect our business. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles, for insurance, based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. In addition, we may become liable for injuries and accidents at our properties that are underinsured. A significant uninsured loss or increase in insurance costs could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of key personnel could negatively affect our business.\nWe depend on the experience and knowledge of our executive officers and other key personnel who guide our strategic direction and execute our business strategy, have extensive market knowledge and relationships and exercise substantial influence over our operations. Among the reasons that these individuals are important to our success is that each has a regional industry reputation that attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants, community stakeholders and industry personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could negatively affect our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions and cybersecurity breaches.\nMany of our business processes depend on technology systems to conduct day-to-day operations and lower costs, and therefore, we are vulnerable to the increasing threat of information technology disruptions and cybersecurity breaches. These risks include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, phishing, ransomware, credential attacks, unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, employee theft or misuse and the corruption of data. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, and similar events. A significant theft, loss, loss of access to, or fraudulent use of guest, employee, or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in a loss of business, as well as remedial and other expenses, fines, and litigation. There can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective.\nWe have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. While these cybersecurity incidents did not result in any material loss to us or interrupt our day-to-day operations as of March 28, 2022, there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such losses in the future. Further, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats.\nFailure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth.\nWe have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future, properties that are outside of the Austin, Texas area, which is our primary market. Our historical experience in existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets. Entering into new markets exposes us to a variety of risks, including difficulty evaluating local market conditions and local economies, developing new business relationships in the area, competing with other companies that already have an established presence in the area, hiring and retaining personnel, evaluating quality tenants in the area, and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. Furthermore, expansion into new markets may divert management's time and other resources away from our current primary market. As a result, we may not be successful in expanding into new markets, which could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our growth.\nPart of our business strategy depends on maintaining strong relationships with key tenants and our inability to do so could adversely affect our business.\nWe have formed strategic relationships with key tenants as part of our overall strategy for particular development projects and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future. For example, our West Killeen Market, Jones Crossing, Kingwood Place, Magnolia Place and New Caney mixed-use development projects are each anchored by an H-E-B L.P. grocery store. Any deterioration in our relationship with H-E-B or our inability to form and retain strategic relationships with key tenants or enter into other similar arrangements in the future could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to Real Estate Operations\nThere can be no assurance that the properties in our development pipeline will be completed in accordance with the anticipated timing or cost.\nWe currently have several projects at various stages of development. The development of the projects in our pipeline is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022inability to obtain entitlements;\n\u2022inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms;\n\u2022default by any of the contractors we engage to construct our projects;\n\u2022site accidents; and\n\u2022failure to secure tenants or residents in the anticipated time frame, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe can provide no assurances that we will complete any of the projects in our development pipeline on the anticipated schedule or within the budget, or that, once completed, these properties will achieve the results that we expect. If the development of these projects is not completed in accordance with our anticipated timing or cost, or the properties fail to achieve the financial results we expect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and ability to repay our debt, including project-related debt.\nRisks associated with our ownership of substantial amounts of undeveloped land or land under development could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe own a substantial amount of undeveloped land and land under development. If demand for real estate, residential or multi-family properties deteriorates, we may not be able to develop or complete development of our land profitably, may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land we own, may choose to forfeit deposits on land controlled through options or purchase contracts, and may choose to sell land for prices lower than our costs, which may cause impairment charges or losses.\nIt may be difficult for us to sell our real estate at times and prices advantageous to us.\nReal estate is a relatively illiquid asset. It may be difficult for us to sell our real estate quickly if the need or desire arises, at prices or on terms we find acceptable. This may limit our ability to make rapid adjustments in the size and content of our property assets in response to changes in economic or other conditions, may constrain our ability to pay our debts, and may lead to impairment charges or losses. See \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Part II, Items 7. and 7A. for more information.\nSignificant competition could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur competitors include local developers who are committed primarily to particular markets and also regional and national developers who acquire and develop properties throughout the U.S. Many of our competitors are larger and financially stronger than we are, have more resources than we do, and have greater economies of scale and lower cost structures. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and profitability will be adversely affected.\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are greatly affected by the performance of the real estate industry.\nThe U.S. real estate industry is highly cyclical and is affected by global, national and local economic conditions, general employment and income levels, availability of financing, interest rates, and consumer confidence and spending. Other factors impacting real estate businesses include over-building, a decline in brick-and-mortar retail industry, changes in traffic patterns, changes in demographic conditions, changes in tenant and buyer preferences and changes in government requirements, including tax law changes. These factors are outside of our control and may have a material adverse effect on our business, profits and the timing and amounts of our cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to an intensive regulatory approval process and opposition from environmental and special interest groups, either or both of which could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such developments entirely.\nReal estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. Before we can develop a property, we must obtain a variety of approvals from local and state governments with respect to such matters as zoning and other land use entitlements and issues, and subdivision, site planning and environmental issues under applicable regulations. Obtaining all of the necessary permits and entitlements to develop a parcel of land is often difficult and costly, and may take several years or more to complete. In some situations, we may be unable to obtain the necessary permits and/or entitlements to proceed with a real estate development or may be required to alter our plans for the development. In addition, the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Any of these may limit, delay or increase the costs of acquisition of land and development of our properties. Because government agencies and special interest groups have, in the past, expressed concerns about certain of our development plans, and in the future may express similar concerns, our ability to develop these properties and realize future income from our properties could be delayed, reduced, prevented or made more expensive. In addition, any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in capital or operating expenditures or significant financial penalties or restrictions on our operations that could adversely affect present and future operations or our ability to sell, and thereby, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to environmental regulation, which can change at any time and could increase our costs. Further, increasing climate change concerns may increase our costs.\nReal estate development is subject to state and federal environmental regulations and to possible interruption or termination because of environmental considerations, including, without limitation, air and water quality, and protection of endangered species and their habitats. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved and agency rulemaking and litigation are ongoing, the outcome of such rulemaking and litigation can be unpredictable, and at any time can result in unplanned or unforeseeable restrictions on or even the prohibition of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. Certain of our developments include habitats of endangered species. We have obtained the necessary permits from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to allow the development of our properties. However, future endangered species listings or habitat designations could impact development of our properties.\nUnder various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under or migrating through such properties, whether generated from our property or other property, including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for harm to natural resources. The costs of removal or remediation, and the impact on the development potential and development timeline could be substantial. These laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. Environmental laws provide for sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos and other airborne contaminants. In addition, third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could materially adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal, state or local agencies review land developers\u2019 compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs and result in project delays. We are making, and will continue to make, expenditures with respect to our real estate development for the protection of the environment. New environmental regulations or changes in existing regulations or their enforcement may be enacted and such new regulations or changes may require significant expenditures by us. The recent trend toward stricter standards in environmental legislation and regulations is likely to continue and could have a material adverse effect on our operating costs.\nFurther, regulatory and societal responses intended to reduce potential climate change impacts may increase our costs to develop, operate and maintain our properties, including but not limited to costs of building materials, energy and utility costs and insurance costs. If we are unable to adequately address such matters, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business.\nRisks Relating to Leasing Operations\nUnfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could negatively affect occupancy or rental rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations and ability to service our debt.\nIn 2021 and 2020, our leasing operations primarily involved the lease of retail space to tenants in a variety of businesses at retail and mixed-use properties that we developed, and the lease of residences in multi-family projects that we developed.\nThe average occupancy rates and rents at properties we develop and lease, particularly those that are newly constructed or have not stabilized, may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions, the development by competitors of competing retail or housing\nalternatives, or our inability to achieve stabilization of a property on schedule, any of which may result in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues.\nA decline in real estate market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy or rental rates, which could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations. The risks that could affect conditions in our markets include the following:\n\u2022Local conditions in the market, such as an oversupply of, or decrease in demand for, retail space or residential rental properties, or increased competition from other available retail buildings or multi-family complexes;\n\u2022The inability or unwillingness of tenants to pay their current rent or rent increases; and\n\u2022Declines in market rental rates.\nOur rental revenues may be lower as a result of lower average occupancy rates, increased turnover, reduced rental rates, increased concessions and potential increases in uncollectible rent. In addition, we continue to incur expenses such as maintenance costs, insurance costs and property taxes, whether or not a property is occupied. Further, we may experience increases in our operating expenses, some or all of which may be out of our control. We cannot predict with certainty whether any of these conditions will occur or whether, and to what extent, they will have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe may be unable to achieve and sustain satisfactory occupancy and rental rates at our retail and mixed use projects.\nWe face competition in attracting tenants to choose our retail and mixed-use projects over those of other developers and owners of similar properties. Once entered into, our retail leases typically range from five to ten years or longer. We may be unable to renew existing leases as they come due. Adverse market or economic conditions that negatively impact our tenants\u2019 businesses, particularly our anchor tenants, could adversely impact their ability to meet their obligations under the leases or to renew the leases. Additionally, the loss or failure to renew an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease or renew leases on the remainder of the affected properties. Our retail tenants face continual competition in attracting customers, often including from on-line competitors. If we are unable to lease our retail properties, collect rent payments from tenants or re-lease space on comparable or more favorable terms, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to service our debt obligations.\nWe may be unable to achieve and sustain satisfactory occupancy and rental rates at our multi-family properties.\nWe also face competition in attracting tenants to our multi-family projects, including from other multi-family properties as well as from condominiums and single-family homes available for rent or purchase. Once entered into, our multi-family leases are typically for a term of 12 months. As these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. Further, we may be unable to renew existing leases as they come due. Adverse economic conditions that negatively impact our tenants' employment could adversely impact our tenants' ability to pay rent and/or cause tenants and potential tenants to prefer housing alternatives with lower rents. In addition, economic developments that favor home ownership over renting, such as low or declining interest rates, favorable or improving mortgage terms or a strong or strengthening job market, could also have an adverse impact on the profitability of our multi-family properties.\nRisks Relating to our Discontinued Operations - W Austin Hotel\nAn adverse change in external perceptions of the W Austin Hotel could negatively affect the hotel\u2019s results of operations.\nOur W Austin Hotel is managed by W Hotel Management, Inc. a subsidiary of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Marriott International, Inc. The hotel\u2019s ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions and market recognition of the W hotel brand, of Starwood and Marriott as hotel operators and of the quality of the W Austin Hotel and its services. The reputation of the W Austin Hotel may be negatively affected if Marriott\u2019s or Starwood\u2019s reputations are damaged for any reason. In addition, we are required to spend money periodically to keep the property well maintained, modernized and refurbished in accordance with brand standards, which may be more costly than we anticipate.\nThe W Austin Hotel\u2019s revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if the W Austin Hotel is unable to compete effectively in the hotel industry in Austin.\nThe hotel industry in Austin is highly competitive. The W Austin Hotel competes for customers with other hotel and resort properties in Austin, ranging from national and international hotel brands to independent, local and regional hotel operators. We compete based on a number of factors, including quality and consistency of rooms, restaurant, bar and meeting facilities and services, attractiveness of location and price, and other amenities. Historically, the Austin market has had a limited number of high-end hotel accommodations. However, hotel capacity is being expanded by other hotel operators in Austin, including several properties in close proximity to the W Austin Hotel in downtown Austin. Furthermore, travelers can book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms. Increased internet bookings of alternatives to hotel rooms could have an adverse effect on our hotel's occupancy, average daily rate and revenue per available room.\nThe W Austin Hotel is subject to the business, financial and operating risks common to the hotel industry, any of which could reduce its revenues and profitability.\nBusiness, financial and operating risks common to the hotel industry include:\n\u2022Changes in desirability of the hotel\u2019s location in Austin as a travel destination;\n\u2022Decreases in the demand for hotel rooms and related lodging services in general, including a reduction in travel as a result of the spread of illnesses, pandemics or epidemics, such as COVID-19, alternatives to in-person meetings (including virtual meetings), increases in energy costs and other expenses affecting travel, decreased airline capacities and routes and the financial condition of the airline, automotive, and other transportation-related industries and its impact on travel;\n\u2022Over-building of hotels;\n\u2022Seasonal and cyclical volatility;\n\u2022Increases in fixed costs, including increases in commercial property taxes and insurance;\n\u2022Decreased corporate, governmental or convention travel-related spending;\n\u2022The quality of the services provided by the hotel and investments in the maintenance and improvement of the hotel;\n\u2022The costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations, including employment, health, safety and environmental laws;\n\u2022Information technology disruptions and cybersecurity breaches, including theft or fraudulent use of guest, employee, or company data and disruption of reservation systems; and\n\u2022Increases in operating costs including, but not limited to, energy, water, labor (including the effect of labor shortages, unionization and minimum wage increases), food, workers\u2019 compensation and health-care, insurance and unanticipated costs related to force majeure events and their consequences.\nAny of these factors could reduce our revenues, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nRisks Relating to our Discontinued Operations - Entertainment Businesses\nOur entertainment businesses face intense competition in the live music industry, and they may not be able to maintain or increase their revenue or profits.\nOur entertainment businesses compete in a highly competitive industry and may not be able to maintain or increase their revenue as a result of such competition. The live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers\u2019 discretionary spending, and our venues compete with other venues to book artists. Our entertainment businesses\u2019 competitors compete for key personnel who have relationships with popular music artists and that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours. These competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists. Our competitors may develop services, advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those our entertainment businesses provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than our entertainment businesses achieve.\nOther variables related to our entertainment businesses that could adversely affect their financial performance include:\n\u2022Changes in consumer preferences and decreased success in offering events that appeal to customers;\n\u2022Technological changes and innovations that may lead to a reduction in attendance at live events, a loss of ticket sales or lower ticket fees;\n\u2022General economic conditions, including inflation, which could cause our consumers to reduce discretionary spending;\n\u2022Unfavorable fluctuations in operating costs, which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers via ticket prices;\n\u2022Event, tour and artist cancellations;\n\u2022Interruptions in our computer, communications, information and ticketing systems and infrastructures and data loss or other breaches of our network security;\n\u2022Occurrence and threat of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, intentional or unintentional mass-casualty incidents such as active shooter incidents, public health concerns such as contagious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, weather conditions, natural disasters or similar events that may require us to cancel or reschedule an event; and\n\u2022Occurrence of personal injuries or accidents in connection with our live music events.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Shares of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is thinly traded; therefore, our stock price may fluctuate more than the stock market as a whole and it may be difficult to sell large numbers of our shares at prevailing trading prices.\nAs a result of the thin trading market for shares of our common stock, our stock price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or the stock prices of similar companies. Without a larger public float, shares of our common stock will be less liquid than the shares of common stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, it may be difficult for investors to sell the number of shares they desire at an acceptable price. Trading of a relatively small volume of shares of our common stock may have a greater effect on the trading price than would be the case if our public float were larger.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law contain anti-takeover provisions and our by-laws contain an exclusive forum provision.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors (Board). Refer to Exhibit 4.1 for further discussion of anti-takeover provisions and an exclusive forum provision in our charter documents and Delaware law.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when and if they are declared by our Board. Further, our Comerica Bank credit facility prohibits us from paying a dividend on our common stock without the bank\u2019s prior written consent. Although we declared a special cash dividend on our common stock in March 2017 after receiving written consent from Comerica Bank, we may not pay special cash dividends in the future. Comerica Bank\u2019s consent to the payment of a dividend in March 2017 is not indicative of the bank\u2019s willingness to consent to the payment of future dividends. Additionally, our Comerica Bank loan agreements contain a restrictive covenant limiting common stock repurchases to $1.0 million in the aggregate during the term of the agreements. Any repurchases of our common stock in excess of $1.0 million would require a waiver from Comerica Bank. The declaration of future dividends and share repurchases, which is subject to our Board's discretion and the restrictions under our Comerica Bank loan agreements, will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, projected compliance with covenants in our debt agreements, outlook and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.\nOur Board and management are engaged in a strategic planning process, and our business strategy may change as a result.\nIf completed, the pending sale of Block 21 would result in us receiving substantial cash proceeds and would eliminate our hotel and entertainment segments. In addition, in December 2021, we received substantial cash proceeds from the sale of The Santal, which were used to pay down the balance on our Comerica Bank revolving credit facility. Our Board and management are engaged in a strategic planning process, which includes consideration of the uses of proceeds from the sales and of our long-term business strategy. Potential uses of proceeds may include a combination of further deleveraging, returning cash to shareholders and reinvesting in our project pipeline. These factors may impact our business strategy, and we cannot provide any assurance that any changes to our strategy or anticipated uses of proceeds will result in benefits realized by us or our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 77790, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "STRS"}
