RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed, and have been harmed, by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. The trading price of our securities could decline, and has declined, due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nActual or Threatened Epidemics or Pandemics may Have an Adverse Effect on our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response to the pandemic have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business. Steps have been taken by various countries to advise citizens to avoid non-essential travel, to implement closures of non-essential operations, and to implement quarantines and lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus, which have had a dampening effect on the economy and global demand for travel. While the ongoing roll-out of vaccines across a number of countries is a promising milestone in global efforts to contain and eliminate COVID-19, a number of uncertainties remain, including whether any additional vaccines or vaccine booster shots will receive regulatory approval, the risk of differing interpretations and assessments by the scientific community during the peer review/publication process, widespread adoption of the vaccines by consumers, the availability of raw materials needed to manufacture vaccines in sufficient quantities, and challenges in the storage, distribution and administration of vaccines. Uncertainty remains as to when a sufficient number of individuals will be vaccinated, permitting travel restrictions to be lifted. New COVID-19 variants that have emerged in recent months have the potential to increase the lethality, have increased the spread of COVID-19, may reduce vaccine effectiveness, and may prolong the duration of the pandemic, materially negatively impacting our business performance, results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) issued a Framework for Conditional Sailing Order on October 30, 2020, which outlines a phased approach for gradually permitting cruise ship passenger operations in U.S. waters, subject to certain conditions and guidelines. The Conditional Sailing Order and related measures, such as technical guidelines, currently operate as nonbinding recommendations for cruise lines arriving in or departing from a port in Florida, which most Florida-porting ships have chosen to voluntarily follow. On October 25, 2021, the CDC announced a temporary extension to the Framework for Conditional Sailing Order through January 15, 2022, due to the continued spread of the Delta variant. Following the expiration of this extension, the CDC recommends that cruise ships operating in U.S. waters choose to participate in the CDC\u2019s COVID-19 Program for Cruise Ships. There can be no assurance as to when our cruise line partners will be able to receive conditional\nsailing certificates for additional ships or whether they can remain in compliance with the Conditional Sailing Order and their conditional sailing certificates, once obtained.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially adversely impacted our business, operations, results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity, and is expected to continue to materially adversely impact our business, operations, results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity, in fiscal year 2022 and possibly thereafter. We cannot presently estimate the extent to which the pandemic will impact our business, which will depend on a number of factors, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; the negative impact it has on global and regional economies and economic activity, including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending; its short and longer-term impact on the demand for travel, transient and group business, and levels of consumer confidence; our ability to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic, including limiting or banning travel and cruises; and how quickly economies, travel and cruise activity, and demand for our services recover after the pandemic subsides. The COVID-19 pandemic also presents a significant threat to our employees\u2019 well-being and morale, which has impacted employee productivity and may impact employee retention going forward.\nTo date we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of the ongoing suspension of cruise voyages, the Company has taken steps to reduce expenses, including to date repatriating our shipboard staff furloughing certain destination resort spa personnel, capital expenditures and operating expenses, deferring payment of dividends declared and the suspension of our dividend program. Such steps, and further changes we may make in the future to reduce costs, may negatively impact guest loyalty, customer preferences, or our ability to attract and retain employees, destination resort partners or investors, and our reputation and market share may suffer as a result. Notwithstanding the mitigating actions we have undertaken, the Company continues to incur significant ongoing expenses. We may also incur additional COVID-19 related costs if we are subject to greater hygiene-related protocols in our services that are mandated by government authorities or other international authorities. In addition, the industry as a whole may be subject to enhanced health and hygiene requirements in attempts to counteract future outbreaks, which requirements may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement.\nCOVID-19 has caused heightened volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets, and this may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks. Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 may have adverse negative impacts on restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to maintain minimum levels of liquidity and otherwise limit our flexibility in operating our business, including the significant portion of assets that are collateral under these agreements.\nAs a result of COVID-19, some credit agencies may downgrade our credit ratings in the future. If our credit ratings are downgraded in the future, or if general market conditions were to ascribe a higher risk to our credit rating levels, our industry, or our company, our access to capital and the cost of debt financing will be further negatively impacted. The interest rate we pay on our existing debt instruments is affected by our credit ratings. Accordingly, a downgrade may cause our cost of borrowing to further increase.\nWe Depend on Our Agreements with Cruise Lines and Destination Resort Health and Wellness Centers; if These Agreements Terminate, Our Business Would Be Harmed\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated from our cruise ship health and wellness operations, which have been adversely impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19. In light of the current market conditions and the other impacts caused by COVID-19, our cruise line and destination resort spa agreements may not be renewed after their expiration date on similar terms or at all. Any renewals may cause further reductions in our margins, as the amounts we pay to cruise lines and land-based venues may increase upon entering into renewals of agreements.\nIn addition, these agreements provide for termination by the cruise lines with limited or no advance notice under certain circumstances, including, among other things, the withdrawal of a ship from the cruise trade, the sale or lease of a ship or our failure to achieve specified passenger service standards. Due to the impact of COVID-19, six vessels on which we operated health and wellness centers have been taken out of service permanently by our cruise line partners, and 20 vessels on which we operated health and wellness centers prior to the COVID-19 pandemic have been sold to other cruise line operators, including operators we currently serve. We are engaged in discussions with these cruise line operators regarding agreements to continue operation of our health and wellness centers aboard these ships; however, there can be no assurance that we will execute satisfactory agreements in the future. Termination or nonrenewal of cruise line agreements, either upon completion of their terms or prior thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Some of our land-based destination resort health and wellness center agreements also provide for termination with limited advance notice under certain circumstances.\nAs a result of the consolidation of the cruise industry, the number of independent cruise lines has decreased in recent years, and this trend may continue. Also, some cruise lines have ceased operating and this may happen to other cruise lines in the future. As a result of these factors, a small number of cruise companies, all of which currently are our customers, dominate the cruise industry.\nWe Depend on the Cruise Industry and Their Risks Are Risks to Us\nThe cruise industry has never before experienced a complete cessation of its operations. The public concern over the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with a drop in demand for international travel and leisure, and restrictions on international travel and immigration, have adversely affected the demand for cruises. In addition, COVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause some cruise lines to declare bankruptcy or cause their lenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt, or foreclose on collateral. Such bankruptcies, accelerations or foreclosures could, in some cases, result in the termination of our agreements with certain of our cruise line partners and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows, which could negatively affect our results of operations. Cruise lines in bankruptcy may not have sufficient assets to pay us termination fees, other unpaid fees, or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements with us. Even if some cruise lines do not declare bankruptcy, they may be unable or unwilling to pay us amounts to which we are entitled on a timely basis or at all. Cruise lines compete for consumer disposable leisure time dollars with virtually all other vacation alternatives. Demand for cruises is dependent on the underlying economic strength of the countries from which cruise lines source their passengers. Economic changes such as unemployment, economic uncertainty, and the threat of a global recession reduce disposable income or consumer confidence in the countries from which our cruise line partners source their passengers and have affected the demand for vacations, including cruise vacations, which are discretionary purchases.\nDespite the general historic trend of growth in the volume of cruise passengers prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, the impacts related to COVID-19 may have a material adverse effect on the number of future cruise passengers once voyages resume. A future resurgence of COVID-19, or the outbreak of another pandemic, could cause a cessation of cruise operations again, even after voyages resume.\nAccording to CLIA, 51% of passengers in the global cruise industry were sourced from North America, our core market, from 2018 to 2020. Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, there was also a growing number of passengers sourced from outside North America in markets such as Western Europe, Asia, Australasia and South America. A significant portion of the cruise industry\u2019s growth is expected to come from expansion of markets outside of our core North American market. We believe that non-North American passengers spend less on our services and products than North American passengers.\nOur health and wellness centers on ships operating in the North American market are currently our best performing centers, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate the same revenue performance in non-North American markets. Additionally, our cruise line partners dictate the itineraries and geographies where their ships sail, and they may change itineraries to be less favorable to our revenue performance.\nOther recent trends are those of certain cruise lines reducing the number of cruises to certain long-standing destinations and replacing them with alternative exotic destinations, as well as extending the length of voyages. As the cruise industry continues to resume operations after its virtual cessation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such replacements and extensions could result in cruises producing lower revenues per voyage than produced in prior years, which may impact our revenues.\nAccidents and other incidents involving cruise ships can materially adversely affect the cruise industry, as well as our results of operations and financial condition. Among other things, accidents reduce our revenues and increase the costs of our maritime-related insurance. In addition, accidents can adversely affect consumer demand for cruise vacations.\nOther risks to the cruise industry include unscheduled withdrawals of ships from service, delays in new ship introductions, environmental violations by cruise lines, and restricted access of cruise ships to environmentally sensitive regions, hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions and increases in fuel costs. For example, in the past, hurricanes have caused the withdrawal of ships that we served from service for use in hurricane relief efforts, as well as the temporary closing of cruise ports and the destruction of facilities. A number of cruise ships have experienced outbreaks of illnesses such as norovirus, E.coli, measles and COVID-19 that have affected, at times, hundreds of passengers on a ship.\nSevere weather conditions, both at sea and at ports of embarkation, also could adversely affect the cruise industry. The cruise industry also relies to a significant extent on airlines to transport passengers to ports of embarkation. A drastic reduction in airline services, and travel and immigration related restrictions due to the impacts of COVID-19, have adversely affected us. In addition, any strikes or other disruptions of airline service, including those that could follow terrorist attacks or armed hostilities, could adversely affect the ability of cruise passengers or our shipboard staff to reach their ports of embarkation, or could cause cancellation of cruises.\nCruise ships have increasingly had, and are expected to continue to have, itineraries which provide for the ships to be in port during cruises. When cruise ships are in port, our revenues are adversely affected compared with our revenues when cruise ships are at sea.\nCruise ships periodically go into dry-dock for routine maintenance, repairs and refurbishment for periods ranging from one to three weeks. Cruise ships also may be taken out of service unexpectedly for non-routine maintenance and repairs as a result of damage from an accident or otherwise, such as the Oasis of the Seas and Carnival Horizon incidents in 2019 and 2021, respectively. A ship also may go out of service with respect to us if it is transferred to a cruise line we do not serve or if it is retired from service. While we\nattempt to plan appropriately for the scheduled removal from service of ships we serve, unexpected removals from service of ships we serve can hamper the efficient distribution of our shipboard personnel, in addition to causing unexpected reductions in our shipboard revenues.\nThe cruise lines\u2019 capacity has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow over the next few years as new ships are introduced. In order to utilize the new capacity, it is likely that the cruise industry will need to increase its share of the overall vacation market. In order to increase that market share, cruise lines may be required to offer discounted fares to prospective passengers, which would have the potentially adverse effects on us described above.\nWe Are Required to Make Minimum Payments under Our Agreements and May Face Increasing Payments to Cruise Lines and Owners of Our Destination Resort Health and Wellness Centers\nWe are obligated to make minimum annual payments to certain cruise lines and owners of our land-based venues regardless of the amount of revenues we receive from customers. We may also be required to make such minimum annual payments under any future agreements into which we enter. Accordingly, we could be obligated to pay more in minimum payments than the amount we collect from customers. As of December 31, 2021, these payments were required by four of the agreements for our destination resort health and wellness centers.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we guaranteed total minimum payments to owners of our land-based venues of approximately $2.9 million in the aggregate for 2022. Upon resumption of cruising and as we renew or enter into new agreements with cruise lines and land-based venues, we may experience increases in such required payments. As of December 31, 2021, there were no minimum payments guarantee amounts to cruise lines.\nWe Depend on the Continued Viability of the Ships and Destination Resort Health and Wellness Centers We Serve\nOur revenues from our shipboard guests and guests at our destination resort health and wellness centers can only be generated if the ships and land-based venues we serve are open for business and continue to operate. Historically, some smaller cruise lines we served have ceased operating for economic reasons. We cannot be assured of the continued viability of any of the land-based venues (including our ability to protect our investments in build-outs of health and wellness centers) or cruise lines that we serve, particularly in the event of recurrence of the more severe aspects of the economic slowdown experienced in certain prior years, which may occur due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other disruptions. To the extent that cruise lines or land-based venues we serve, or could potentially serve in the future, cease to operate all or a portion of their operations, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIncreased Costs Could Adversely Impact our Financial Results\nTo date we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs until COVID-19 is contained relating to transportation, including repatriation, of our staff and hygiene-related protocols in our services that are mandated by government authorities or other international authorities. In addition, we expect that the industry as a whole will be subject to enhanced health and hygiene requirements with respect to COVID-19 and to counteract future outbreaks, which requirements may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement across our global fleet cruise operations.\nThe currently existing restrictions on air travel and immigration due to the impacts of COVID-19, coupled with government mandated social-distancing norms, could increase transportation costs in the future. In addition to the adverse effects described above, periods of higher fuel costs in the future can adversely affect us directly. We depend on commercial airlines for the transportation of our shipboard employees to and from the ships we serve and, as a result, we pay for a relatively large number of flights for these employees each year. During times of higher fuel costs, such as those experienced in certain prior years, airfares, including those applicable to the transportation of our employees, have been increased by the airlines we have utilized. Additionally, increased fuel costs could also add to the costs of delivery of our products to the ships we serve and other destinations in the future. Higher fuel charges also increase the cost to consumers of transportation to cruise ship destination ports and to venues where we operate our destination resort health and wellness centers, and also increase the cost of utilities at our destination resort health and wellness centers. Periods of increasing fuel costs would likely cause these transportation costs to correspondingly increase. Extended periods of increased airfares could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in prices of other commodities utilized by us in our business could adversely affect us. For example, in certain prior years, as a result of increases in the cost of cotton, the cost to us of linens and uniforms utilized in our operations has increased. Our land-based health and wellness operations also have experienced an increase in the cost of electrical utilities. Increases in minimum wage obligations in jurisdictions where we employ personnel have also affected us directly and could adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition.\nWe Depend on Our Key Officers and Qualified Employees\nOur ability to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 and our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior executive officers, including Leonard Fluxman, our Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Lazarus, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. The unanticipated loss of the services of either of these persons or other key management personnel, due to illness, resignation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur future success after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides is dependent on our ability to recruit and retain personnel qualified to perform our services. Shipboard employees typically are employed pursuant to agreements with terms of nine months. Our land-based health and wellness employees generally are employed without contracts, on an at-will basis. Other providers of shipboard health and wellness services compete with us for shipboard personnel. We also compete with destination resort health and wellness centers and other employers for our shipboard and land-based health and wellness personnel. After the effects of COVID-19 are controlled, and after we resume our operations, we may not be able to assemble a sufficient number of employees possessing the requisite training and skills necessary to conduct our business. Our inability to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future to provide our services and products could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, due to the impacts of COVID-19, the immigration approval processes in the United States has experienced severe backlog and may in the future proceed at a slower pace than previously had been the case. Since many of our shipboard employees are not United States citizens, exacerbation of this trend of immigration restrictions caused by COVID-19 could adversely affect our ability to meet our shipboard staffing needs on a timely basis.\nAlmost all of our shipboard personnel come from jurisdictions outside the United States. Due to the restrictions on international travel and immigration caused by COVID-19, our ability to obtain non-United States shipboard employees in the future will be subject to regulations in certain countries from which we source a number of our employees and, in the case of one country, control by an employment company that acts on behalf of employees and potential employees from that country. In addition, in that country, we are required to deal with local employment companies to facilitate the hiring of employees. Our ability to obtain shipboard employees from those countries on economic terms that are acceptable to us may be hampered by our inability to enter into an acceptable agreement with the applicable local employment company.\nIn addition, the various jurisdictions where we operate our health and wellness centers have their own licensing or similar requirements applicable to our employees, which could affect our ability to open new health and wellness centers on a timely basis or adequately staff existing health and wellness centers. The ship we serve that is United States-based also is subject to United States labor law requirements that can result in delays in obtaining adequate staffing.\nPossible Adverse Changes in United States or Foreign Tax Laws or Changes in Our Business Could Increase Our Taxes\nBackground\nWe are a Bahamas international business company (\u201cIBC\u201d) that owns, among other entities, OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) Limited (formerly known as Steiner Transocean Limited) (\u201cOneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u201d), our principal subsidiary and a Bahamas IBC that conducts our shipboard operations, primarily outside United States waters (which constitutes most of our shipboard activities), and One Spa World LLC, a Florida limited liability company that performs administrative services in connection with our operations in exchange for fees from OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) and other subsidiaries.\nWe also own, directly or indirectly, the shares of additional subsidiaries organized in the United States, the United Kingdom and other taxable jurisdictions, as well as subsidiaries organized in jurisdictions that do not subject the subsidiaries to taxation.\nCurrently, we and our non-United States subsidiaries are not subject to Bahamas income tax or other (including United States federal) income tax, except as set forth below. Our United States subsidiaries are subject to United States federal income tax as a consolidated group at a regular corporate rate of 21%. Generally, any dividends paid by our United States holding company to its parent, are subject to a 30% United States withholding tax. Other than as described below, we believe that none of the income generated by our non-United States subsidiaries should be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and, accordingly, that such income should not be subject to United States federal income tax.\nA foreign corporation generally is subject to United States federal corporate income tax at a rate of 21% on its taxable income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (\u201ceffectively connected income\u201d or \u201cECI\u201d). A foreign corporation also can be subject to a branch profits tax of 30% imposed on \u201cdividend equivalent amounts\u201d of its after-tax earnings that are ECI.\nECI may include any type of income from sources within the United States (\u201cU.S.-source income\u201d), but only limited types of income from sources without the United States (\u201cforeign-source income\u201d). OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) has three types of income: income from the provision of health and wellness services, income from the sales of health and wellness products and income from\nleasing (at rates determined on an arm\u2019s length basis) our shipboard employees and space to a United States subsidiary that performs health and wellness services and sells health and wellness products while the ships are in United States waters and pays OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) the amounts referenced above (the \u201cU.S. Waters Activities\u201d).\nWe believe that most of OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s shipboard income should be treated as foreign-source income under the U.S. Treasury Department regulations for determining the source of such income (the \u201csource rule regulations\u201d). This belief is based on the following:\n\u2022\nall of the functions performed, resources employed and risks assumed in connection with the performance of the above-mentioned services and sales (other than OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s involvement in the U.S. Waters Activities) occur outside of the United States; and\n\u2022\nincome to OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) from the U.S. Waters Activities is ECI, and thus subject to United States income taxation, but constitutes a small percentage of OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s total income.\nTo the extent that our belief about the source of OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s shipboard income is correct, such income would not be ECI because such income is income of a character (compensation for services, gains on sales of certain property, and rental income from the lease of tangible property) that cannot be treated as ECI unless it is treated as U.S.-source income. However, OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s shipboard income generated while in port in The Bahamas is subject to the payment of a 10% VAT payable to the Bahamas Department of Inland Revenue.\nThe Risks to OneSpaWorld\nUnder United States Treasury Department regulations, as of January 1, 2007, all or a portion of OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s income for periods commencing on or after that date could be subject to United States federal income tax at a rate of up to 35% with respect to income earned prior to January 1, 2018 and 21% with respect to income earned thereafter:\n\u2022\nto the extent the income from OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s shipboard operations that OneSpaWorld believes are performed outside of United States territorial waters is considered by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to be attributable to functions performed, resources employed or risks assumed within the United States or its possessions or territorial waters;\n\u2022\nto the extent the income from OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s sale of health and wellness products for use, consumption, or disposition in international waters is considered by the IRS to be attributable to functions performed, resources employed or risks assumed within the United States, its possessions or territorial waters; or\n\u2022\nto the extent that passage of title or transfer of ownership of products sold by OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) for use, consumption or disposition outside international waters, takes place in the United States or a United States office materially participates in such sales.\nIf OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) were considered to be a controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d) for purposes of the source rule regulations, any of its shipboard income would be considered U.S.-source income and would be subject to United States federal income tax unless such income is attributable to functions performed, resources employed or risks assumed in a foreign country or countries.\nA foreign corporation is a CFC if more than 50% of (i) the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or (ii) the total value of the stock of such corporation is owned or considered as owned by \u201cUnited States shareholders\u201d (\u201cU.S. shareholders\u201d) on any day during the taxable year of such corporation. A \u201cU.S. Shareholder,\u201d generally, means a \u201cUnited States person\u201d (\u201cU.S. person\u201d) who owns directly, indirectly or constructively at least 10% of the voting power or value of the stock of a foreign corporation. A \u201cU.S. person\u201d is a citizen or resident of the United States, a domestic partnership, a domestic corporation, any domestic estate or a trust over which a United States court is able to exercise administrative supervision and over which one or more U.S. persons have authority to control all substantial decisions.\nUnder certain \u201cdownward attribution\u201d rules made applicable by a provision of Pub. L. No. 115-97, enacted December 22, 2017 (known as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (\u201cTCJA\u201d)), to determine the CFC status of a foreign corporate subsidiary of a foreign parent corporation that also has a U.S. subsidiary, the foreign subsidiary may in certain circumstances be treated as a CFC based solely on its brother-sister relationship to the U.S. subsidiary. However, on September 22, 2020, the Federal Register published an amendment to the source rule regulations (the \u201c2020 amendment\u201d), providing that for purposes of that regulation, the status of a foreign corporation as a CFC or not is determined without regard to the above-mentioned provision of the TCJA. The 2020 amendment applies to taxable years of foreign corporations ending on or after October 1, 2019. For taxable years of foreign corporations ending before October 1, 2019, a taxpayer may apply such provisions to the last taxable year of a foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, and each\nsubsequent taxable year of the foreign corporation, provided that the taxpayer and U.S. persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) to the taxpayer consistently apply such provisions with respect to all foreign corporations.\nAccordingly, solely for purposes of the source rule regulations, we believe that OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) should not be characterized as a CFC. This should allow us to treat most of our shipboard income, which is earned by a foreign corporation that would not be a CFC but for the TCJA provision referred to above, to be foreign source income to the same extent as income earned by a foreign corporation that is not a CFC.\nIf OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) is subject to United States federal income tax (at a rate of 21%) on its income that is ECI, it also would be subject to a branch profits tax of 30% on its annual dividend equivalent amount (a measure of its after-tax earnings that are considered to be withdrawn, from its United States business).\nCertain non-United States jurisdictions may also assert that OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s income is subject to their income tax.\nSome of our United Kingdom, Bahamas and United States subsidiaries provide goods and/or services to us and certain of our other subsidiaries. The United Kingdom or United States tax authorities may assert that some or all of these transactions do not contain arm\u2019s length terms. In that event, income or deductions could be reallocated among our subsidiaries in a manner that could increase the United Kingdom or United States tax on us. This reallocation also could result in the imposition of interest and penalties.\nWe cannot assure you that the tax laws on which we have relied to minimize our income taxes will remain unchanged in the future.\nOur land-based operations, the income from which is generally taxable, have significantly increased and we intend to consider land-based opportunities in the future (though we cannot assure you that we will be successful in finding appropriate opportunities). To the extent that we are able to effectively implement this strategy, the amount of our income that is subject to tax would increase.\nThe Success of Health and Wellness Centers Depends on the Hospitality Industry\nWe are dependent on the hospitality industry for the success of destination resort centers. The public concern over the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with a drop in demand for international travel and leisure, and restrictions on international travel and immigration have adversely affected the hospitality industry. To the extent that consumers do not choose to stay at venues where we operate health and wellness centers, over which we have no control, our business, operations, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe considerations described above regarding the effects of adverse economic conditions on the cruise industry apply similarly to the hospitality industry, including the destination resorts where we have operations. Periods of economic slowdown result in reduced destination resort occupancy rates and decreased spending by destination resort guests, including at the destination resorts where we operate health and wellness centers. The recurrence of challenging economic conditions, as well as instances of increased fuel costs, which have occurred in certain prior years, could result in lower destination resort occupancy, which would have a direct, adverse effect on the number of destination resort guests that purchase our health and wellness services and products at the venues in question. Accordingly, such lower occupancy rates at the destination resorts we serve could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe following are other risks related to the hospitality industry:\n\u2022\nchanges in the national, regional and local conditions (including major national or international terrorist attacks, armed hostilities, such as the recent invasion of Ukraine, or other significant adverse events, including an oversupply of hotel properties or a reduction in demand for hotel rooms);\n\u2022\nthe possible loss of funds expended for build-outs of health and wellness centers at venues that fail to open, underperform or close due to economic slowdowns or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe attractiveness of the venues to consumers and competition from comparable venues in terms of, among other things, accessibility and cost;\n\u2022\nthe outbreaks of illnesses, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, or the perceived risk of such outbreaks, in locations where we operate land-based health and wellness centers or locations from which guests of such wellness centers are sourced;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis and floods, which may be exacerbated due to climate change;\n\u2022\npossible labor unrest or changes in economics based on collective bargaining activities;\n\u2022\nchanges in ownership, maintenance or room rates of, or popular travel patterns and guest demographics at the venues we serve;\n\u2022\npossible conversion of guest rooms at hotels to condominium units and the decrease in health and wellness center usage that often accompanies such conversions, and the related risk that condominium hotels are less likely to be suitable venues for our health and wellness centers;\n\u2022\nreductions in destination resort occupancy during major renovations or as a result of damage or other causes;\n\u2022\nacquisition by destination resort chains of health and wellness service providers to create captive \u201cin-house\u201d brands and development by destination resort chains of their own proprietary health and wellness service providers, reducing the opportunity for third-party health and wellness providers like us; and\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of the airline industry, which, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in an elimination of, or reduction in, airline service to locations where we operate destination resort facilities, which has resulted and could continue to result in fewer guests at those venues.\nWe Compete with Passenger Activity Alternatives\nWe compete with passenger activity alternatives on cruise ships and with competing providers of services and products similar to our services and products seeking agreements with cruise lines. Casinos, bars and a variety of shops are found on almost all of the ships served by us. In addition, ships dock in ports which provide opportunities for additional shopping as well as other activities that compete with us for passenger attention and disposable income, and cruise ships are increasingly offering itineraries providing for greater numbers of port days. Cruise ships also typically offer swimming pools and other recreational facilities and activities, as well as musical and other entertainment, all without additional charge to the passengers. Certain cruise lines we serve and have formerly served have engaged the services of third parties or their own personnel for the operation of the health and wellness centers for all or some of their ships. Additional cruise lines could take similar actions in the future. In addition, there are certain other entities offering services in the cruise industry similar to those provided by us and we may not be able to serve new cruise ships that come into service and that are not covered by our cruise line agreements.\nMany of the land-based venues that we serve or may serve in the future offer recreational entertainment facilities and activities similar to those offered on cruise ships, often without additional charge to guests. A number of the hotels we serve also offer casino gambling. These activities and facilities compete with us for customer time and disposable income. Our destination resort health and wellness centers also compete with other health and wellness centers in their vicinities, as well as with other beauty, relaxation or other therapeutic alternatives. These include salons that offer these services at prices significantly lower than those charged by us. We believe, however, that the prices charged by us are appropriate for the quality of the experience we provide in our respective markets. In addition, we also compete, both for customers and for contracts with hotels, with health and wellness centers and beauty salons owned or operated by companies that have offered their destination resort health and wellness services longer than we have, some of which enjoy greater name recognition with customers and prospective customers than health and wellness centers operated by us. Also, a number of these health and wellness center operators may have greater resources than we do. Further, some hotel operators provide health and wellness services themselves. If we are unable to compete effectively in one or more areas of our operations, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Non-U.S. Operations and Hostilities\nThe cruise lines we serve operate in waters and call on ports throughout the world and our destination resort health and wellness centers are located in a variety of countries. Operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks, including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions, volatile local political conditions, potential changes in duties and taxes, including changing and/or uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations, required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising, vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreign-based companies, currency fluctuations, interest rate movements, difficulties in operating under local business environments, port quality and availability in certain regions, U.S. and global anti-bribery laws or regulations, imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings.\nOperating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal, regulatory and tax requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations. However, we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees, agents, representatives and other third parties with whom we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them. Failure by us, our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties, sanctions, damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a global operator, our business may also be impacted by changes in U.S. policy or priorities in areas such as trade, immigration and/or environmental or labor regulations, among others. Depending on the nature and scope of any such changes, they could impact our domestic and international business operations. Any such changes, and any international response to them, could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel and/or cross border transactions, impact our guest experience and/or increase our operating costs.\nThe waters and countries in which we operate include geographic regions that, from time to time, experience political and civil unrest and armed hostilities. Political unrest in areas where we operate health and wellness centers also has adversely affected our operations and continued political unrest in the Middle East has adversely affected the travel industry in that region. The threat of additional attacks and of armed hostilities internationally, such as the hostilities in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, or locally, may cause prospective travelers to cancel their plans, including plans for cruise or land-based venue vacations. Weaker cruise industry and land-based venue performance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreased Severe Weather, Including as A Result of Climate Change, Can Disrupt Our Operations\nOur operations may be impacted by adverse weather patterns or other natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fires, tornados, tsunamis, typhoons and volcanic eruptions. Most scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere that contribute to climate change could have significant physical effects on weather conditions, such as increased frequency and severity of hurricanes, storms, droughts, floods, and other climatic events. It is possible that cruises we serve could be forced to alter itineraries or cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or tours due to these or other factors. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods and typhoons, may not only cause disruption, alteration, or cancellation of cruises and closures of destination resort health and wellness centers but may also adversely impact commercial airline flights and other transport or prevent certain individuals from electing to utilize our offerings altogether. In addition, these extreme weather conditions could result in increased wave and wind activity, which would make it more challenging to sail and dock ships and could cause sea/motion sickness among guests and crew on the ships we serve. These events could have an adverse impact on the safety and satisfaction of cruising and could have an adverse impact on our net revenue yields and profitability. Additionally, these extreme weather conditions could impact our ability to provide our cruise products and services as well as to obtain insurance coverage for operations in such areas at reasonable rates.\nRisk of Early Termination of Land-Based Health and Wellness Center Agreements\nA number of our land-based health and wellness center agreements provide that landlords may terminate the agreement prior to its expiration date (provided, in some cases, that we receive certain compensation with respect to our build-out expenses and earnings lost as a result of such termination). While we always attempt to negotiate the best deal we can in this regard, we may not be able to successfully negotiate a termination fee in any of our future agreements or that any amounts we would receive in connection with such termination accurately reflects the economic value of the assets we would be leaving behind as a result of such termination. In addition, in the event of certain terminations of an agreement with a land-based venue, such as by the venue operator after our breach of an agreement, or as a result of the bankruptcy of a venue, even if we have a provision in our agreement providing for a termination payment, we could receive no compensation with respect to build-out expenditures we have incurred.\nWe also attempt to obtain terms in our land-based health and wellness center agreements that protect us in the event that the lessor\u2019s lender forecloses and takes over the property in question. However, we cannot always obtain such protective \u201cnon-disturbance\u201d terms. In the event that the lender to a land-based venue owner under an agreement where no such non-disturbance term is included forecloses on that property, our agreement could be terminated prior to the expiration of its term. In such case, in addition to the loss of income from that health and wellness center, we could lose the residual value of any investment we made to build out that facility.\nDelays in New Ship Introductions Could Slow Our Growth\nOur growth depends, in part, on our serving new cruise ships brought into service. A number of cruise lines we serve have experienced in the past and recently, and could experience in the future, delays in bringing new ships into service. In addition, there is a limited number of shipyards in the world capable of constructing large cruise ships in accordance with the standards of major cruise lines. This also may contribute to delays in new ship construction. Such delays could slow our growth and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in and Compliance with Laws and Regulations Relating to Environment, Health, Safety, Security, Data Privacy and Protection, Tax and Anti-Corruption Under Which We Operate May Lead to Litigation, Enforcement Actions, Fines, or Penalties\nWe are subject to numerous international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties, including social issues, health and safety (including related to the COVID-19 pandemic), security, data privacy and protection, and tax, among other matters. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, treaties and agreements has led and could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. COVID-19 will increase regulatory and partner requirements exposing us\nto risks and uncertainties in connection with our ability to develop strategies to enhance our health and safety protocols to adapt to the current pandemic environment\u2019s unique challenges once operations resume and to otherwise safely resume our operations when conditions allow. We will be required to coordinate and cooperate with the CDC, U.S. and other nation governments, and global public health authorities to take precautions to protect the health, safety and security of guests and shipboard personnel and implement certain precautions once operations resume in the future. New legislation, regulations or treaties, or changes thereto, could impact our operations and would likely subject us to increased compliance costs in the future. We could also be subject to litigation alleging non-compliance with the new legislation. In addition, training of crew may become more time consuming and may increase our operating costs due to increasing regulatory and other requirements.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances or vessel discharges, including ballast water and waste disposal, could materially adversely affect our business, profitability and financial condition. Some environmental groups have lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships. Various agencies and regulatory organizations have enacted or are considering new regulations or policies, such as stricter emission limits to reduce greenhouse gas effects, which could adversely impact the cruise industry.\nOur guest and employee relationships provide us with access to sensitive data. We are subject to laws and requirements related to the treatment and protection of such sensitive data. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we do not comply with data privacy and protection regulations. Various governments, agencies and regulatory organizations have enacted and are considering new regulations and implementation of rules for existing regulations. Additional requirements could negatively impact our ability to market cruises to consumers and increase our costs.\nWe are subject to the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect in May 2018 and imposes significant obligations to businesses that sell products or services to EU customers or otherwise control or process personal data of EU residents. Should we violate or not comply with the GDPR, or any other applicable laws or regulations, contractual requirements relating to data security and privacy, either intentionally or unintentionally, or through the acts of intermediaries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities.\nWe are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate. There can be no assurance that the outcome from these examinations will not adversely affect our profitability.\nAs budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate, increases in income or other taxes affecting our operations may be imposed. Some social activist groups have lobbied for more taxation on income generated by cruise companies. Certain groups have also generated negative publicity for us. In recent years, certain members of the U.S. Congress have proposed various forms of legislation that would result in higher taxation on income generated by cruise companies.\nOur global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, economic sanctions, and other laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions or limitations on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside the U.S. may also be affected by changes in economic sanctions, trade protection laws, policies, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we improperly sell goods or otherwise operate improperly in areas subject to economic sanctions such as Crimea, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria, or if we improperly engage in business transactions with persons subject to economic sanctions.\nThese various international laws and regulations could lead and have led to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in significant awards or settlements to plaintiffs and civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or profitability, even if the monetary damage is mitigated by our insurance coverage.\nAs a result of ship or other incidents, litigation claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations, including, without limitation, those arising from personal injury, loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding areas, may be asserted or brought against various parties, including us. The time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims, actions and investigations. We may also incur costs both in defending against any claims, actions and investigations and for any judgments, fines, or civil or criminal penalties if such claims, actions or investigations are adversely determined and not covered by our insurance policies.\nWe Could be Subject to Governmental Investigations or Penalties, Legal Proceedings, Litigation, and Class Actions Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic that Could Adversely Impact our Reputation, Financial Condition, and Results of Operations\nLegal proceedings or litigation against us related to the COVID-19 pandemic brought by our employees, customers, cruise line partners, resort partners, shareholders, creditors or others could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business, including damages payments, payments under settlement agreements and fines.\nDisagreements with our cruise line or destination resort partners could also result in litigation. The nature of our responsibilities under our agreements with cruise line and destination resort partners enforce the standards required for our brands and may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements, which may include disagreements over the need for payments, reimbursements and other costs. Such disagreements may be more likely during difficult business environments, such as the one we have seen in recent months due to the adverse impacts of COVID-19. We seek to resolve any disagreements to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential cruise line and destination resort partners, but we cannot provide assurance that we can always do so. Failure to resolve such disagreements may result in litigation in the future. If any such litigation results in an adverse judgment, settlement, or court order, we could suffer significant losses, our profits could be reduced, or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained.\nWhile payments under some claims and lawsuits, or settlements of claims and lawsuits, may be covered by insurance such that the maximum amount of our liability, net of any insurance recoverable, could be typically limited to our self-insurance retention levels, the position that insurance companies will take with respect to claims related to COVID-19 is uncertain.\nProduct Liability and Other Potential Claims Could Adversely Affect Us\nThe nature and use of our products and services could give rise to liability if a customer were injured while receiving one of our services. Guests at our health and wellness centers could be injured, among other things, in connection with their use of our fitness equipment, sauna facilities or other facilities. If any of these events occurred, we could incur substantial litigation expense and be required to make payments in connection with settlements of claims or as a result of judgments against us.\nWe maintain insurance to cover a number of risks associated with our business. While we seek to obtain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates, we cannot be certain that appropriate insurance will be available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our insurance policies are subject to coverage limit, exclusions and deductible levels and are subject to non-renewal upon termination at the option of the applicable insurance company. Our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates for the potential liabilities that we face could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in connection with insured claims, we bear the risks associated with the fact that insurers often control decisions relating to pre-trial settlement of claims and other significant aspects of claims and their decisions may prove to not be in our best interest in all cases.\nWe believe that our current coverage is adequate to protect us against most of the significant risks involved in the conduct of our business, but we self-insure or use higher deductibles for various risks. Accordingly, we are not protected against all risks (including failures by third-party service providers such as insurance brokers to fulfill their duties), which could result in unexpected increases in our expenses in the event of certain claims against us.\nIf the types of services we offer increase, the potential for claims against us also could increase. We self-insure potential claims regarding certain of our medi-spa services. High visibility claims also could cause us to receive adverse publicity and suffer a loss of sales, and, therefore, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in such cases. We are, and may in the future be, subject to other legal proceedings, including claims presented as class actions. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters. It is reasonably possible that the final resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Indebtedness Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Ability to Operate and We May Incur Additional Debt\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have $234.5 million of secured indebtedness under our First Lien Term Loan Facility and Second Lien Term Loan Facility, and our First Lien Revolving Facility (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). Our debt level and the terms of our financing arrangements could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to successfully implement our growth strategies. In addition, under the Credit Facilities, certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries have granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of their assets. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by the other risk factors described herein. If we do not generate enough cash flow to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell our assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nThe Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\nOur Credit Facilities Contain Financial and Other Covenants. The Failure to Comply with Such Covenants Could Have An Adverse Effect on Us\nOur Credit Facilities contain certain financial covenants and a number of traditional negative covenants, including limitations on our ability to, among other things, incur and/or undertake asset sales and other dispositions, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions, and investments, consolidations, mergers, reorganizations and other fundamental changes, payment of dividends and other distributions to equity and warrant holders and prepayments of material subordinated debt, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the Credit Facilities, including any failure to comply with certain financial covenants due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on our revenue and results of operations, may result in an event of default under the agreements. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Facilities are entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Credit Facilities and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor, subject to customary intercreditor provisions among the first and second lien secured parties.\nOur First and Second Lien Term Facilities Are Tied to LIBOR\nThe London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. Our current portfolio of debt and financial instruments currently tied to LIBOR consists of the Company\u2019s First and Second Lien Term Facilities. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist, or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or if replacement conventions will be developed. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. Dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is observed and backward-looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. At this time, due to a lack of consensus as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on our liquidity. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate certain of our financing agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. As of December 31, 2021, we had $234.5 million in outstanding indebtedness tied to LIBOR.\nWe Restated Our Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 (Successor), and the Period from March 20, 2019 to December 31, 2019 (Successor), Which May Lead to Additional Risks and Uncertainties, Including Loss of Investor Confidence and Negative Impacts on Our Share Price\nOn April 12, 2021, the SEC staff issued a public statement entitled \u201cStaff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (\u201cSPACs\u201d)\u201d (the \u201cStatement\u201d). On May 10, 2021, we amended our 2020 Form 10-K to restate previously issued consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Successor), and the Period from March 20, 2019 to December 31, 2019 (Successor) (the \u201cAffected Periods\u201d). The restatement related to accounting for warrants incorrectly as components of equity as opposed to liabilities. The restatement of the financial statements (the \u201cRestatement\u201d) had no impact on our liquidity, cash, cash equivalents, or adjusted EBITDA for the Affected Periods. We expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses due to the quarterly fair valuation of our Warrants and that such gains or losses could be material.\nAs a result of the foregoing matters, we may become subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including, among others, unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees, the increased possibility of legal proceedings, shareholder lawsuits, governmental agency investigations, and inquiries by the Nasdaq Capital Market or other regulatory bodies, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could subject our Company to civil or criminal penalties, shareholder class actions or derivative actions. We could face monetary judgments, penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause our share price to decline. If any such actions occur, they may consume a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. If we do not prevail in any such proceedings, we could be required to pay damages or settlement costs. In addition, the Restatement and related matters could impair our reputation. Each of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nWe Identified a Material Weakness in our Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2020; if we are Unable to Establish and Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting in the Future, we may not be able to Accurately Report our Financial Results, or do so in a Timely Manner, Which may Adversely Affect Investor Confidence in us and Materially Adversely Affect our Business and Operating Results.\nFollowing the issuance of the SEC\u2019s Statement, on April 30, 2021, our management and our audit committee concluded that, in light of the Statement, it was appropriate to restate our previously issued audited financial statements for the Affected Periods. See \u201c-We Restated Our Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 (Successor), and the Period from March 20, 2019 to December 31, 2019 (Successor), Which May Lead to Additional Risks and Uncertainties, Including Loss of Investor Confidence and Negative Impacts on Our Share Price.\u201d As part of such process, our management and audit committee determined that our disclosure controls and procedures for the Affected Periods were not effective with respect to the classification of our Warrants as components of equity as opposed to liabilities, and that the foregoing arose as a result of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. As of the date of the filing of this report, we have completed our remediation plan for the material weakness we identified in relation to the Restatement of our financial statements for the Affected Periods. While management believes that the remedial efforts have resolved the identified material weakness, there is no assurance that such remedial efforts will ultimately have the intended effects or that additional remedial actions will not be necessary.\nIf we identify any new material weakness in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding accurate and timely filing of periodic reports and with applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. Additionally, as a result of the material weakness we identified in our internal controls over financial reporting for the Affected Periods, the Restatement, the change in the accounting treatment of our Warrants, as well as other matters raised or that may in the future be raised by the SEC, we may in the future be exposed to litigation or other disputes concerning, among others, claims invoking the federal and state securities laws, contractual claims or other claims arising from the Restatement and the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements. Any such litigation or dispute, regardless of its outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nIf We Are Unable to Execute Our Growth Strategies, Including Our Ability to Offer and Integrate New Services and Products, Our Business Could Be Adversely Affected\nThe demands of consumers with respect to health and wellness services and products continue to evolve. Among other things, there is a continuing trend to add services at health and wellness centers similar to those traditionally provided in medical facilities, including services relating to skin care. If we are unable to identify and capture new audiences, our ability to successfully integrate additional services and products will be adversely affected. Our ability to provide certain additional services depends on our ability to find appropriate third parties with whom to work in connection with these services and, in certain cases, could be dependent on our ability to fund substantial costs. We cannot assure that we will be able to find such appropriate third parties or be able to fund such costs. We also cannot assure that we will be able to continue to expand our health and wellness services sufficiently to keep up with consumer demand. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategies or continue to maintain sales at our current rate, or at all. If we fail to implement our growth strategies, our revenue and profitability may be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Business Could Be Adversely Affected if We Are Unable to Successfully Protect Our Trademarks or Obtain New Trademarks\nThe market for our services and products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our brand names. Although we take appropriate steps to protect our brand names, in the future, we may not be successful in asserting trademark protection in connection with our efforts to grow our business or otherwise due to the nature of certain of our marks or for other reasons. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial. If other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our brands in the marketplace may be diluted. In addition, any infringement of our intellectual property rights would likely result in a commitment of our time and resources to protect these rights through litigation or otherwise. One or more adverse judgments with respect to these intellectual property rights could negatively impact our ability to compete and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Are Subject to Currency Risk\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. Dollar can impact our results of operations, most significantly because we pay for the administration of recruitment and training of our shipboard personnel in U.K. Pounds Sterling and Euros. Accordingly, while the relative strength of the U.S. Dollar has improved recently, renewed weakness of the U.S. Dollar against those currencies can adversely affect our results of operations, as has occurred in some recent years. To the extent that the U.K. Pound Sterling or the Euro is stronger than the U.S. Dollar, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe May Be Exposed to the Threat of Cyber Attacks and/or Data Breaches, which Could Cause Business Disruptions and Loss\nCyberattacks can vary in scope and intent from economically driven attacks to malicious attacks targeting our key operating systems with the intent to disrupt, disable or otherwise cripple our maritime and/or land-based operations. This can include any combination of phishing attacks, malware and/or viruses targeted at our key systems. The breadth and scope of this threat has grown over time, and the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks, as well as the sources and targets of the attacks, change frequently. While we invest time, effort and capital resources to secure our key systems and networks, we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all such attacks.\nA successful cyberattack may target us directly, or may be the result of a third-party vendor\u2019s inadequate care. In either scenario, we may suffer damage to our key systems and/or data that could interrupt our operations, adversely impact our reputation and brand and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation, litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in systems technology, personnel, monitoring and other investments.\nEven if we are fully compliant with legal and/or industry standards and any relevant contractual requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data and/or critical systems. Any breach, theft, loss, or fraudulent use of guest, employee, third-party or company data, could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers, and expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, governmental investigation, litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. Further, if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\nChanges in Privacy Law Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Market Our Services Effectively\nOur ability to market our services effectively is an important component of our business. We rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email marketing, and direct mail. Any further restrictions under laws such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, the GDPR, and various United States state laws or new federal laws regarding marketing and solicitation, or international data protection laws that govern these activities, could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing, email, and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy. If this were to occur, we may be unable to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could impact our ability to effectively market and sell our services.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nSteiner Leisure Owns a Significant Portion of Our Shares and Has Representation on Our Board; Steiner Leisure May Have Interests That Differ from Those of Other Shareholders\nAs of the date of this report, approximately 21% of our common shares are beneficially owned by Steiner Leisure. Two of our directors were nominated by Steiner Leisure, and as a result, Steiner Leisure may be able to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted for director action, subject to our directors\u2019 obligation to act in the interest of all of our shareholders, and for shareholder action, including the designation and appointment of the OneSpaWorld Board of Directors (and committees thereof) and approval of significant corporate transactions, including business combinations, consolidations and mergers. The influence of Steiner Leisure over our management could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which could cause the market price of our common shares to decline or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for our common shares.\nUnder the \u201cBusiness Opportunities\u201d section of our Third Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association and Second Amended and Restated Articles of Association (our \u201cArticles\u201d), among other things, we have renounced any interest or expectancy of us or our subsidiaries being offered an opportunity to participate in any potential transaction opportunities available to Steiner Leisure and certain of its affiliates and related parties, such parties have no obligation to communicate or offer such potential transaction opportunities to us, and such parties will have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar businesses as us. Prospective investors in our common shares should consider that the interests of Steiner Leisure may differ from their interests in material respects.\nIf We Fail to Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, We May Not Be Able to Accurately Report Our Financial Results or Prevent Fraud; as a Result, Shareholders Could Lose Confidence in Our Financial and Other Public Reporting, Which Is Likely to Negatively Affect Our Business and the Market Price of Our Common Shares\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in our implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing conducted by us, or any testing conducted by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which is likely to negatively affect our business and the market price of our shares.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years following the date we became a public company, until 2024. In the event we satisfy certain requirements, including, without limitation, qualifying as a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d due the aggregate market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates exceeding $700 million, our independent registered public accounting firm would be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nThe Market Price and Trading Volume of Our Common Shares Has Been and May Continue to Be Volatile\nThe market price and trading volume of our common shares may be volatile and could decline significantly, as has recently happened as a result of COVID-19 and related economic uncertainty. We cannot assure that the market price of our common shares will not fluctuate widely or decline significantly in the future in response to a number of factors, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\nthe continuation and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe realization of any of the risk factors presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated differences in our estimates, or in the estimates of analysts, for our revenues, results of operations, level of indebtedness, liquidity or financial condition;\n\u2022\nperformance and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances, sales or resales, or anticipated issuances, sales or resales, of our common shares, such as additional sales of common shares through the Company\u2019s ATM Program;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us, the cruise industry, or the hospitality industry generally;\n\u2022\nthe performance and market valuations of our cruise line partners and of companies in the travel leisure industry;\n\u2022\nbroad disruptions in the financial markets, as have occurred as a result of COVID-19, including sudden disruptions in the credit markets;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community with respect to the factors impacting our business, including the risk factors presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K;\n\u2022\nactual, potential or perceived operational and internal control, accounting or financial reporting issues; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles, policies and guidelines.\nIn the past, securities class-action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their shares. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, materially adversely impacting our business, operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIf Securities or Industry Analysts Do Not Publish Research, Publish Inaccurate or Unfavorable Research or Cease Publishing Research About Us, Our Share Price and Trading Volume Could Decline Significantly\nThe market for our common shares will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade their opinions about our business or our common shares, publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, or cease publishing about us regularly, demand for our common shares could decrease, which might cause our share price and trading volume to decline significantly.\nFuture Issuances of Debt Securities and/or Equity Securities May Adversely Affect Us, Including the Market Price of Our Common Shares, and May Be Dilutive to Our Existing Shareholders\nIn the future, we may incur debt and/or issue equity ranking senior to our common shares. Those securities will generally have priority upon liquidation. Such securities also may be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common shares. Because our decision to issue debt and/or equity in the future will depend, in part, on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts. As a result, future capital raising efforts may reduce the market price of our common shares and be dilutive to our existing shareholders.\nYou May Have Difficulty Enforcing Judgments Against Us\nWe are an international business company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. A substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible to:\n\u2022\neffect service of process within the United States upon us; or\n\u2022\nenforce, against us, court judgments obtained in U.S. courts, including judgments relating to U.S. federal securities laws.\nIt is unlikely that Bahamian courts would entertain original actions against Bahamian companies, their directors or officers predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. The Bahamian courts may apply any rule of Bahamian law which is mandatory irrespective of the governing law and may refuse to apply a rule of such governing law of the relevant documents, if it is manifestly incompatible with the public policy of The Bahamas. Furthermore, judgments based upon any civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws are not directly enforceable in The Bahamas. Rather, a lawsuit must be brought in The Bahamas on any such judgment. The courts of The Bahamas would recognize a U.S. judgment as a valid judgment, and permit the same to provide the basis of a fresh action in The Bahamas and should give a judgment based thereon without there being a re-trial or reconsideration of the merits of the case provided that (i) the courts in the United States had proper jurisdiction under Bahamian conflict of law rules over the parties subject to such judgment, (ii) the judgment is for a debt or definite sum of money other than a sum payable in respect of taxes or charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or penalty, (iii) the U.S. courts did not contravene the rules of natural justice of The Bahamas, (iv) the judgment was not obtained by fraud on the part of the party in whose favor the judgment was given or of the court pronouncing it, (v) the enforcement of such judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of The Bahamas, (vi) the correct procedures under the laws of The Bahamas are duly complied with, (vii) the judgment is not inconsistent with a prior Bahamian judgment in respect of the same matter and (viii) enforcement proceedings are instituted within six years after the date of such judgment.\nCertain Provisions in Our Articles May Limit Shareholders\u2019 Ability to Affect a Change in Management or Control\nOur Articles include certain provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a future takeover or change in control of us that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. Among other things, our Articles provide for a classified Board serving staggered terms of three years, super majority voting requirements with respect to certain significant transactions and restrictions on the acquisition of greater than 9.99% ownership without our Board\u2019s approval. Our equity plans and our officers\u2019 employment agreements provide certain rights to plan participants and those officers, respectively, in the event of a change in control of us. Additionally, with the 2020 Private Placement and the related Investment Agreement, our Articles were amended to create a new class of non-voting common shares (the \u201cNon-Voting Common Shares\u201d). The Non-Voting Common shares will automatically be converted into Voting Common Shares upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the Articles. Each Non-Voting Common Share will automatically convert into one Voting Common Share, upon the occurrence of a Qualified Transfer of such Non-Voting Common Share or with the prior consent of our Board of Directors. A \u201cQualified Transfer\u201d means a transfer (x) to a third party that is not (1) an affiliate of such holder nor (2) a person whose ownership thereof would result in such shares being treated as constructively owned by such holder under Section 958(b) of the U.S. Tax Code, applicable Treasury Regulations and other official guidance (a Person described in this clause (x), an \u201cUnrelated Person\u201d), and (y) that is not otherwise prohibited under the Articles. This may dilute the voting power of the current common shareholders. In addition to the Non-Voting Shares, we have issued deferred shares and warrants as more fully described elsewhere in this report. These deferred shares and warrants may further reduce the control and voting power of a common shareholder.", "PERMNO": 17114, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "OSW"}
