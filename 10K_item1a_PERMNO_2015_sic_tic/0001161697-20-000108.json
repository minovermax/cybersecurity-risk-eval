RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves significant risks. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider all of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC including the material risks and uncertainties that we have identified below. The risks and uncertainties identified below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. If any of the material risks or uncertainties that we face were to occur, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Please note that additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business, operations, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in our highly competitive industry.\nWe are a global company that faces competition from a wide range of international and domestic companies, including those that deliver electronic volumetric pumps, elastomeric infuser pumps and other mechanical devices. These include large medical device companies with multiple product lines, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We also face competition from companies that are even more specialized than ours with respect to particular markets or product lines. Some of those companies have greater financial and sales and marketing resources than we do or offer products at a lower price point than ours. In addition, former employees may develop products that are competitive with ours or capitalize on customer relationships developed while employed with us, subject to their continuing obligations under confidentiality agreements and other restrictive covenants that may survive their employment. We face competition on the basis of product features, clinical or economic outcomes, product quality, availability, price, services, technological innovation and other factors. In addition, we face changing customer preferences and requirements, changes in the ways health care services are delivered, including the transition of high-acuity care to lower-acuity, and non-acute care settings. Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could suffer.\nThe medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in larger companies with greater access to markets. Health care systems, other health care companies and even retail pharmacies are also consolidating, resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies. As a result, competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased. Group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers. Further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the prices of our products.\nConsolidation in the medical industry could have a negative impact with payor and provider relationships and distributor relationships, as we could lose market share as consolidation occurs.\nTechnological developments by others may disrupt our business and negatively impact our revenues.\nThe medical device industry is subject to rapid technological change and discovery and frequent product introductions. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies that provide better features, pricing or clinical outcomes or economic value may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements, our products may not be marketable. If competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization for new products than we do, our operations will likely be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by investing in innovation and new product development, which will require substantial resources. Our successful product development will depend on many factors, including our ability to attract strong talent to lead our research and development efforts, properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory concurrence on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economical and timely manner, obtain appropriate\n- 7 -\nintellectual property protection for our products, gain and maintain market acceptance of our products, and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. In addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory concurrence or gain market acceptance. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer.\nProposed changes to the FDA 510(k) clearance pathway and post-market safety monitoring process could adversely affect our ability to offer our new and existing products.\nThe FDA has announced its intention to pursue comprehensive reforms to its current 510(k) clearance pathway, which is used for clearance of low- to moderate-risk devices that are substantially equivalent to a device already on the market, and to its post-market safety monitoring process. The proposals, among other things, could prevent the use of certain older predicate devices as support for 510(k) clearance, provide for a \u201cde novo\u201d classification process to permit an evaluation of novel devices without a predicate device, establish an alternative 510(k) pathway for \u201cwell-understood\u201d devices relying on objective safety and performance criteria, and expand post-market safety surveillance measures. These reforms could delay or prevent us from obtaining or maintaining 510(k) clearances or other premarket authorizations for our existing or new devices. Compliance with the new rules could require us to undertake significant additional costs prior to and following commercialization of our products, which may reduce the profitability of those products.\nWe are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur medical devices and technologies, as well as our business activities, are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, including by the U.S. Department of Justice, Health and Human Services-Office of the Inspector General, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products, and the failure to maintain approvals or clearances, or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance, it may:\n\u2022\ntake a significant amount of time\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources\n\u2022\ninvolve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance\n\u2022\ninvolve modifications, repairs, or replacements of our products, and\n\u2022\nlimit the proposed uses of our products.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the FDA and other applicable non-U.S. government agency regulations. For instance, all medical devices marketed in the U.S. must be manufactured in accordance with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations. Accordingly, our facility and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with applicable regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on the FDA\u2019s Form 483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. Additionally, as a manufacturer of medical devices, we are subject to annual registration and listing requirements, and associated user fees. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with any applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could deem our products adulterated or misbranded, and take enforcement action against us. Possible enforcement actions include, but are not limited to: banning such medical products; detaining or seizing all adulterated or misbranded medical products; ordering recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products; refusing to grant pending pre-market approval or 510(k) clearance applications; and/or requiring us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations.\nIn addition, the FDA has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling, and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.\n- 8 -\nRegulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business; however, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGovernmental regulations outside the U.S. have, and may continue to, become increasingly stringent and common. In the European Union, for example, a new Medical Device Regulation was published in 2017 which, when it enters into full force in 2020, will include significant additional premarket and post-market requirements. Penalties for regulatory non-compliance could be severe, including fines and revocation or suspension of a company\u2019s EU business license, mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions. Future foreign governmental laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us.\nHealth care policy changes and industry cost-containment measures could result in downward pricing pressure for our products and limit our sales.\nMost of our customers, and those to whom our customers supply medical devices, rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the medical devices we manufacture. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs and, more generally, to reform the health care system, could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products or the drugs that they administer, which would put pressure on us to reduce our prices for our products and/or limit our sales. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business depends on an adequate supply of drugs to be administered by our products.\nDemand for our products depends on the availability of drugs to be administered by them. Currently, most of our products require immunoglobulin therapies that rely on blood plasma collection for drugs such as Hizentra\u00ae and Cuvitru\u00ae. Any disruption in the supply of these drugs for any reason, including contamination, could significantly adversely affect our business. The change of any drug indication by the FDA or comparable foreign governmental agencies could also result in decreased demand for our products. In addition, pharmaceutical companies and other competitors have or are developing alternative therapies for disease states that are deliverable without a medical device. If there is not an adequate supply of drugs requiring administration by medical devices such as those provided by us or alternative therapies are developed, our sales may suffer and/or our products may become obsolete.\nIssues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions, cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.\nQuality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products.\nDefects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or outcome, could not only result in significant legal defense costs, but also have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and ability to attract and retain customers for our products. In some circumstances, adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements.\n- 9 -\nInterruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income.\nThere is a strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations, which includes product assembly, calibration, pre- and post-assembly quality control inspection and testing, and final packaging for all of our products at our Chester, NY facility. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue that could result in a recall or other inability to sell our products.\nOur products are manufactured and stored at a single manufacturing facility in Chester, NY. Loss or damage to our manufacturing and storage site due to weather, vandalism, terrorism, a natural disaster, issues in our manufacturing process, equipment failure or other factors, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences, including damage to our relationship with customers. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.\nWe take precautions to safeguard our facility and storage site, including acquiring insurance, adopting health and safety protocols and utilizing off-site storage of computer data. Our insurance may not cover our losses in any particular case. In addition, regardless of the level of insurance coverage, damage to our facilities may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may need to substantially change our manufacturing operations in order to expand.\nWe currently have six options to extend our current lease of our manufacturing facility, which is also our headquarters, through August 2022. Although we believe our current space is sufficient to significantly increase current production requirements, we are considering various alternatives to expand our manufacturing operations and carry out our business plan. There is no guaranty that any of these alternatives will be realized on favorable terms, or at all. If we do find an appropriate alternative, we may need to expend significant resources to ensure continued regulatory compliance. Changes to our corporate headquarters and/or manufacturing operations could cause us to incur significant expenses and could delay or reduce our ability to manufacture our products for some time. Our financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any such change.\nWe are subject to lawsuits.\nWe are currently party to several lawsuits with a competitor. In the future we may be party to lawsuits, settlement discussions, mediations, arbitrations and other disputes, including patent and product liability claims, whether brought by companies, individuals or governmental authorities. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time, attention and resources. Our insurance coverage may not provide adequate protection against actual losses. In addition, we are subject to the risk that one or more of our insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. Even if we maintain adequate insurance, claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on our ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future. Litigation and other disputes, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees.\nThe outcome of pending EMED legal proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nWe are involved in several lawsuits with our competitor, EMED Technologies Corporation (\u201cEMED\u201d), wherein EMED has alleged our needle sets infringe various patents controlled by EMED. Certain of these lawsuits also allege antitrust violations, unfair business practices and various other claims. Although we believe we will prevail on the merits, an adverse outcome in this matter could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\u201d for a further description of this litigation.\nIf we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.\nPatent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We own patents, trade secrets, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of our products. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents, both in the U.S. and in other countries. We can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. Additionally, our intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed\n- 10 -\nupon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or we may be unable to enter into license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations.\nThe patent position of a medical device company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.\nAlthough our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies in the event of a breach of confidence. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nFurthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property, confidential information and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMisappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.\nWe need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees, including people in technical, marketing, sales, research and quality assurance and regulatory compliance positions. We depend on key management personnel and attracting and retaining other qualified personnel, and our business could be harmed if we lose key management personnel or cannot attract and retain other qualified personnel. We do not maintain any \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of any of our employees.\nIn addition, if we expect to grow our operations, it will be necessary for us to attract and retain additional qualified personnel. In particular, we will need to find experienced key employees to lead our research and development and quality assurance and regulatory compliance functions. The failure to attract, integrate, motivate, and retain additional skilled and qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. We compete for such personnel against numerous companies, including larger, more established companies with significantly greater financial resources than we possess. Our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location and work environment. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell a majority of our products through only a few distributors.\nMost of our customers prefer to purchase our products through distributors, rather than directly from us, because of \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d convenience and their ability to ship directly to patients. We sell most of our products through a small number of distributors, two in and two outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2019, these four distributors comprised approximately 67% of our net revenues. Any decline in business with the distributors outside the U.S. could have an adverse impact on our business. If we were unable to sell through the distributors outside the U.S., we would have to find other distributors or broaden our customer base and expand direct relationships with customers. Other distributors may not be available or may not agree to arrangements that are commercially reasonable. In the U.S. we could transition to direct customer purchase; however, customers may not want to purchase directly from us and may decide to purchase competitors\u2019 products through their distributors. Moreover, a transition from distributors to direct customer purchase would be time consuming and costly.\n- 11 -\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price, or if we experience other supply difficulties, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of raw materials and components for our products. All of the materials and components that go into the manufacturing of our products are sourced from third-party suppliers.\nThe price and supply of materials and components for our products may be impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control. While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any supply disruption, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient or effective. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of raw materials and components and an inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply, could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nSome of the components for our products are provided by a single supplier, including our Taiwan-based supplier of molded plastic parts and our U.S.-based supplier of tubing. We also rely on a single supplier to provide subassemblies for our products. We do not have long-term agreements in place with these suppliers, although we are in the process of negotiating such agreements with certain of our suppliers. We are also in the process of seeking alternative sources of supply for our products. Due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers, however, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost.\nAdditionally, volatility in our cost of energy, raw materials, components, subassemblies, transportation/freight, and manufacturing and distribution could adversely affect our results of operations. Climate change (including laws or regulations passed in response to it) could increase our costs, in particular our costs of supply, energy and transportation/freight. Material or sustained increases in the price of oil could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials we use to make and package our products, as well as our transportation/freight costs. These outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price).\nOur failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of health care products may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur devices are purchased principally by specialty pharmacies and ambulatory service providers or hospitals that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of those customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement from third-party payers for our products and the drugs they administer is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, our devices are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by U.S. governmental agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and health care fraud. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs, and in some cases to all payers. In certain circumstances, insurance companies can attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. In addition, as a manufacturer of FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties. Similar reporting requirements applicable to medical device manufacturers have also been implemented by some states. Failure to comply with these state requirements could result in civil monetary penalties being assessed against us.\nWe may need additional funding in the future, and if we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development, commercial efforts, or sales efforts.\nProducing and marketing our developed products is costly. Although we believe we currently have adequate capital to fulfill our near-term funding needs, we may need to raise substantial additional capital in the future in order to execute our business plan and help us fund the development and commercialization of new products.\n- 12 -\nWe may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings and may also use debt financings or strategic collaboration and licensing arrangements. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience additional dilution; any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could result in high interest expense. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may require us to relinquish certain enumerated rights to our product candidates, processes, technologies, or development projects, or to enter into licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available from the foregoing sources, we may consider additional strategic financing options, or we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate our research or development and/or some of our commercialization efforts.\nWe may experience difficulties resulting from our new management structure, executive team and members of the Board of Directors.\nSince July 2018, the composition of our executive team and Board of Directors has changed substantially. In addition, we have implemented a new management structure throughout the organization and have recently filled a number of these positions while we are actively recruiting to fill others. Although we believe the persons who currently and will serve in these positions are and will be qualified to do so, they may take time to integrate into the organization and with each other, if at all. Many of these persons have or will have had little to no experience with our company prior to joining us, which may result in delays in our ability to implement our business plans. If we are unable to integrate, motivate and retain the services of our new executives and other managers and our directors, or if integration takes longer than we expect, it may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nChanges in tax or labor laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could increase our costs and reduce our margins.\nChanges to the tax and labor laws in the U.S. or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In particular, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Reform\u201d), including, among other things, certain changes in tax rates, deductibility of interest, deductibility of executive compensation expense, expensing of capital expenditures, the ability to use certain tax credits, taxation on earnings from international business operations, and the system of taxation (from worldwide to territorial) could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In certain instances, Tax Reform could have a negative effect on our tax rate and the carrying value of deferred tax balances. Taxing authorities may audit us from time to time and disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur manufacturing operations depend on low-cost labor. Recent increases in U.S. minimum wage requirements, as well as those imposed by the state of New York, will increase our costs for employees to support those operations, reduce our margins and negatively impact our profit.\nA downturn in global economic conditions could adversely affect our operations.\nDeterioration in the global economic environment, particularly in countries with government-sponsored healthcare systems, may cause decreased demand for our products and increased competition, which could result in lower sales volume and downward pressure on the prices for our products, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of new technologies. A weakening of economic conditions in the U.S. and/or abroad may also adversely affect our suppliers, which could result in interruptions in supply.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.\nA portion of our revenues is currently, and we expect in the future to be, derived from international operations. Our revenues from sales outside the U.S. may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors. If we cannot adequately mitigate foreign currency exchange rates, our revenues and profit may suffer.\n- 13 -\nOur distribution network and other operations outside the U.S. subject us to certain risks.\nApproximately 16% of our net sales in the year ended December 31, 2019 came from our operations outside the U.S., and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets. Our foreign operations subject us to certain risks, including, among others, the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange, uncertainties with respect to local economic and political conditions, competition from local companies, trade protectionism and restrictions on the transfer of goods across borders, U.S. diplomatic and trade relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate, foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements, local product preferences and product requirements, longer payment terms for accounts receivable than we experience in the U.S., difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations, changes to international trade agreements and treaties, changes in tax laws, weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, and import or export licensing requirements.\nIn addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws outside the U.S. Actual or alleged violation of these laws by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors could subject us to investigations by the U.S. or foreign governments, significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, and damage our reputation.\nBrexit may impact our business in the United Kingdom.\nOne of our two most significant international distributors is located in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d), and the other is in Finland, a member of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). The June 2016 referendum result in the UK to exit the EU (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d), and the subsequent commencement of the official withdrawal process by the UK government in March 2017, has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the UK and the EU. Until the terms of the transition period following the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020 are determined, it is difficult to predict its impact. It is possible that the withdrawal could, among other things, affect the legal and regulatory environments to which our business and the businesses of our distributors are subject, impact trade between the UK and the EU and other parties, and create economic and political uncertainty in the region.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws, and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. While we do not believe that we have experienced any such system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our systems, it could result in a material disruption of our operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities, damage to our reputation, and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. Additionally, such disruptions and security breaches, when there is a risk of patient harm, may require devices changes to fix vulnerabilities and strengthen cybersecurity. Such changes could, in some cases, require reporting to and approval by the FDA prior to implementation, which could cause a delay in the continued marketing of the underlying product that will result in a loss of revenues to us. Furthermore, failure to adhere to good cybersecurity practices with regards to medical devices could result in enforcement action by the FDA including warning letters or other forms of enforcement.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful.\nWe may seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky, and the integration of any newly-acquired business requires significant effort and management attention. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful.\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, increases in litigation expenses, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section. These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions and our stock price.\n- 14 -\nFuture material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations.\nActions of activist stockholders could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. If activist stockholder activities ensue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. For example, we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial and communications advisors, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, and joint venture partners, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\nNatural disasters, war and other events could adversely affect our suppliers and customers.\nNatural disasters (including pandemics), war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts, and actions taken by the U.S. and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events, could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the U.S. and areas outside of the U.S. in which we operate. Certain of the subassemblies used in our products are manufactured in Nicaragua, where there is currently civil unrest whose outcome cannot be predicted. This and similar events could increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials, result in decreased demand for our products or adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all the liabilities we may incur.\nWe face the risk of exposure to liability claims if any product that we develop causes injury. Although we carry insurance at levels customary for companies in our industry, such coverage may become unavailable or be inadequate to cover all liabilities we may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to maintain such insurance, or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise, or if the amount of any claim against us exceeds the coverage under our policies, we may face significant expenses.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with your interests as a stockholder.\nTwo stockholders, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 31% and 18%, of our outstanding common stock, respectively. An affiliate of Horton Freedom, L.P. currently serves on our Board of Directors. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in exerting influence to pursue or prevent acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. Furthermore, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future.\n- 15 -\nFuture sales and issuances of shares of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock, including pursuant to our stock option plan, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity and/or convertible securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell our common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell our common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may be materially diluted. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nWe provide and intend to continue to provide additional equity-based compensation to our employees, officers, directors, consultants and independent contractors through a stock option plan. Under our stock option plan, 6,000,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance to our employees, including officers, which number may be increased with the approval of our stockholders. If our Board elects to issue additional stock options under the plan, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to decline. Because stock options granted under the plan will generally only be exercised when the exercise price for such option is below the then market value of the common stock, the exercise of such options or the issuance of shares will cause dilution to the book value per share of our common stock and to existing and new investors.\nThere has been volatility in the price of shares of our common stock.\nSince our common stock was listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market on October 17, 2019, it has traded between $3.83 per share to $6.62 per share. Our stock price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements related to our ongoing litigation;\n\u2022\nannouncement of new products or customers by our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlow trading volume on the Nasdaq Capital Market;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions; or\n\u2022\nother events or factors that are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many biotechnology companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of medical device companies could further depress our stock price regardless of our results. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, particularly by our two most significant stockholders, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially in a short time and our stockholders could suffer losses or be unable to liquidate their holdings.\nIf we do not maintain compliance with its listing standards, NASDAQ may delist our Common Stock from trading on its exchange.\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market on which our common stock trades has continued listing standards that we must maintain on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of our common stock. If we fail to meet these continued listing requirements, our common stock may be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted and we are not able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our common stock. In addition, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future, if or when needed.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced Strategic Plan goals or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have publicly announced certain financial goals through 2020 under our Strategic Plan. Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and we may not be able to meet our goals. Our goals are based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated sales volumes and prices and cost reductions. If we are not able to meet our goals, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\n- 16 -\nWe are a smaller reporting company and non-accelerated filer, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and a \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d, as those terms are defined in the Securities Act. Accordingly, we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d and \u201cnon-accelerated filers,\u201d including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile.\nOur significant shareholders, officers and directors can sell their stock, which may have a negative effect on our stock price and ability to raise additional capital, and may make it difficult for investors to sell their stock at any price.\nA resale registration statement covering 17% and 8% of our outstanding common stock held by two stockholders, respectively, are freely tradeable in the market pursuant to a resale registration statement. These stockholders purchased those shares at prices significantly lower than the price at which our common stock is currently trading. In the event either of these significant stockholders choose to sell a substantial portion of their holdings, the price of our common stock may decline suddenly and sharply. This may make it difficult or impossible for other investors to sell their stock at any price.\nOur officers and directors beneficially own approximately 39% of our outstanding common stock as of February 27, 2020. Each individual officer and director may be able to sell up to 1% of our outstanding common stock every ninety (90) days in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, which may have a negative effect on our stock price. In addition, if our officers and directors are selling their stock into the open market, it may make it difficult or impossible for investors to sell their stock at any price.\nThe price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the future issuance and sale of shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our common stock or other equity securities future acquisitions or capital raising activities, or the effect, if any, that such issuances or sales may have on the market price of our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or other equity securities or announcement that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Any decline in the price of our common stock may encourage short sales, which could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock and may impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.\nYou may find it difficult to sell our common stock.\nOnly recently has there been any active trading market in our common stock. We cannot assure you that such an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained. Regardless of whether an active and liquid public market exists, negative fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results will likely cause the market price of our common stock to fall, making it more difficult for you to sell our common stock at a favorable price, or at all.\nIf we fail to continue to meet the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on Nasdaq. In particular, Nasdaq rules require us to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share of our common stock. If the closing bid price of our common stock were to fall below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days or we do not meet other listing requirements, we would fail to be in compliance with Nasdaq listing standards. There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum bid price requirement, or any other requirement in the future. If we fail to meet the minimum bid price requirement, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC may initiate the delisting process. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders\u2019 equity or market values of our common stock in which case, our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\n- 17 -", "PERMNO": 11275, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "KRMD"}
