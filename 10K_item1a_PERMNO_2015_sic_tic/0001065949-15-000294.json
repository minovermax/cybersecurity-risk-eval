{"cik": "1021917", "company": "JV GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should be aware that there are various risks associated with our business, including the ones discussed below. You should carefully consider these risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our business.\nOur business intends to attempt to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders. There is no assurance that this series of events will be successfully completed. Although there is no assurance, we believe we can successfully complete an acquisition or merger, which will enable us to continue as a going concern. Any acquisition or merger will most likely be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nWE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL BALANCE OF OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES\nAt June 30, 2015, we had outstanding liabilities of approximately $2,105,425 due to creditors. We have no assets, no operating business or our source of income from which to pay these creditors. Accordingly we must attempt to negotiate acceptable settlements with these outstanding creditors and then attempt to raise debt and, or, equity funding to finance the payment of the agreed settlements. There can be no assurance that we shall be able to negotiate acceptable settlements with our outstanding creditors or that we shall be able to raise the necessary debt and, or, equity finance to fund any such agreed settlements. If we are unable to settle these liabilities it is unlikely that we will be able to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders\nWE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND ANTICIPATE FUTURE LOSSES\nAt June 30, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $3,096,380 and a stockholders' deficit of approximately $2,101,903. Future losses are likely to occur as we have no sources of income to meet our operating expenses. As a result of these, among other factors, we received a report on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 from our independent accountants that include an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Consistent with our business plan, we plan on reaching satisfactory negotiated settlements with our outstanding creditors, raising additional debt and/or, equity to fund settlements with our creditors and to meet our ongoing operating expenses and attempting to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders. There can be no assurance that this series of events will be successfully completed. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in acquiring operations, generating revenues or reaching or maintaining profitable operations.\nOUR EXISTING FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ONGOING OPERATING EXPENSES\nWe have no sources of income at this time and no existing cash balances that are adequate to meet our ongoing operating expenses. In the short term, unless we are able to raise additional debt and/or, equity we shall be unable to meet our ongoing operating expenses. On a longer term basis, we plan to acquire an entity with experienced management and the opportunities for growth in exchange for shares of our common stock and are dependent on achieving a successful merger with a profitable company. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in acquiring operations, generating revenues or reaching or maintaining profitable operations.\nWE INTEND TO PURSUE THE ACQUISITION OF AN OPERATING BUSINESS\nOur sole strategy is to acquire an operating business. Successful implementation of this strategy depends on our ability to identify a suitable acquisition candidate, acquire such company on acceptable terms and integrate its operations. In pursuing acquisition opportunities, we compete with other companies with similar strategies. Competition for acquisition targets may result in increased prices of acquisition targets and a diminished pool of companies available for acquisition. Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including risks of acquiring undisclosed or undesired liabilities, acquired in-process technology, stock compensation expense, diversion of management attention, potential disputes with the seller of one or more acquired entities and possible failure to retain key acquired personnel. Any acquired entity or assets may not perform relative to our expectations. Our ability to meet these challenges has not been established.\nSCARCITY OF, AND COMPETITION FOR, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND COMBINATIONS\nWe believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than us and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Moreover, we will also compete in seeking merger or acquisition candidates with numerous other small public companies. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.\nWE HAVE NOT EXECUTED ANY FORMAL AGREEMENT FOR A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR OTHER TRANSACTION AND HAVE ESTABLISHED NO STANDARDS FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nWe have not executed any formal arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a merger with, joint venture with or acquisition of a private or public entity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying and evaluating suitable business opportunities or in concluding a business combination. We have not identified any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluation. There is no assurance we will be able to negotiate a business combination on terms favorable, if at all. We have not established a specific length of operating history or specified level of earnings, assets, net worth or other criteria which we will require a target business opportunity to have achieved, and without which we would not consider a business combination. Accordingly, we may enter into a business combination with a business opportunity having no significant operating history, losses, limited or no potential for earnings, limited assets, negative net worth or other negative characteristics.\nREDUCTION OF PERCENTAGE SHARE OWNERSHIP FOLLOWING BUSINESS COMBINATION AND DILUTION TO STOCKHOLDERS\nOur primary plan of operation is based upon a business combination with a private concern which, in all likelihood, would result in us issuing securities to stockholders of such private company. The issuance of previously authorized and unissued shares of our common stock would result in reduction in percentage of shares owned by present and prospective stockholders and may result in a change in control or management. In addition, any merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of the shares held our stockholders.\nBECAUSE INSIDERS CONTROL OUR ACTIVITIES, THAT MAY CAUSE US TO ACT IN A MANNER THAT IS MOST BENEFICIAL TO THEM AND NOT TO OUTSIDE SHAREHOLDERS WHICH COULD CAUSE US NOT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT OUTSIDE INVESTORS MIGHT VIEW FAVORABLY\nOur executive officers, directors, and holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock beneficially own approximately 98% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, they effectively control all matters requiring director and stockholder approval, including the election of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers and related party transaction. These insiders also have the ability to delay or perhaps even block, by their ownership of our stock, an unsolicited tender offer. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company that you might view favorably.\nOUR DIRECTORS MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WHICH MAY NOT BE RESOLVED FAVORABLY TO US.\nCertain conflicts of interest may exist between our directors and us. Our Directors have other business interests to which they devote their attention, and may be expected to continue to do so although management time should be devoted to our business. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise that can be resolved only through exercise of such judgment as is consistent with fiduciary duties to us.\nLOSS OF CONTROL BY OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT AND STOCKHOLDERS MAY OCCUR UPON ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES.\nWe may issue further shares as consideration for the cash or assets or services out of our authorized but unissued common stock that would, upon issuance, represent a majority of our voting power and equity. The result of such an issuance would be those new stockholders and management would control us, and persons unknown could replace our management at this time. Such an occurrence would result in a greatly reduced percentage of ownership of us by our current stockholders.\nWE MAY DEPEND UPON OUTSIDE ADVISORS, WHO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON REASONABLE TERMS AND AS NEEDED.\nTo supplement the business experience of our officers and directors, we may be required to employ accountants, technical experts, appraisers, attorneys, or other consultants or advisors. Our Board without any input from stockholders will make the selection of any such advisors. Furthermore, it is anticipated that such persons may be engaged on an \"as needed\" basis without a continuing fiduciary or other obligation to us. In the event we consider it necessary to hire outside advisors, we may elect to hire persons who are affiliates, if they are able to provide the required services.\nWE HAVE LIMITED WORKING CAPITAL AND LIMITED CASH FUNDS.\nAt June 30, 2015, we have total current assets of $3,522, of which $195 is cash on hand and $3,327 are current assets held for sale, consisting of $256 of cash and $3,071 of prepaid expenses. At June 30, 2015, we have total current liabilities of $2,105,425 out of which $1,902,277 are current liabilities held for sale. We have a working capital deficit of $2,101,903 at June 30, 2015. During the year ended June 30, 2015, we recognized revenues of $0 and a net loss of $528,415 out of which $444,267 is attributable to loss from discontinued operations with corresponding revenue from discontinued operations of $78,713.\nWe have limited funds, and such funds may not be adequate to carry out the business plan. Our cash inflows from our operating activities are not enough to cover the costs incurred by our operational activities. The ultimate success of our business may depend upon our ability to raise additional capital. We have investigated the availability, source, or terms that might\ngovern the acquisition of additional capital. If additional capital is needed, there is no assurance that funds will be available from any source or, if available, that they can be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If not available, our operations will be limited to those that can be financed with its modest capital.\nFLUCTUATION IN THE VALUE OF THE HONG KONG DOLLAR MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nOur operations have been located in Hong Kong and as such our financial activities are done in Hong Kong Dollars. In accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures (US GAAP) our financial statements are reported in U.S. Dollars. The value of the Hong Kong Dollar against the U.S. dollar may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. An appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar against the U.S. dollar could result in foreign currency translation losses for financial reporting purposes when we translate our Hong Kong denominated liabilities into U.S. Dollars, as the U.S. Dollar would likely be our reporting currency.\nJV GROUP IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES.\nWe conduct all of our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries and are dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. Moreover, our subsidiaries are currently limited in their ability to pay dividends or make distributions to us. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to fund the operations of the parent company in such manner.\nOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON THE CONTINUED RETENTION OF CERTAIN KEY PERSONNEL AND OUR ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IN THE FUTURE TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH.\nIf one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all. As a result, our business may be disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. While we depend on the abilities and participation of our current management team generally, we have a particular reliance upon Ms. Look, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of Ms. Look for any reason could significantly impact our business and results of operations.\nBECAUSE INSIDERS CONTROL OUR ACTIVITIES, THAT MAY CAUSE US TO ACT IN A MANNER THAT IS MOST BENEFICIAL TO THEM AND NOT TO OUTSIDE SHAREHOLDERS WHICH COULD CAUSE US NOT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT OUTSIDE INVESTORS MIGHT VIEW FAVORABLY.\nMr. Yeung Cheuk Hung, an affiliate of the Company, owns approximately 61% of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Yeung effectively controls all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers and related party transactions. These insiders also have the ability to delay or perhaps even block, by their ownership of our stock, an unsolicited tender offer. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company that you might view favorably.\nLOSS OF CONTROL BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY OCCUR UPON ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES.\nWe may issue additional shares, in the future, as consideration for cash, assets, or services out of our authorized but unissued common stock that would, upon issuance, represent a majority of our voting power and equity. The result of such an issuance would be those new stockholders and management would control us, and persons unknown could replace our management at this time. Such an occurrence would result in a greatly reduced percentage of ownership of us by our current stockholders.\nTHE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY SEC AND FINRA MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE TRADABILITY OF OUR SECURITIES.\nOur securities are currently listed on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets. Our shares are subject to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that imposes special sales practice requirements upon broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers or accredited investors. For purposes of the rule, the phrase \"accredited investors\" means, in general terms, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000, or individuals having a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or having an annual income that exceeds $200,000 (or that, when combined with a spouse's income, exceeds $300,000). For transactions covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and also may affect the ability of purchasers in this offering to sell their securities in any market that might develop therefore.\nIn addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a number of rules to regulate \"penny stocks.\" Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because our securities constitute \"penny stocks\" within the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply to us and to our securities. The rules may further affect the ability of owners of Shares to sell our securities in any market that might develop for them.\nShareholders should be aware that, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) \"boiler room\" practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities.\nOUR STOCK IS THINLY TRADED AND AS A RESULT YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL AT OR NEAR ASK PRICES OR AT ALL IF YOU NEED TO LIQUIDATE YOUR SHARES.\nThe shares of our common stock are thinly-traded on the OTC Markets Pink, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our shares of common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven, early stage company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our\nshares of common stock until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there are periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares of common stock is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on Securities price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our shares of Common Stock will develop or be sustained, or that any trading levels will be sustained. Due to these conditions, we can give investors no assurance that they will be able to sell their shares of common stock at or near ask prices or at all if you need money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares of common stock of our Company.\nRULE 144 SALES IN THE FUTURE MAY HAVE A DEPRESSIVE EFFECT ON OUR STOCK PRICE. All of the outstanding shares of common stock held by our present officers, directors, and affiliate stockholders are \"restricted securities\" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As restricted shares, these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that a person who has held restricted securities for six months may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1.0% of a company's outstanding common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale. There is no limit on the amount of restricted securities that may be sold by a nonaffiliated entity after the owner has held the restricted securities for a period of six months. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Act, may have a depressive effect upon the price of the common stock in any market that may develop.\nWE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, due to our illiquidity and inability to support our operations without funding from our officers, directors and shareholders. Future cash dividends will be determined by our board of directors based upon our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other relevant factors. We cannot provide any assurances or guarantees that any agreement for financing will not provide for restrictions on any future dividend payments, though our existing promissory notes do not have any such provisions.", "PERMNO": 84093, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "ASZP"}
