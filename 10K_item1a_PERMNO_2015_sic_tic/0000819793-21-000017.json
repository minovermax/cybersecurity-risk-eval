{"cik": "819793", "company": "ALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing the Company. This list is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. If any of the events contemplated by the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Some of these risks are described below and in the documents incorporated by reference, and investors should take these risks into account when evaluating any investment decision involving the Company.\nRisks related to our business and operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect will continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business, and such impacts may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken by governments, businesses, and the public at large to limit COVID-19's spread has had, and are expected to continue to have, certain negative effects on the markets we serve. These effects include deteriorating general economic conditions in many regions of the world, increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, decline in consumer confidence, and changes in consumer spending habits. Certain adverse impacts specific to the Company include, without limitation:\n\u2022 During 2020, some employees in various plants contracted the COVID-19 virus, which led to workforce absences of employees that contracted the virus and others that may have been exposed. Highly contagious diseases such as COVID-19 create the risk that we may need to shut down one of our facilities for an extended period of time, which could increase our costs and affect our ability to meet commitments to customers.\n\u2022 We have experienced larger-than-anticipated declines in demand for MC fabrics used to make certain paper grades, specifically publication paper grades, that could be COVID-19 related. Additionally, behavioral changes that have occurred during the pandemic have impacted demand for various products that are made with MC fabrics. The above effects are likely to continue to have an adverse impact on demand for publication paper grades, and perhaps other grades of paper, including without limitation packaging paper grades, as well as on demand for non-woven fabrics and fiber cement products used in the construction industry; such impacts would in turn adversely impact demand for the MC products used to manufacture such paper grades or building products. A decline in revenues would lead to lower gross profit on those products and the possibility of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs.\n\u2022 The Albany Engineered Composites segment generates a significant portion of its revenue from commercial aerospace programs and contracts for the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted passenger air travel which, in turn, has impacted and is likely to continue to impact the commercial aerospace programs that provide a source of revenue for the Company. Such programs could be delayed or canceled which, in addition to a loss of revenue and gross profit, could lead to write-offs for Company investments for those programs. The pandemic has resulted in significant costs for the U.S. government, which could lead to program delays or cancellations, and a corresponding decrease in our revenues. The outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election could increase the uncertainties associated with DOD programs.\n\u2022 Disruptions in supply chains may place constraints on our ability to source key raw materials and services which could impact our ability to deliver products to customers as scheduled. Additionally, manufacturing or delivery costs could increase.\n\u2022 During periods of economic weakness, the Company may be exposed to greater credit risk. Additionally, we could be required to record significant impairment charges with respect to noncurrent assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, whose fair values may be negatively affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations.\nA number of industry factors have had, and in future periods could have, an adverse impact on sales, profitability and cash flow in the Company\u2019s MC and AEC segments\nSignificant consolidation and rationalization in the paper industry in recent years have reduced global consumption of paper machine clothing in certain markets. Developments in digital media have adversely affected\nIndex\ndemand for newsprint and for printing and writing grades of paper, which has had, and is likely to continue to have, an adverse effect on demand for paper machine clothing in those markets. At the same time, technological advances in papermaking, including in paper machine clothing, while contributing to the papermaking efficiency of customers, have in some cases lengthened the useful life of our products and reduced the number of pieces required to produce the same volume of paper. These factors have had, and in the future are likely to have, an adverse effect on paper machine clothing sales.\nThe market for paper machine clothing in recent years has been characterized by continuous pressure to provide more favorable commercial terms, which has unfavorably affected our operating results. We expect such pressure to remain intense in all paper machine clothing markets, especially during periods of customer consolidation, plant closures, or when major contracts are being renegotiated. The emergence of Chinese competitors exacerbates this risk.\nSimilar pressures exist in the markets in which AEC competes. During 2019, Net sales under the LEAP contract exceeded $210 million. Due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and the impact of the pandemic on air travel, 2020 Net sales generated by the LEAP contract declined to less than $95 million.\nAdditionally, the LEAP long-term supply agreement contains certain events of default that, if triggered, could result in termination of the agreement by the customer, which would also have a material adverse impact on segment sales and profitability. Additionally, many of AEC\u2019s customers, as well as the companies supplied by our customers are under pressure to achieve acceptable returns on their substantial investments in recent years in new technologies, new programs and new product introductions. This has contributed to a relentless focus on reducing costs, resulting in continuous pressure for cost reduction and pricing improvement throughout the supply chain. The recent wave of consolidation in the aerospace industry could continue or intensify these pressures.\nThe long-term organic growth prospects of AEC are subject to a number of risks\nThe prospect of future successful organic growth in AEC depends in large part on its ability to maintain and grow a healthy pipeline of potential new products and applications for its technologies, to transform a sufficient number of those potential opportunities into commercial supply agreements, and to then execute its obligations under such agreements. In addition, existing and future supply agreements, especially for commercial and defense aerospace, are subject to the same curtailment or cancellation risks as the programs they support.\nAEC is currently working on a broad portfolio of potential new product applications in the aerospace industry. These development projects may or may not result in commercial supply opportunities. In the event that AEC succeeds in developing products and securing contracts to manufacture and supply them, it will face the same industrialization and manufacturing ramp-up risks that it currently faces in its existing contracts, and AEC may or may not be successful in meeting its obligations under these contracts. Failure to manage these development, commercialization and execution risks could have a material adverse impact on AEC\u2019s prospects for revenue growth.\nIn addition to dealing with these development and manufacturing execution risks, future AEC growth will likely require increasingly larger amounts of cash to fund the investments in equipment, capital, and development efforts needed to achieve this growth. Until AEC is able to consistently generate positive cash flows, it will remain dependent on the MC segment\u2019s ability to generate cash. A significant decline in MC sales, operating income or cash flows could therefore have a material adverse impact on AEC\u2019s growth.\nAEC is subject to significant risks related to the potential manufacture and sale of defective or non-conforming products\nAEC manufactures and sells products that are incorporated into commercial and military aircraft. If AEC were to supply products with manufacturing defects, or products that failed to conform to contractual requirements, we could be required to recall and/or replace them, and could also be subject to substantial contractual damages or warranty claims from our customers. AEC could also be subject to product liability claims if such failures were to cause death, injury or losses to third parties, or damage claims resulting from the grounding of aircraft into which such defective or non-conforming products had been incorporated. While we maintain product liability insurance and other insurance at levels we believe to be prudent and consistent with industry practice to help mitigate these risks, these coverages may not be sufficient to fully cover AEC\u2019s exposure for such risks, which could have a material adverse effect on AEC\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nDeterioration of global economic conditions could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations\nIndex\nThe Company identifies in this section a number of risks, the effects of which may be exacerbated by an unfavorable economic climate. For example, a recession could lead to lower consumption in all paper grades including tissue and packaging, which would not only reduce consumption of paper machine clothing but could also increase the risk of greater price competition in the machine clothing industry.\nSimilarly, in the Company\u2019s AEC segment, a decline in global or regional economic conditions could result in lower orders for aircraft or aircraft engines, or the cancellation of existing orders, which would in turn result in reduced demand for the AEC components utilized on such aircraft or engines. Demand for AEC\u2019s light-weight composite aircraft components is driven by demand for the lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft engine and other applications into which they are incorporated, such as the CFM LEAP engine. Fuel costs are a significant part of operating costs for airlines and, in many cases, may constitute a carrier\u2019s single largest operating expense. A sustained drop in oil prices, and related decline in the price of jet fuel, could prompt airlines to defer orders or delivery dates for such newer, more fuel-efficient airframes and aircraft engines, as the urgency to reduce fuel consumption may be lessened. In addition, any economic conditions that led to sustained high interest rates could affect the airline\u2019s ability to finance new aircraft and engine orders.\nWeak or unstable economic conditions also increase the risk that one or more of our customers could be unable to pay outstanding accounts receivable, whether as the result of bankruptcy or an inability to obtain working capital financing from banks or other lenders. In such a case, we could be forced to write off such accounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Furthermore, both the MC and AEC business segments manufacture products that are custom-designed for a specific customer application. In the event of a customer liquidity issue, the Company could also be required to write off amounts that are included in Contract assets,net or Inventories. In the case of AEC, such write-offs could also include investments in equipment, tooling, and non-recurring engineering, some of which could be significant depending on the program.\nThe Company may experience supply constraints due to a limited number of suppliers of certain raw materials and equipment\nThere are a limited number of suppliers of polymer fiber and monofilaments, key raw materials used in the manufacture of machine clothing, and of carbon fiber and carbon resin, key raw materials used by AEC. In addition, there are a limited number of suppliers of some of the equipment used in each of the MC and AEC segments. The risks associated with limited suppliers were increased during 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic put pressure on the supply chain, as well as transportation companies that deliver our products to customers. While we have always been able to meet our raw material and equipment needs, the limited number of suppliers of these items creates the potential for disruptions in supply. AEC currently relies on single suppliers under contracts they have with SAFRAN to meet the carbon fiber and carbon resin requirements for the LEAP program. Lack of supply, delivery delays, or quality problems relating to supplied raw materials or for our key manufacturing equipment could harm our production capacity, and could require the Company to attempt to qualify one or more additional suppliers, which could be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. Such disruptions could make it difficult to supply our customers with products on time, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSome of the Company\u2019s competitors in the MC segment have the capability to make and sell paper machines and papermaking equipment as well as other engineered fabrics\nAlthough customers historically have tended to view the purchase of paper machine clothing and the purchase of paper machines as separate purchasing decisions, the ability to bundle fabrics with new machines and after-market services could provide an advantage to our competitors. This underscores the importance of our ability to maintain the technological competitiveness and value of our products, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMoreover, we cannot predict how the nature of competition in this segment may continue to evolve as a result of future consolidation among our competitors, or consolidation involving our competitors and other suppliers to our customers.\nConditions in the paper industry have required, and could further require, the Company to reorganize its operations, which could result in significant expense and could pose risks to the Company\u2019s operations\nDuring the last several years, we have engaged in significant restructuring that included the closing of manufacturing operations. These restructuring activities were intended to match manufacturing capacity to shifting global demand, and also to improve the efficiency of manufacturing and administrative processes. Future shifting of\nIndex\ncustomer demand, the need to reduce costs, or other factors could cause us to determine in the future that additional restructuring steps are required. Restructuring involves risks such as employee work stoppages, slowdowns, or strikes, which can threaten uninterrupted production, maintenance of high product quality, meeting of customers\u2019 delivery deadlines, and maintenance of administrative processes. Increases in output in remaining manufacturing operations can likewise impose stress on these remaining facilities as they undertake the manufacture of greater volume and, in some cases, a greater variety of products. Competitors can be quick to attempt to exploit these situations. Although we plan each step of the process carefully, and work to reassure customers who could be affected that their requirements will continue to be met, we could lose customers and associated revenues if we fail to execute properly.\nNatural disasters at one or more of our facilities could make it difficult for us to meet our supply obligations to our customers\nAEC\u2019s production of LEAP engine components is currently located in three facilities. A natural disaster at any of these locations would have a significant adverse effect on AEC\u2019s ability to timely satisfy orders for LEAP components. Production of almost all of AEC\u2019s other legacy and growth programs - including components for the, fuselage components for the Boeing 787, components for the CH-53K helicopter, vacuum waste tanks for Boeing 7-Series aircraft, and missile bodies for Lockheed Martin\u2019s JASSM air-to-surface missiles - is located primarily in facilities in Salt Lake City, Utah or Boerne, Texas.\nSignificant consolidation of manufacturing operations in our MC segment over the past decade has reduced the number of facilities available to produce our products, and increased utilization significantly at remaining facilities. Not all product lines are produced at, or capable of being produced at, all facilities. We have Machine Clothing facilities located near Mexico City, which has been identified as an area vulnerable to flood, storm surge and earthquake risks, and in the Pearl River Delta area of China, which has been identified as vulnerable to flood, storm and storm surge risks.\nA significant interruption in the operation of any one or more of our plants, whether as the result of a natural disaster or other causes, could significantly impair our ability to timely meet our supply obligations to customers being supplied from an affected facility. While the occurrence of a natural disaster or other business interruption event in an area where we have a facility may not result in any direct damage to the facility itself, it may cause disruptions in local transportation and public utilities on which such locations are reliant, and may also hinder the ability of affected employees to report for work. Although we carry property and business interruption insurance to help mitigate the risk of property loss or business interruption that could result from the occurrence of such events, such coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all loss or damage that we may incur.\nInflation as a result of changes in prices of commodities and labor costs may adversely impact our financial results of operations\nThe Company is a significant user of raw materials that are based on petroleum or petroleum derivatives. Increases in the prices of petroleum or petroleum derivatives, particularly in regions that are experiencing higher levels of inflation, could increase our costs, and we may not be able to fully offset the effects through price increases, productivity improvements, and cost-reduction programs.\nThe Company also relies on the labor market in many regions of the world to meet our operational requirements, advance our technology and differentiate products. Low rates of unemployment in key geographic areas in which the Company operates can lead to high rates of turnover and loss of critical talent, which could in turn lead to higher labor costs.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover other significant risk exposures\nIn addition to asbestos-related claims, the Company may be exposed to other liabilities related to the products and services we provide. AEC is engaged in designing, developing, and manufacturing components for commercial jet aircraft and defense and technology systems and products. We expect this portion of the business to grow in future periods. Although we maintain insurance for the risks associated with this business, there can be no assurance that the amount of our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us in the future at a cost that is acceptable. Any material liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIndex\nThe Company has significant manufacturing operations outside of the U.S., which could involve many uncertainties\nWe currently have manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. In 2020, 44% percent of consolidated Net sales were generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Operations outside of the U.S. are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including: governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds; governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments from our non-U.S. operations, or the amount of any such taxes may increase; an outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur; governments may seek to nationalize our assets; or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business. In addition, emerging markets pose other uncertainties, including the protection of our intellectual property, pressure on the pricing of our products, and risks of political instability. The occurrence of any of these conditions could disrupt our business or prevent us from conducting business in particular countries or regions of the world.\nWe have significant manufacturing operations outside of the United States. Changes in U.S. trade policy with foreign countries, or other changes in U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade, as well as any responsive or retaliatory changes in regulations or policies by such countries, could have an adverse impact on our business, either directly or in the form of increased costs due to their impacts on our supply chain. While the direct impact to date of recent developments in global trade and tariff policy has not been significant, there is a risk that the impact of such developments on companies in our supply chain will be reflected in higher costs from affected suppliers. In addition, the Company has manufacturing operations in the United Kingdom that could be impacted by uncertainties surrounding Brexit.\nOur global presence subjects us to certain risks, including controls on foreign exchange and the repatriation of funds. While we have been able to repatriate current earnings in excess of working capital requirements from certain countries in which we operate without substantial governmental restrictions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to cost effectively repatriate foreign earnings in the future.\nRisks related to our contracts\nAEC is subject to significant financial risk related to potential quality escapes that could cause customer recalls, or production shortfalls that could cause delays in customer deliveries\nAEC manufactures critical aerospace parts and must meet increasingly demanding quality, delivery, and cost targets across a broad spectrum of programs and facilities. AEC\u2019s ability to realize its full financial objectives will depend on how effectively it meets these challenges. Failure to accomplish these customer quality, delivery, and cost targets on any key program could result in material losses to the Company and have a material adverse impact on the amount and timing of anticipated AEC revenues, income, and cash flows, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results.\nLong-term supply contracts in our Albany Engineered Composites segment pose certain risks\nAEC has a number of long-term contracts with fixed pricing, and is likely to enter into similar contracts in the future. While long-term contracts provide an opportunity to realize steady and reliable revenues for extended periods, they pose a number of risks, such as program cancellations, reductions or delays in orders by AEC\u2019s customers under these contracts, the termination of such contracts or orders, or the occurrence of similar events over which AEC has no or limited control. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on AEC revenues and earnings in any period. Such events could also result in the write-off of deferred charges that have been accumulated in anticipation of future revenues. Additionally, we may enter into contracts that are expected to generate profits over the life of the contract but, under current accounting standards, we could be required to recognize a loss at the inception of the contract.\nWhile long-term fixed-price contracts also provide AEC with the opportunity to enjoy increased profits as the result of cost reductions and efficiencies, their profitability is dependent on estimates and assumptions regarding contract performance costs over the life of the contract, which in some cases can last for many years. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to many variables, and may prove over time to have been inaccurate when made, or may become inaccurate over time, which can lead to volatility of AEC\u2019s earnings in any period. Additionally, many of\nIndex\nthe parts AEC agrees to develop and produce have highly complex designs, and challenging technical, quality, and engineering specifications. Manufacturing or development challenges, disagreements over technical, quality or other contract requirements, and other variables may arise during development or production that result in higher costs, or an inability to achieve required specifications. If actual production and/or development costs should prove higher, or revenues prove lower, than AEC\u2019s estimates, our expected profits may be reduced, or if such costs should exceed contract prices, we may be required to recognize losses for current or future periods. One or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on AEC\u2019s revenues or operating results in any period. Such events could also result in the write-off of deferred charges that have been or could be accumulated in anticipation of future revenues.\nEach quarter, the Company updates its outlook for each of its long-term contracts and records the effect of the change in estimated profitability. While the Company believes its estimates on long-term contracts to be accurate based on available information, new information may become available in future periods, or other changes in the program could occur, which may lead to additional program losses, which could have a material effect on operating results in future periods.\nSales of components for a number of programs that are currently considered to be important to the future sales growth of AEC are pursuant to short-term purchase orders for a finite period or number of parts, or short-term supply agreements with terms of one to four years. Such programs include airframe components for the, forward fuselage frames for the Boeing 787, and sponsons, tail-rotor pylons, horizontal stabilizers and struts for the CH-53K helicopter. As a result, while AEC reasonably expects to continue as a supplier on these programs as long as it meets its obligations, there can be no assurance that this will be the case, or that, in programs where it is currently a sole supplier that this sole supplier status will continue even if it continues as a supplier. Even if AEC\u2019s status as a supplier is extended or renewed, there can be no assurance that such extension or renewal will be on the same or similar commercial or other terms. Any failure by AEC to maintain its current supplier status under these programs, or any material change in their commercial or other terms, could have a material adverse effect on AEC\u2019s future sales and operating income.\nAEC derives a significant portion of its revenue from contracts with the U.S. government, which are subject to unique risks\nThe funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations. Many of the U.S. government programs in which we participate may last several years, but they are normally funded annually. Changes in military strategy and priorities may affect future opportunities and/or existing programs. Long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation, delay or restructure, if appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. The termination or reduction of funding for existing or new U.S. government programs could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and financial position.\nAdditionally, our business with the U.S. government is subject to specific procurement regulations and our contract costs are subject to audits by U.S. government agencies. U.S. government representatives may audit our compliance with government regulations, and such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If any audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government, which could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and financial position.\nThe loss of one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on sales and profitability\nOne customer (Safran) accounted for approximately 30 percent of Net sales in the AEC segment in 2020, substantially all of which was under an exclusive long-term supply agreement relating to parts for the LEAP engine. Although we are an exclusive supplier of such parts, our customer is not obligated to purchase any minimum quantity of parts, and cancellation or significant reduction in demand for the LEAP program would have a material adverse impact on segment sales and profitability. LEAP engines are currently used on the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320neo and COMAC aircraft. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX during 2019 and 2020 led to lower deliveries of parts and could result in significantly lower revenue in future periods than previously expected.\nThe LEAP long-term supply agreement contains certain events of default that, if triggered, could result in termination of the agreement by the customer, which would also have a material adverse impact on segment sales and profitability.\nIndex\nA substantial portion of AEC\u2019s non-LEAP revenue in the near term, and revenue growth opportunity in the longer term, is dependent upon a small number of customers and programs. Unlike the 3D-woven composite components supplied by ASC, parts supplied for such non-LEAP programs are capable of being made by a number of other suppliers. Such programs include airframe components for the, forward fuselage frames for the Boeing 787, and sponsons, tail-rotor pylons, horizontal stabilizers and struts for the CH-53K helicopter. Any failure by AEC to maintain its current supplier status under these programs, or any material change in their commercial or other terms, could have a material adverse effect on AEC\u2019s future sales and operating income.\nOur top ten customers in the MC segment accounted for a significant portion of our Net sales in 2020. The loss of one or more of these customers, or a significant decrease in the amount of machine clothing they purchase from us, could have a material adverse impact on segment sales and profitability. We could also be subject to similar impacts if one or more such customers were to suffer financial difficulties and be unable to pay us for products they have purchased. While we normally enter into long-term supply agreements with significant MC customers, the agreements generally do not obligate the customer to purchase any products from us, and may be terminated by the customer at any time with appropriate notice.\nRisks related to cybersecurity\nThe Company is increasingly dependent on information technology and our business, systems, assets and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity and data leakage risks. The failure to prevent attacks on our operational systems or infrastructure could result in disruptions to our businesses, or the loss or disclosure of confidential and proprietary intellectual property or other assets\nAs our dependence on information technology and communication systems has increased, so have the risks associated with cyber-attacks from third parties attempting to gain access to our systems, data, or assets using varied means, from electronic \u201chacking\u201d to traditional social engineering aimed at our employees. The Company has been the target of such attacks, none of which have had, individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on the Company. We will likely continue to be the target of such attacks which could have a material impact in future periods.\nAny significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of our business systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information or other assets, or reputational damage. While we have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in business systems, information technology infrastructure, internal controls systems and employee training to attempt to reduce these risks, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns, losses or breaches that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks related to our financial matters\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations\nWe operate our business in many regions of the world, and currency rate movements can have a significant effect on operating results. The effect of currency rate changes on gross profit in the MC segment can be difficult to anticipate because we use a global sourcing and manufacturing model. Under this model, while some non-U.S. sales and associated costs are in the same currency, other non-U.S. sales are denominated in currencies other than the currency in which most costs of such sales are incurred. At the same time, the geographic sources of materials purchased (and the currencies in which these purchases are denominated) can vary depending on market forces, and the Company may also shift production of its products between manufacturing locations, which can result in a change in the currency in which certain costs to produce such products are incurred.\nChanges in exchange rates can result in revaluation gains and losses that are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses or Other expense, net. Revaluation gains and losses occur when our business units have cash, intercompany or third-party trade receivable or payable balances in a currency other than their local reporting (or functional) currency. Operating results can also be affected by the translation of sales and costs, for each non-U.S. subsidiary, from the local functional currency to the U.S. dollar. The translation effect on the income statement is dependent on our net income or expense position in each non-U.S. currency in which we do business. A net income position exists when sales realized in a particular currency exceed expenses paid in that currency; a net expense position exists if the opposite is true.\nIndex\nAs a result of these exposures to foreign currency transactions and balances, changes in currency rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding long-term debt of $398 million\nAt December 31, 2020, our leverage ratio (as defined in our primary borrowing agreement) was 1.34 to 1.00, and we had borrowed $398 million under our $700 million revolving credit facility. While we feel that we generate sufficient cash from operations and have sufficient borrowing capacity to make required capital expenditures to maintain and grow our business, any decrease in our cash generation could result in higher leverage. Higher leverage could hinder our ability to make acquisitions, capital expenditures, or other investments in our businesses, pay dividends, or withstand business and economic downturns. Our primary borrowing agreement contains a number of covenants and financial ratios that the Company is required to satisfy. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to prescribed leverage and interest coverage ratios and asset dispositions. Any breach of any such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under such agreement that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such agreement to be immediately due and payable and, through cross-default provisions, could entitle other lenders to accelerate their loans. In such an event, the Company would need to modify or restructure all or a portion of such indebtedness. Depending on prevailing economic conditions at the time, the Company might find it difficult to modify or restructure the debt on attractive terms, or at all.\nWe use interest rate swap agreements to help manage the interest cost associated with our borrowings. We account for those swaps as a hedge of future cash flows and, accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in Other comprehensive income. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the interest rate swaps are currently based on LIBOR, which is expected to be phased out and replaced starting in 2022. Future changes in the interest rate benchmark could affect the Company\u2019s cash flows, or the effectiveness of the swap agreements, which could have an effect on net income.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $302 million of additional borrowing capacity under our $700 million revolving credit facility. Incurrence of additional indebtedness could increase the above-described risks associated with higher leverage. In addition, any such indebtedness could contain terms that are more restrictive than our current facilities.\nChanges in actuarial assumptions and differences between actual experience and assumptions could adversely affect our pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities\nAlthough we have reduced pension liabilities by a significant amount during the past few years, as of December 31, 2020, remaining net liabilities under our defined benefit pension plans exceeded plan assets by $6.7 million ($4.5 million for the U.S. plan, $2.2 million for non-U.S. plans). Additionally, the liability for unfunded postretirement welfare benefits, principally in the United States, totaled $48.0 million. Annual expense associated with these plans, as well as annual cash contributions, are subject to a number of variables, including discount rates, return on plan assets, mortality, and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience. Those liabilities include $61.2 million of deferred costs which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income. The deferred costs will be amortized into expense in future periods, or a significant charge could be recorded if we were to settle pension or postretirement obligations.\nAlthough the Company has taken actions to hedge certain pension plan assets to the pension liabilities, weakness in investment returns on plan assets, changes in discount rates or actuarial assumptions, and actual future experience could result in higher benefit plan expense and the need to increase pension plan contributions in future years.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of increased expense in health-care related costs\nWe are largely self-insured for some employee and business risks, including health care and workers\u2019 compensation programs in the United States. Losses under all of these programs are accrued based upon estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries and service providers. However, these liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an illness or injury and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals to be adequate. The Company also maintains stop-loss insurance policies to protect against catastrophic claims above certain limits. If\nIndex\nactual results significantly differ from estimates, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially impacted by losses under these programs, as well as higher stop-loss premiums in future periods.\nChanges in or interpretations of tax rules, structures, country profitability mix, and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rate\nWe are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions. Unanticipated changes in tax rates, or tax policies in the countries in which we operate, could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by structural changes in the Company\u2019s businesses, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, changes in the tax laws in any country may be difficult to interpret without additional guidance, which could lead to future adjustments to our financial statements.\nThe Company has substantial deferred tax assets that could become impaired, resulting in a charge to earnings\nThe Company has substantial deferred tax assets in several tax jurisdictions, including the U.S. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon many factors, including the generation of future taxable income in specific countries (See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein, for a discussion of this matter). Lower than expected operating results, organizational changes, or changes in tax laws could result in those deferred tax assets becoming impaired, thus resulting in a charge to earnings.\nOur business could be adversely affected by adverse outcomes of pending or future tax audits\nThe Company is currently under audit in certain jurisdictions and is likely to be audited in the future. While the Company believes its tax filings to be correct, a final adverse outcome with respect to pending or future audits could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results in any period in which it occurs.\nRisks related to our legal and regulatory environment\nThe Company may fail to adequately protect its proprietary technology, which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of its research and development efforts\nProprietary trade secrets are a source of competitive advantage in each of our segments. If our trade secrets were to become available to competitors, it could have a negative impact on our competitive strength. We employ measures to maintain the confidential nature of these secrets, including maintaining employment and confidentiality agreements; maintaining clear policies intended to protect such trade secrets; educating our employees about such policies; clearly identifying proprietary information subject to such agreements and policies; and vigorously enforcing such agreements and policies. Despite such measures, our employees, consultants, and third parties to whom such information may be disclosed in the ordinary course of our business may breach their obligations not to reveal such information, and any legal remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages.\nThe Company is subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, and has been named as defendant in a large number of suits relating to the actual or alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings. Pending proceedings that the Company determines are material are disclosed in Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein. Litigation is an inherently unpredictable process and unanticipated negative outcomes are always possible. An adverse outcome in any period could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results for that period.\nWe are also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal compliance risks will continue to exist and related legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which\nIndex\ncannot be predicted with certainty, are likely to arise from time to time. Failure to resolve successfully any legal proceedings related to compliance matters could have an adverse impact on our results in any period.\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to employment practices and benefits, taxes, import and export matters, corruption, foreign-exchange controls, competition, workplace health and safety, intellectual property, health-care, the environment and other areas. These laws and regulations have a significant impact on our domestic and international operations.\nWe incur significant expenses to comply with laws and regulations. Changes or additions to laws and regulations could increase these expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Such changes could also have an adverse impact on our customers and suppliers, which in turn could adversely impact the Company.\nChanges in laws and regulations could also place restrictions on our ability to sell certain products, or to source certain input products from certain suppliers, both of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we have implemented policies and training programs designed to ensure compliance, there can be no assurance that our employees or agents will not violate such laws, regulations or policies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Standish Family continues to have considerable influence over the management and affairs of the Company and matters requiring stockholder approval\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Standish Family had held in the aggregate shares entitling them to cast 34.5 percent of the combined votes entitled to be cast by all stockholders of the Company. The Standish Family continues to have considerable influence over the management and affairs of the Company and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or a merger, consolidation, or other business combination at a premium price, even if such transaction were favored by our other stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Delaware law could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of us that you might consider favorable, which could also adversely affect the price of our Class A Common Stock\nCertain provisions under our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval. Depending on the rights and terms of any new series created, and the reaction of the market to the series, the rights or value of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively affected. For example, subject to applicable law, our board of directors could create a series of preferred stock with superior voting rights to our existing common stock. The ability of our board of directors to issue this new series of preferred stock could also prevent or delay a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe may not pay cash dividends on our Common Stock\nIt is our current practice to pay cash dividends on our common stock. There can be no assurance, however, that we will pay dividends in the future in the amounts that we have in the past, or at all. Our board of directors may change the timing and amount of any future dividend payments or eliminate the payment of future dividends in its sole discretion, without any prior notice to our stockholders. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon many factors, including our financial position and liquidity, results of operations, legal requirements, restrictions that may be imposed by the terms of our current and future credit facilities and other debt obligations and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. For example, we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and while we feel that we generate sufficient cash from operations and have sufficient borrowing capacity to make required capital expenditures\nIndex\nto maintain and grow our business, any decrease in our cash generation could result in higher leverage. Higher leverage could hinder our ability to make acquisitions, capital expenditures, or other investments in our businesses, pay dividends, or withstand business and economic downturns.\nIn the future, we may also enter into other credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements or issue debt securities that, in each case, restrict or limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock. In addition, since a significant portion of our cash is generated from operations of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends is in part dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries - some of which are located outside of the United States - to make distributions to us. Such distributions will be subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, as well as our ability to repatriate cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline\nThe trading market for our Class A Common Stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our Class A Common Stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A Common Stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of shares by us or our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of February 19, 2021 we had 30,706,635 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding and 1,617,998 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding, each of which is convertible at any time into an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, shares of Class A Common Stock are issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of outstanding equity awards, and certain shares are reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans.", "PERMNO": 11731, "SIC": 2221, "TIC": "AIN"}
