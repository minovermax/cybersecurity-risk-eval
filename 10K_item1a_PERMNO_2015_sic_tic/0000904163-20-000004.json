RISK FACTORS\nOur performance is dependent on our ability to manage complex operational, financial, legal, and regulatory risks and uncertainties throughout our operations. The most significant of these risks and uncertainties are described below. Any of these, individually or in the aggregate, could materially and adversely impair our business, financial condition or results of operations, particularly if our actual experience differs from our estimates and assumptions. While our enterprise risk management framework contains various strategies, processes, policies and procedures to address these risks and uncertainties, we cannot be certain that these measures will be implemented successfully in all circumstances. In addition, we could experience risks that we failed to identify, or risks of a magnitude greater than expected.\nEconomic and Investment Market Risk Factors\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic and political conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere. The strength and sustainability of economic activity is inherently uncertain. Factors such as unemployment, workforce participation levels, consumer prices, domestic political uncertainty, geopolitical and international trade issues, energy prices, stagnant or declining family incomes, consumer confidence and spending, and increased student and consumer debt can adversely affect the economy and demand for our products. Unfavorable economic developments could adversely affect us if our customers have less need for insurance coverage, cancel existing insurance policies, modify coverage, or choose not to renew with us. Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay premiums as they come due.\nInterest rates have a significant impact on our business and on consumer demand for our products. When interest rates rise, the value of our investment portfolio may decline due to decreases in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities. In addition, increasing rates on other insurance or investment products offered by competitors can lead to higher surrenders by our customers at a time when fixed maturity investment asset values are lower. We may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates, which narrows our \u201cspread,\u201d or the difference between the amounts we earn on investments and the amount we must pay under our contracts. Decreasing interest rates also can adversely affect our spreads, particularly with interest-sensitive life insurance and fixed annuities. An environment of persistently low (or lower) interest rates, as in recent years, compounds this spread compression. Further, when market interest rates decrease or remain at relatively low levels, prepayments and redemptions affecting our investment securities and mortgage loan investments may increase as issuers and borrowers seek to refinance at a lower rate. Proceeds from maturing, prepaid or sold bonds or mortgage loan investments may be reinvested at lower yields, reducing our spread. Our ability to decrease product crediting rates in response may be limited by market and competitive conditions and by regulatory or contractual minimum rate guarantees. While we use ALM processes to mitigate the effect on our spreads of changes in interest rates, they may not be fully effective. See the Risk Management discussion in Item 1 above and the General Trends discussion in Part II, Item 7 below for further details about interest rates and our ALM processes.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - (Continued)\nFluctuations in the markets for fixed maturity securities, equity securities, and commercial real estate could adversely affect our business. Investment returns are an important part of our profitability. Substantially all investments, including our fixed maturity, equity, real estate and mortgage loan investment portfolios, are subject to market and credit risks, including market volatility and deterioration in the credit or prospects of companies or governmental entities in which we invest. We could incur significant losses from such risks, particularly during extreme market events. The concentration of our investments in any particular industry, group of related industries or government issuers, or geographic area can compound these risks. Moreover, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may move further towards normalizing monetary policy from the programs of recent years that have fostered a historically low interest rate environment. In addition to resulting in higher interest rates, such a move may generate volatility in debt and equity markets.\nIn addition to negatively affecting investment returns, equity market downturns and volatility can have other adverse effects on us. First, equity market downturns and volatility may discourage new purchases of our products that have returns linked to the performance of the equity market and may cause some existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce investments in such products, in turn reducing our fee revenues. Second, the guarantees provided under certain products may cost more than expected in volatile or declining equity market conditions, which could negatively affect our earnings. Third, our estimates of liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits incorporate assumptions regarding the rate used to discount estimated future liabilities and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. Declines in the discount rate or the rate of return on plan assets, both of which are influenced by potential investment returns, could increase our required cash contributions or pension-related expenses in future periods.\nSome of our investments are relatively illiquid. Investments in privately placed securities, mortgage loans, and real estate, including real estate joint ventures and other equity interests, are relatively illiquid. If we suddenly require significant amounts of cash in excess of ordinary cash requirements, it may be difficult or not possible to sell these investments in an orderly manner for a favorable price.\nThe discontinuance of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") may adversely affect the interest rates on and value of certain derivatives we hold, and any other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. As a result, it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued after 2021. In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a broad measure of the cost of overnight cash borrowing collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, as an alternative to LIBOR. A transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to SOFR or another benchmark rate may occur over the next few years.\nWe are evaluating our current exposure to LIBOR-based financial instruments, such as derivatives we use for hedging. The effect of the discontinuance of or any changes to LIBOR on new or existing financial instruments to which we have exposure will vary depending on whether fallback provisions exist in individual contracts and whether, how, and when industry participants develop and widely adopt new benchmark rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new instruments. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot predict the overall effect of the discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates. The discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates, or any uncertainty in relation to the timing and manner of such actions, could have an adverse effect on the value of investments in our investment portfolio, derivatives we use for hedging, or other indebtedness, securities or commercial contracts to which we are a party.\nOperational Risk Factors\nOur actual experience could differ from our estimates and assumptions. Our product pricing includes long-term assumptions such as investment returns, mortality, morbidity (the rate of incidence of illness), persistency (the rate at which policies remain in-force), and operating expenses. Our profitability substantially depends on actual experience being consistent with or better than these assumptions. If we fail to appropriately price our insured risks, or if claims experience is more severe than we assumed, our earnings and financial condition may be negatively affected. Conversely, significantly overpriced risks may negatively impact new business sales and retention of existing business.\nOur loss reserves are estimates of amounts needed to pay and administer incurred claims and, as such, are inherently uncertain; they do not and cannot represent exact measures of liability. Inflationary events, especially events outside of historical norms, or regulatory changes that affect the assumptions underlying our estimates can cause variability. For example, increases in costs for auto parts and repair services, construction costs, and commodities (whether as a result of market forces, tariffs or other conditions or events) result in higher losses for property damage claims. Accordingly, our loss reserves could prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses and related expenses. See Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Reserves for additional information.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - (Continued)\nWith respect to our investments, the determination of estimates for allowances and impairments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Historical trends and assumed changes may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of our evaluation of impairments.\nAssumptions regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets are dependent upon estimating the generation of sufficient future taxable income, including capital gains. If future events differ from our current forecasts and it is determined that deferred tax assets cannot be realized, a deferred tax valuation allowance must be established, with a charge to expenses.\nInterest rate fluctuations and other events may require us to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (\u201cDAC\u201d). When interest rates rise, life and annuity surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek to buy products with higher or perceived higher returns, impacting estimates of future profits. Significantly lower future profits may cause us to accelerate DAC amortization, and such acceleration could adversely affect our results of operations to the extent such amortization exceeds any surrender or other charges earned as income upon surrender and withdrawal. See also Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates, and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, and Note 10, Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe may be unable to maintain the availability and performance of our systems and to safeguard our data and our customers' confidential information and privacy. We rely on the availability, reliability, and security of internet technologies, our internal networks, information-processing infrastructure, system platforms, business applications and third-party providers to receive, store, process, retrieve, calculate and evaluate customer and company information, including to provide insurance quotes, process premium payments, administer our products, provide customer support, file and pay claims and make changes to existing policies, among many other functions. We also use systems for investment management, financial reporting and data analysis to support our policyholder reserves and other actuarial estimates. We have developed or evolved strategies, and processes to secure, maintain and enhance our existing internal networks, technology and processing infrastructure and our information systems and to update or replace certain information systems to keep pace with advancing technology, changing customer preferences and expectations, and increasingly stringent industry and regulatory standards. However, system failures, extended unavailability or other outages, or damage or destruction to internal or external networks or systems, whether caused by intentional or unintentional acts or events, as well as difficulties arising from the implementation of system-security vulnerability patches, third-party system upgrades, and new systems and technologies, could compromise our ability to perform critical functions on a timely basis. For instance, if these systems were inaccessible or inoperable, or if they fail to function effectively or as designed, the resulting disruptions may impede or interrupt our business operations, cause misstated or unreliable financial data, or impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIn certain lines of our business, our information technology and telecommunication systems interface with and rely upon third-party services, over which we have no direct control, including providers of computing infrastructure platforms or externally hosted systems commonly known as the \u201ccloud.\u201d We are highly dependent on our ability to access these external services for necessary business functions, such as acquiring new business, managing existing business, paying claims, and ensuring timely and accurate financial reporting. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor these relationships, if third-party providers do not perform as anticipated, if technological or other problems are incurred with a transition, or if outsourcing relationships relevant to our business process functions are terminated, we may not realize expected productivity improvements or cost-efficiencies, and we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - (Continued)\nWe receive and transmit legally protected information with and among customers, agents, financial institutions and selected third party vendors and service providers, including personally identifiable information and non-public information. We have invested significant time and resources towards preventing and mitigating risks through security vulnerability assessments and several layers of data intrusion and detection protection technologies, designs and authentication capabilities. Our efforts may not be effective against all security threats and breach attempts in light of increasingly complex and persistent threat techniques and the evolving sophistication of individual and state-sponsored cyber-attacks. A breach, whether from external or internal sources, or from the theft or loss of equipment, can result in access, viewing, misappropriation, altering or deleting information in ours or a third party\u2019s systems on which we rely, including customers\u2019, agents\u2019 and employees\u2019 sensitive personal and financial information and our proprietary business information. Like other companies, we have experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and ransomware, seeking to gain unauthorized access to systems and data or to cause disruptions in service. In addition, a limited number of spoofing attacks have been carried out by individuals impersonating customers, which have resulted in unauthorized withdrawals from certain customer accounts. Such withdrawals have been refunded by us, and we believe we have implemented appropriate business process changes to help mitigate future attacks. We are also licensing technology to further assist in the identification of these bad actors. To date, these various threats and attacks have not been material to our operations. However, any significant attacks, unauthorized access or disclosures, disruptions or other security breaches, whether affecting us or third parties, could result in substantial business disruption and consequences, including without limitation, costs of repairing or replacing systems, increased security costs, costs of customer notifications and credit monitoring services, lost revenues, litigation, regulatory action, fines and penalties, and harm to customer and producer confidence and our reputation. While we have purchased cybersecurity risk insurance and intend to assess the adequacy of this insurance annually, this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our losses from breaches of our data.\nCybersecurity risks may also cause an index\u2019s performance to be incorrectly calculated, which could affect the calculation of values under certain of our insurance and annuity contracts. We are not responsible for the calculation of any index. Breaches in cybersecurity may also negatively affect the value of the securities or other investments that comprise or define an index.\nOur failure to complete and implement technology initiatives in a timely manner could result in the loss of business and incurrence of software development costs that may not be recoverable. Data and analytics play an increasingly important role in the insurance industry. We may initiate multi-year technology projects from time to time to enhance operations or replace aging systems. While technology developments can enhance the utility and value of data and analytics, streamline business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives can also present significant economic and organizational challenges, short-term costs and implementation risks. In addition, projections of expenses and implementation schedules could change materially and costs could escalate over time, while the ultimate utility of a technology initiative could deteriorate over time.\nDue to the highly-regulated nature of the insurance industry, we also face increasing costs and competing time constraints in adapting technology to meet compliance requirements of new and proposed regulations. The costs to develop and implement systems to replace our aging systems and to comply with new regulatory requirements as needed over time are expected to be significant. Due to the complexities involved, there can be no assurances that new multi-year projects will be successful and that the costs incurred to develop and implement replacement systems will be recoverable. Furthermore, failure to implement replacement systems in a timely manner could result in loss of business from our delay or inability to design and introduce new insurance products that meet emerging consumer needs and competitive trends.\nEmployee and agent error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significant losses. The actions or inaction of our employees, agents, producers, managing general agents, managing general underwriters and third party administrators could result in losses arising from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to properly document transactions, failure to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to maintain effective internal controls, or failure to comply with underwriting guidelines or regulatory requirements. It is not always possible to deter or prevent misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.\nOur business operations depend on our ability to appropriately distribute, execute and administer our policies and claims. Our primary business is writing and servicing life, annuity, property and casualty, and health insurance for individuals, families and businesses. Any problems or discrepancies that arise in our pricing, underwriting, billing, processing, claims handling or other practices, whether as a result of employee error, vendor error, or technological problems, could have a negative effect on operations and reputation, particularly if such problems or discrepancies are replicated through multiple policies.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - (Continued)\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which may adversely impact our Company.\nIt is necessary for us to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting to prevent fraud and errors and to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures to provide timely and reliable financial and other information. In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we disclosed certain material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. After enhancements to our internal controls, we concluded as of the end of fiscal year 2017 that our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. We have also concluded as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 that our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future material weaknesses or that there are no existing, but as yet undiscovered, weaknesses that we need to address. A failure to maintain adequate internal controls may adversely affect our ability to provide information that accurately reflects our financial condition on a timely basis. This could cause an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and the market price of our stock if investors, customers, rating agencies, regulators or others lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, if we become subject to SEC or other regulatory review and sanctions, or if we become subject to litigation that results in substantial fines, penalties or liabilities.\nCatastrophic Event Risk Factors\nWe may incur significant losses resulting from catastrophic events. Our property and casualty operations are exposed to catastrophes caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, droughts, earthquakes, snow, hail and windstorms, and manmade events, such as terrorism, riots, explosions, hazardous material releases, and utility outages. Our life and health insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or illness, such as a pandemic, an outbreak of an easily communicable disease, or another event that causes a large number of deaths or high morbidity. Our investment operations are exposed to catastrophes as a result of direct investments and mortgages related to real estate. Our operating results may vary significantly from one period to the next since the likelihood, timing, severity, number or type of catastrophe events cannot be accurately predicted. Our losses in connection with catastrophic events are primarily a function of the severity of the event and the amount of our exposure in the affected area.\nThe occurrence of events that are unanticipated in our business continuity and disaster recovery planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively. Our corporate headquarters is located in Galveston, Texas, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and in the past has been impacted by hurricanes. Our League City, Texas, offices are designed to support our operations and service our policyholders in the event of a hurricane or other natural disaster affecting Galveston. The primary offices of our property and casualty insurance companies are in Springfield, Missouri, and Glenmont, New York, which helps to insulate these facilities and their operations from coastal catastrophes. While we periodically test our business continuity and disaster recovery plans, the severity, timing, duration or extent of an event may be unanticipated by such plans, which could result in an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business. In the event a significant number of our employees or agents were unavailable or unable to work following such a disaster, or if our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems were affected, our ability to effectively conduct our business could be compromised.\nClimate change may adversely impact our results of operations.\nThere are concerns that the increased frequency and severity of weather-related catastrophes and other losses, such as wildfires, incurred by the industry in recent years is indicative of changing weather patterns, whether as a result of global climate change caused by human activities or otherwise, which could cause such events to persist. Increased weather-related catastrophes would lead to higher overall losses, which we may not be able to recoup, particularly in a highly regulated and competitive environment, and higher reinsurance costs. Certain catastrophe models assume an increase in frequency and severity of certain weather or other events, which could result in a disproportionate impact on insurers with certain geographic concentrations of risk. This would also likely increase the risks of writing property insurance in coastal areas or areas susceptible to wildfires or flooding, particularly in jurisdictions that restrict pricing and underwriting flexibility. The threat of rising seas or other catastrophe losses as a result of climate change may also cause property values in coastal or such other communities to decrease, reducing the total amount of insurance coverage that is required.\nIn addition, climate change could have an impact on assets in which we invest, resulting in realized and unrealized losses in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial position. It is not possible to foresee which, if any, assets, industries or markets will be materially and adversely affected, nor is it possible to foresee the magnitude of such effect. Moreover, we cannot predict how legal, regulatory and social responses to concerns about global climate change will impact our business or the value of our investments.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - (Continued)\nMarketplace Risk Factors\nOur future results are dependent in part on successfully operating in insurance and annuity industries that are highly competitive with regard to customers and producers. Strong competition for customers has led to increased marketing and advertising by our competitors, many of whom have well-established national reputations and greater financial and marketing resources, as well as the introduction of new insurance products and aggressive pricing. These competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may limit our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. Because of its relatively low cost of entry, the Internet has emerged as a significant place of new competition, both from existing competitors and new competitors. In addition, product development and life-cycles have shortened in many product segments, leading to intense competition with respect to product features.\nWe compete for customers\u2019 funds with a variety of investment products offered by financial services companies other than insurance companies, such as banks, investment advisors, mutual fund companies and other financial institutions. Moreover, customer expectations are evolving as technology advances and consumers become accustomed to enjoying tailored, easy to-use-services and products from various industries. This is reshaping and raising consumer expectations when dealing with insurance. We are addressing these changing consumer expectations by investing in technology with a particular focus on consumer-facing sales and service platforms, by internally promoting a strategically-focused innovative culture initiative, and by creating internal forums to drive next generation solutions based on consumer insights. However, if we cannot effectively respond to increased competition and such increased consumer expectations, we may not be able to grow our business or we may lose market share.\nWe compete with other insurers for producers primarily on the basis of our financial position, reputation, stable ownership, support services, compensation, product features and pricing. We may be unable to compete for producers with insurers that adopt more aggressive pricing or compensation, that offer a broader array of products or packages of products, or that have extensive promotional and advertising campaigns.\nOur supplemental health business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers or changes in federal healthcare policy. Our Medicare Supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior-aged healthcare industry that provide alternatives to traditional Medicare such as HMO and other managed care or private plans. Programs such as Medicare Advantage allow carriers to provide Medicare supplement benefits in a managed care package (i.e. HMO/PPO) that can be tailored to an insured\u2019s state or even region depending on the size of the provider network. The benefit of Medicare Advantage is most people are familiar with how HMO\u2019s and PPO\u2019s operate and how the providers are built in. The success of these alternative healthcare solutions for seniors could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional Medicare Supplement and impact our ability to offer such products. Additionally, other supplemental products in our portfolio, including Short-Term Care and Limited Benefit plans could be impacted by future federal and state legislation. These products are excluded from coverage requirements in the Healthcare Act. They are designed to fill the niche for consumers unable to get full coverage at any given time. State and federal legislation, either through Congress or the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), could impact marketing by enacting laws and regulations restricting these products in the market. Changes to healthcare policy could limit the ability to renew/rewrite, impose limitations on the length of coverage periods or limit benefit amounts available in plans. We do not see major changes in healthcare policy for the remainder of 2020. Even if we assume a change in political power in Washington D.C. after the election, we probably would not see healthcare policy changes until later in 2021.\nLitigation and Regulation Risk Factors\nLitigation may result in significant financial losses and harm our reputation. Plaintiffs have brought and may bring lawsuits, including class actions, against us relating to, among other things, sales or underwriting practices, alleged agent misconduct, product design, product disclosure, product administration, fees charged, denial or delay of benefits, product suitability, claims-handling practices (including the permitted use of aftermarket, non-original equipment manufacturer auto parts), loss valuation methodology, refund practices, employment and producer contracting matters, and breaches of duties to customers. Plaintiffs may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, and our reputation could be harmed. The damages claimed and the amount of any probable and estimable liability, if any, may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Even when successful in the defense of such actions, we incur significant attorneys\u2019 fees, direct litigation costs and substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - (Continued)\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, and potential further regulation may increase our operating costs, restrict our ability to innovate and limit our growth. We are subject to extensive insurance laws and regulations that affect nearly every aspect of our business. We are also subject to additional laws and regulations administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, such as state securities and workforce regulators, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), FINRA, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), HHS, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. We face the risk that any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue may conflict with that of another regulator or enforcement authority or may change over time to our detriment. Regulatory investigations and examinations, which can be broad and unpredictable, may raise issues not identified previously and could result in new legal actions against us and industry-wide regulations that could adversely affect us. Further, we are experiencing increasing information requests from regulators without corresponding direct regulation being applicable to us, on issues such as climate change, diversity and our investments in certain companies or industries. Responding to such requests adds to our compliance burden.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to us are complex and subject to change, and compliance is time consuming and personnel-intensive. Changes in these laws and regulations, or interpretations by courts or regulators, may materially increase our costs of doing business and may result in changes to our practices that may limit our ability to grow and improve our profitability. Regulatory developments or actions against us could have material adverse financial effects and could harm our reputation. Among other things, we could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some or all of our business activities, or made subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities.\nAs insurance industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other conditions outside of our control change, unexpected issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These changes may include modifications to long established business practices or policy interpretations, which may adversely affect us by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the type, number, or size of claims. For example, many states have adopted legislation that is similar to the Model Unclaimed Life Insurance Benefits Act. Such legislation imposes requirements on insurers to periodically compare their life insurance and annuity contracts and retained asset accounts against the U.S. Social Security Administration\u2019s Death Master File, investigate any potential matches, determine whether benefits are payable, and attempt to locate beneficiaries. Some states are attempting to apply these laws retroactively to existing policies. A number of states have aggressively audited life insurance companies, including us and some of our subsidiaries, for compliance with such laws, and more states could do so. Such audits have sought to identify unreported insured deaths and to determine whether any unpaid benefits, proceeds or other payments under life insurance or annuity contracts should be treated as unclaimed property to be escheated to the state. We have modified our claims process to stay current with emerging trends. It is possible that such audits may result in regulatory actions, litigation, administrative fines and penalties, interest, and additional changes to our procedures.\nIn January 2019, the NYDFS issued Circular Letter No. 1, in which the department set out its views concerning the use of external consumer data sources in the underwriting of life insurance. The NYDFS contends that external data sources can be unreliable and that many are not subject to regulatory oversight. Circular Letter No. 1 further highlights two particular areas of immediate concern for the NYDFS involving the use of external data sources by life insurers. First, the department states that the use of external data sources has a significant potential to negatively impact protected classes of consumers in violation of state and federal anti-discrimination laws, and that insurers should not use an external data source unless the insurer can prove that such source does not violate anti-discrimination laws. Second, the NYDFS contends that an insurer\u2019s use of external data sources is often accompanied by a lack of transparency to consumers, which may implicate unfair trade practice law. Such guidance, or similar guidance adopted by other states, may significantly hinder our use of technological and innovative advances to underwrite and price life insurance accurately. This guidance may also deter the use of what is commonly called \u201cbig data\u201d in the underwriting of property and casualty insurance.\nFederal regulatory changes and initiatives have a growing impact on us. For example, Dodd-Frank provides for enhanced federal oversight of the financial services industry through multiple initiatives. Provisions of Dodd-Frank are or may become applicable to us, our competitors, or certain entities with which we do business. For example, it is possible that regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) may extend, or be interpreted to extend, to the sale of certain insurance products by covered financial institutions, which could adversely affect sales of such products. The Federal Insurance Office, as a result of various studies it conducts, may also recommend changes in laws or regulations that affect our business. Although there have been proposals to revise or reverse some provisions of Dodd-Frank, the fate of such proposals is unclear, and we cannot predict with certainty how Dodd-Frank will continue to affect the financial markets generally or impact our business and results of operations.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - (Continued)\nCertain federal regulation may impact our property and casualty operations. In 2013, under the Obama Administration, HUD finalized a regulation under the Fair Housing Act that applies to home lenders, landlords and other housing providers. Such regulation prohibits lending and housing practices having a disparate impact against protected classes, even if there is no intent to discriminate. Various legal challenges to this regulation were pursued, culminating in a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 generally viewed as favorable to the regulation. More recently, the Trump Administration sought delay and reconsideration of the 2013 regulation. As a result, HUD has proposed a regulation that would substantially revise the 2013 regulation to make it more difficult for plaintiffs to bring disparate impact claims under the Fair Housing Act. Nevertheless, there is still concern among property and casualty insurers that the 2013 regulation, whether or not revised, could be applied in a manner that adversely impacts price differentiation for homeowners\u2019 policies using traditional risk selection analysis. Further, it is uncertain to what extent the regulation may impact property and casualty industry underwriting practices. The proposed regulation, whether or not adopted in its present form, could increase litigation costs, force changes in underwriting practices, and impair our ability to write homeowners business profitably. In addition, Congress or states may enact legislation affecting insurers\u2019 ability to use credit-based insurance scores as part of the property and casualty underwriting or rating process, which could force changes in underwriting practices and impair our property and casualty operations\u2019 ability to write homeowners business profitably.\nThere have been federal efforts to change the standards of care applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers. We have previously reported that in April 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) issued a regulation that significantly expanded the range of activities considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cfiduciary rule\u201d). The fiduciary rule would have applied ERISA\u2019s fiduciary standard to many insurance agents, broker-dealers, advisers and others not previously subject to the standard when they sell annuities to IRA\u2019s and qualified retirement plans. The fiduciary rule ultimately was vacated on June 21, 2018, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ending the rule's effectiveness. However, there are indications that the DOL may propose an alternative rule.\nWe have previously reported that in April 2018, the SEC proposed a regulation addressing the standards of care applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers. \u201cRegulation Best Interest\u201d would require a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. On June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest. The rule will require broker-dealers and investment advisers to provide retail customers a Client Relationship Summary (\u201cForm CRS\u201d) to disclose certain information about the nature of the customer\u2019s relationship with their investment professional, including fees and costs associated with services and conflicts of interest the firm may have. Broker-dealers and investment advisers must begin complying with Regulation Best Interest and the Form CRS requirements by June 30, 2020.\nThere have also been state efforts to change the standards of care applicable to broker-dealers, investment advisers and insurance producers, including through the NAIC's Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation and the \u201cSuitability and Best Interests in Life Insurance and Annuity Transactions\u201d regulation adopted by the NYDFS. The NAIC model regulation places suitability responsibilities on insurance companies in the sale of fixed and indexed annuities, including responsibilities for training agents. The NAIC recently has adopted revisions to this model regulation that would further elevate the standard of care for annuity sales and harmonize it with the SEC's new Regulation Best Interest. We anticipate that the revised model will be adopted in some form by many of the states in which we do business. The NYDFS regulation addresses the duties and obligations of insurers and their producers and provides that any transactions with respect to life insurance policies and annuity contracts delivered or issued for delivery in New York must be in the best interest of the consumer and appropriately address the insurance needs and financial objectives of the consumer at the time of the transaction. It further requires that any recommendation must be based on an evaluation of the suitability information of the consumer and reflect the care, skill, prudence and diligence that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use under the prevailing circumstances. Further, a producer\u2019s compensation and other incentives must not influence his or her recommendations. The New York regulation became effective for annuity products on August 1, 2019 and for life insurance products on February 1, 2020.\nAll or any of the above-described federal and state efforts to address the standards of care applicable to broker-dealers, investment advisers and insurance producers could materially affect how our life insurance and annuity products are designed, marketed and serviced. We may find it necessary to change our producer compensation practices, limit the assistance producers can provide to contract owners, replace or engage additional producers, or otherwise change how we design and support sales of our annuities. Any of these regulatory or legislative measures, or judicial rulings regarding the same, or consumer and producer reaction to such measures, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell annuities and certain other products and to retain in-force business.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - (Continued)\nLastly, international standards continue to emerge in response to the globalization of the insurance industry and evolving standards of regulation, privacy, solvency measurement and risk management. Any international conventions or mandates that directly or indirectly impact or influence the nature of U.S. regulation or industry operations could negatively affect us.\nFor further discussions of the kinds of regulation applicable to us, see Item 1, Business, Regulations Applicable to Our Business section.\nChanges in tax laws could adversely affect our business. Under current U.S. federal and state income tax laws, certain products we offer, primarily life insurance and annuities, receive tax treatment designed to encourage consumers to purchase these products. This treatment may encourage some consumers to select our products over non-insurance products. The U.S. Congress from time to time may consider legislation that would change the taxation of insurance products and/or reduce the taxation of competing products. Such legislation, if adopted, could materially change consumer behavior, which may harm our ability to sell such products and result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the U.S. federal and state estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning. Uncertainty regarding the tax structure in the future may also cause some current or future purchasers to delay or indefinitely postpone the purchase of products we offer.\nOn December 22, 2017, the federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Reform\u201d). Tax Reform made broad and complex changes to federal corporate tax law and resulted in changes to our overall tax obligations. Most notably, Tax Reform reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, there were several changes that are specific to insurance companies, namely changes to the proration formula used to determine the amount of dividends eligible for the dividends-received deduction and changes to the calculation of tax reserves associated with policyholder liabilities. Any changes in federal income tax laws or regulations, including changes to Tax Reform could adversely affect the federal income taxation of our ongoing operations and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nNew accounting rules or changes to existing accounting rules could negatively impact our business. We are required to comply with GAAP. A number of organizations are instrumental in the development and interpretation of GAAP, such as the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. GAAP is subject to review by these organizations and others and is, therefore, subject to change in ways that could change the current accounting treatments we apply.\nWe also must comply with Statutory Accounting Principles (\u201cSAP\u201d) in our insurance operations. SAP and various components of SAP (such as actuarial reserving methodology) are subject to review by the NAIC and its taskforces and committees, as well as state insurance departments.\nFuture changes to GAAP or SAP could impact our product profitability, reserve and capital requirements, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 3, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion regarding the impact of the recently issued accounting pronouncements and the future adoption of new accounting standards on the Company.\nReinsurance and Counterparty Risk Factors\nReinsurance may not be available, affordable, adequate or collectible to protect us against losses. As part of our risk management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks that we underwrite. Market conditions, catastrophes, and geo-political events beyond our control, including the continued threat of terrorism, influence the availability and cost of reinsurance for new business. In certain circumstances, the price of existing reinsurance contracts may also increase. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or they may not pay these balances on a timely basis.\nThe counterparties to derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks could default or fail to perform. We enter into derivative contracts, such as options, with a number of counterparties to hedge various business risks. If our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations, our economic hedges of the related risks will be ineffective. Such counterparty failures could have a material adverse effect on us. See Note 7, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - (Continued)\nOther Risk Factors\nOur financial strength ratings could be downgraded. Various Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (\u201cNRSROs\u201d) publish financial strength ratings as their opinion of an insurance company\u2019s creditworthiness and ability to meet policyholder and contractholder obligations. As with other rated companies, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any NRSRO. A downgrade or an announced potential downgrade of our financial strength ratings could have multiple adverse effects on us including:\n\u2022\nreducing new sales of insurance and annuity products or increasing the number or amount of surrenders and withdrawals;\n\u2022\naffecting our relationships with our sales force, independent sales intermediaries and credit counterparties;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to offer higher crediting rates or greater policyholder guarantees on our insurance products in order to remain competitive; and\n\u2022\naffecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices.\nIt is likely that the NRSROs will continue to apply a high level of scrutiny to financial institutions, including us and our competitors, and may adjust the capital, risk management and other requirements employed in the NRSRO models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.\nWe are controlled by a small number of stockholders. As of December 31, 2019, the Moody Foundation, a charitable trust, beneficially owned approximately 22.75% of our common stock. In addition, Moody National Bank, in its capacity as trustee or agent of various accounts, had the power to vote approximately 49.07% of our common stock as of such date. As a result, subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements, these institutions have the ability to exercise a controlling influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval, including the composition of our Board of Directors, and through the Board of Directors any determination with respect to our business direction and policies. This concentration of voting power could deter a change of control or other business combination that might be beneficial or preferable to other stockholders. It may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock if controlling stockholders sell a significant number of shares or if investors perceive disadvantages in owning stock in a company controlled by a small number of stockholders.\nAdvances in medical technology may adversely affect our business. Genetic testing and diagnostic imaging technology is advancing rapidly. Increases in the prevalence, availability (particularly in the case of direct to consumer genetic testing) and accuracy of such testing may increase our adverse selection risk, as people who learn that they are predisposed to certain medical conditions associated with reduced life expectancy may be more likely to purchase and maintain life insurance. Conversely, people who learn that they lack genetic predisposition to conditions associated with reduced life expectancy may forego the purchase of life insurance, or permit existing policies to lapse, and may be more likely to purchase certain annuity products. Our access to and ability to use medical information, including the results of genetic and diagnostic testing, that is known to our prospective policyholders is important to our underwriting of life insurance and annuities. Some states restrict insurers\u2019 access and use of genetic information, and similar additional regulations and legislation may be adopted. Such regulation and legislation likely would exacerbate adverse risk selection related to genetic and diagnostic testing.\nIn addition to earlier diagnosis and knowledge of disease risk, medical advances may increase overall health and longevity. If this were to occur, the duration of payments made under certain of our annuity products would be extended beyond our actuarial assumptions, reducing the profitability of such business. This may require us to modify our assumptions, models or reserves.\nSee also Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for additional details regarding certain risks that we face.", "PERMNO": 13507, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "ANAT"}
