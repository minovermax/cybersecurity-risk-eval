Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur operating results are heavily dependent on sales of our influenza diagnostic tests.\nAlthough we continue to diversify our products, a significant percentage of our total revenues still continue to come from a limited number of our product families. In particular, revenues from the sale of our influenza tests represent a significant portion of our total revenues and are expected to remain so for at least the near future. In addition, the gross margins derived from sales of our influenza tests are significantly higher than the gross margins from many of our other core products. As a result, if sales or revenues of our influenza tests decline for any reason whether as a result of market share loss or price pressure, obsolescence, a mild flu season, regulatory matters or any other reason our operating results would be materially and adversely affected on a disproportionate basis. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, sales of our infectious disease products (including influenza test sales) accounted for 71%, 73%, and 71% respectively, of total revenue.\nOur operating results may fluctuate adversely as a result of many factors that are outside our control, which may negatively impact our stock price.\nFluctuations in our operating results, for any reason, could cause our growth or operating results to fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts.\nWe base the scope of our operations and related expenses on our estimates of future revenues. A significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, and we may not be able to rapidly adjust our expenses if our revenues fall short of our expectations. Our revenue estimates for future periods are based, among other factors, on estimated end-user demand for our products. If end-user consumption is less than estimated, revenues from our distribution partners and other distribution channels would be expected to fall short of expectations, and because such a significant portion of our costs are fixed, could result in operating losses.\nFactors that are beyond our control and that could affect our operating results in the future include:\n\u2022\ntiming of the onset, length and severity of the cold and flu seasons;\n\u2022\nseasonal fluctuations in our sales of infectious disease tests, which are generally highest in fall and winter, thus resulting in generally lower operating results in the second and third calendar quarters and higher operating results in the first and fourth calendar quarters;\n\u2022\ngovernment and media attention focused on influenza and the related potential impact on humans from novel influenza viruses, such as H1N1 and avian flu;\n\u2022\nchanges in the level of competition, such as would occur if one of our competitors introduced a new, better performing or lower priced product to compete with one or more of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in the reimbursement systems or reimbursement amounts that end-users may rely upon in choosing to use our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions in our domestic and international markets, such as economic downturns, decreased healthcare spending, reduced consumer demand, inflation and currency fluctuations; changes in government laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated market penetration of our new or more recently introduced products;\n\u2022\nsignificant quantities of our product or that of our competitors in our distributors\u2019 inventories or distribution channels;\n\u2022\nchanges in distributor buying patterns; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the healthcare market including consolidation in our customer base.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to develop, obtain and protect our proprietary technology rights; otherwise, we may lose market share or need to reduce prices as a result of competitors selling technologically superior products that compete with our products.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the diagnostic market depends on continued development and introduction of new proprietary technology and the improvement of existing technology. If we cannot continue to improve upon or develop, obtain and protect proprietary technology, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur competitive position is heavily dependent on obtaining and protecting our own proprietary technology or obtaining licenses from others. Our ability to obtain patents and licenses, and their benefits, is uncertain.\n\u2022\nWe have issued patents both in the U.S. and internationally, with expiration dates ranging from the present through approximately 2034. In addition to our patents in the U.S., we have patents issued in various other countries including, among others, Australia, Canada, Japan and various European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Additionally, we have patent applications pending in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. These pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents, or if issued, may not have priority over others\u2019 applications or may not offer meaningful protection against competitors with similar technology or may not otherwise provide commercial value. Moreover, any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, found unenforceable or circumvented in the future. Third parties can make, use and sell products covered by our patents in any country in which we do not have patent protection.\n\u2022\nWe also license the right to use our products to our customers under label licenses that are for research purposes only. These licenses could be contested and, because we cannot monitor all potential unauthorized uses of our products around the world, we might not be aware of an unauthorized use or might not be able to enforce the license restrictions in a cost-effective manner.\n\u2022\nOur current and future licenses may not be adequate for the operation of our business. In the future, we expect that we will require or desire additional licenses from other parties in order to refine our products further and to allow us to develop, manufacture and market commercially viable or superior products. We may not be able to obtain licenses for technology patented by others and required to produce our products on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nTo protect or enforce our patent rights, it may be necessary for us to initiate patent litigation proceedings against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. These lawsuits would be expensive, take significant time and would divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In the event that we seek to enforce any of our patents against an infringing party, it is likely that the party defending the claim will seek to invalidate the patents we assert, which could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not being issued. Further, these lawsuits may provoke the defendants to assert claims against us. If we pursue any such claim, we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of such suits or proceedings or that the damages or other remedies awarded to us, if any, will be economically valuable.\nIn addition to our patents, we rely on confidentiality agreements and other similar arrangements with our employees and other persons who have access to our proprietary and confidential information, together with trade secrets and other common law rights, to protect our proprietary and confidential technology. These agreements and laws may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information or in the event that our competitors independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as those in the U.S. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information, if we encounter difficulties or are otherwise unable to effectively protect our intellectual property rights domestically or in foreign jurisdictions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn order to remain competitive and profitable, we must expend considerable resources to research new technologies and products and develop new markets, and there is no assurance our efforts to develop new technologies, products or markets will be successful or such technologies, products or markets will be commercially viable.\nWe devote a significant amount of financial and other resources to researching and developing new technologies, new products and new markets. The development, manufacture and sale of diagnostic products requires a significant investment of resources. The development of new markets also requires a substantial investment of resources, such as new employees, offices and manufacturing facilities. No assurances can be given that our efforts to develop new technologies or products will be successful, that such technologies and products will be commercially viable, or our expansion into new markets will be profitable.\nWe expect to incur significant operating expenses as a result of continued investment in sales and marketing activities, manufacturing scale-up and new product development associated with our efforts to accomplish our business strategies discussed in \u201cBusiness - Business Strategy\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our operational, growth and other strategic efforts. In addition, the funds for our strategic development projects have in the past come primarily from our business operations, borrowings under available lines of credit and the sale of equity or debt securities. If our business slows and we become less profitable, and as a result have less money\navailable to fund research and development, we may have to reduce or eliminate programs. Similarly, if adequate financial, personnel, equipment or other resources are not available, we may be required to delay or scale back our strategic efforts.\nOur operations will be adversely affected if our operating results do not correspondingly increase with our increased expenditures or if our technology, product and market development efforts are unsuccessful or delayed. Furthermore, our failure to successfully introduce new technologies or products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe rely on a limited number of key distributors that account for a substantial majority of our total revenue. The loss of any key distributor or an unsuccessful effort by us to directly distribute our products could lead to reduced sales.\nAlthough we have many distributor relationships in the U.S., the market is dominated by a small number of these distributors. Three of our distributors, which are considered to be among the market leaders, collectively accounted (each individually in excess of 10%) for approximately 44%, 48%, and 48% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, we rely on a few key distributors for a majority of our international sales, and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The loss or termination of our relationship with any of these key distributors could significantly disrupt our business unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales to one distributor are absorbed by another distributor. Finding a suitable alternative to a lost or terminated distributor may pose challenges in our industry\u2019s competitive environment, and another suitable distributor may not be found on satisfactory terms, if at all. For instance, some distributors already have exclusive arrangements with our competitors, and others do not have the same level of penetration into our target markets as our existing distributors. If total revenue from these or any of our other significant distributors were to decrease in any material amount in the future or we are not successful in timely transitioning business to new distributors, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to manage our growth strategy or if we experience difficulties identifying or integrating companies or technologies we may acquire, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy contemplates further growth, which would likely result in expanding the scope of operating and financial systems and the geographical area of our operations, including further expansion outside the U.S., as new products and technologies are developed and commercialized or new geographical markets are entered. Because we have a relatively small executive staff, acquisitions and other future growth may divert management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business, and place a strain on existing management and our operational, financial and management information systems. Furthermore, we may expand into markets in which we have less experience or incur higher costs. Some of our growth is expected to come from acquisitions of businesses and technologies. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Additionally, we may experience difficulties integrating the operations of companies or technologies that we may acquire, with our own operations, and we may not realize our anticipated benefits and cost savings within our expected time frame, or at all. We can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify, complete and integrate strategic acquisitions. Should we encounter difficulties in managing these tasks and risks, our growth strategy may suffer and our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nIntellectual property risks and third-party claims of infringement, misappropriation of proprietary rights or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products, require us to redesign our products or attempt to seek licenses from third parties, and materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the defense of such claims could result in significant costs and divert the attention of our management and other key employees.\nCompanies in or related to our industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. There are often intellectual property risks associated with developing and producing new products and entering new markets, and we may not be able to obtain, at reasonable cost or upon commercially reasonable terms, if at all, licenses to intellectual property of others that is alleged to be part of such new or existing products. From time to time, we have received, and may continue to receive, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 proprietary rights.\nWe have hired and will continue to hire individuals or contractors who have experience in medical diagnostics and these individuals or contractors may have confidential trade secret or proprietary information of third parties. We cannot assure you that these individuals or contractors will not use this third-party information in connection with performing services for us or otherwise reveal this third-party information to us. Thus, we could be sued for misappropriation of proprietary information and trade secrets. Such claims are expensive to defend and could divert our attention and result in substantial damage awards and injunctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, to\nthe extent that individuals or contractors apply technical or scientific information independently developed by them to our projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such data and may result in litigation.\nMoreover, in the past we have been engaged in litigation with parties that claim, among other matters, that we infringed their patents. The defense and prosecution of patent and trade secret claims are both costly and time consuming. We or our customers may be sued by other parties that claim that our products have infringed their patents or misappropriated their proprietary rights or that may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents. An adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products, limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved with such products may perform for us, increase our costs and expose us to significant liability.\nAs a general matter, our involvement in litigation or in any claims to determine proprietary rights, as may arise from time to time, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations for reasons such as:\n\u2022\npending litigation may of itself cause our distributors or end-users to reduce or terminate purchases of our products;\n\u2022\nit may consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources;\n\u2022\nits outcome would be uncertain and a court may find any third-party patent claims valid and infringed by our products (issuing a preliminary or permanent injunction) that would require us to procure costly licensing arrangements from third parties or withdraw or recall such products from the market, redesign such products offered for sale or under development or restrict employees from performing work in their areas of expertise;\n\u2022\ngovernmental agencies may commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees, former employees and us relating to claims of misappropriation or misuse of another party\u2019s proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nan adverse outcome could subject us to significant liability in the form of past royalty payments, penalties, special and punitive damages, the opposing party\u2019s attorneys' fees, and future royalty payments significantly affecting our future earnings; and\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain a necessary license (upon commercially reasonable terms, if at all) upon an adverse outcome could prevent us from selling our current products or other products we may develop.\nEven if licenses to intellectual property rights are available, they can be costly. We have entered into various licensing agreements, which largely require payments based on specified product sales as well as the achievement of specific milestones. Royalty and license expenses under these arrangements collectively totaled $0.8 million, $1.1 million and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn addition to the foregoing, we may also be required to indemnify some customers, distributors and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another person\u2019s proprietary rights. Further, our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors, suppliers or customers. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Our contractors, suppliers and licensors may not be required or financially able to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount, above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our Convertible Senior Notes, purchase the Convertible Senior Notes as required upon a fundamental change or service or repay the Convertible Notes at maturity, and potential future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or purchase of our Convertible Senior Notes.\nFollowing a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture to our Convertible Senior Notes), the holders of our Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes for cash. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, unless we settle our conversion obligation solely in shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Senior Notes being surrendered for conversion. We may not have sufficient financial resources, or be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price in cash with respect to any Convertible Senior Notes surrendered by holders for purchase upon a fundamental change or make cash payments upon conversions. Our failure to purchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon a fundamental change or make cash payments upon conversions thereof when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Convertible Senior Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other then-existing indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods,\nwe may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Convertible Senior Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nIn addition, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service or repay our debt. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our Convertible Senior Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Senior Notes will be entitled to convert their Convertible Senior Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more Convertible Senior Note holders elects to convert their notes, unless we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, we would be required to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Furthermore, even if Convertible Senior Note holders did not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Senior Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nWe will continue to have the ability to incur debt and our levels of debt may affect our operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. Our indebtedness could be costly or have adverse consequences, such as:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt obligations and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to adverse conditions in the general economy or our industry and to fluctuations in our operating results, including affecting our ability to comply with and maintain any financial tests and ratios required under our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility to engage in certain transactions or to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the diagnostics industry;\n\u2022\nputting us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less relative and/or less restrictive debt; and\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to additional restrictive financial and other covenants.\nIf we incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, these higher levels of indebtedness may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on existing indebtedness and our creditworthiness generally.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital or operating needs, which could have adverse consequences on our operations and the interests of our stockholders.\nSeasonal fluctuations in our operating results could limit the cash we have available for research and development and other operating needs. As a result, we may need to seek to raise funds through public or private debt or sale of equity to achieve our business strategy. In addition, we may need funds to complete acquisitions, or may issue equity in connection with acquisitions. If we raise funds or acquire other technologies or businesses through issuance of equity, this could dilute the interests of our stockholders. Moreover, the availability of additional capital, whether debt or equity from private capital sources (including banks) or the public capital markets, fluctuates as our financial condition and industry or market conditions in general change. There may be times when the private capital markets and the public debt or equity markets lack sufficient liquidity or when our securities cannot be sold at attractive prices, in which case we would not be able to access capital from these sources on favorable terms, if at all. We can give no assurance as to the terms or availability of additional capital.\nOur results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected by the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers.\nIf our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, our customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us, and our suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms or reduce or terminate production of products they supply to us. Any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services, or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, both state and federal government sponsored and private payers, as a result of budget deficits or reductions, may seek to reduce their healthcare expenditures by renegotiating their contracts with us. Any reduction in payments by such government sponsored or private payers may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Declining economic conditions may also increase our costs.\nWe may not achieve market acceptance of our products among healthcare providers and physicians, and this would have a negative effect on future sales.\nA large part of our business is based on the sale of rapid POC diagnostic tests. Our future sales depend on, among other matters, capture of sales from central laboratories by achieving market acceptance of POC testing from physicians and other healthcare providers. If we do not capture sales at the levels anticipated in our budget, our total revenue will not be at the levels that we expect and the costs we incur or have incurred will be disproportionate to our sales levels. We expect that clinical reference and hospital-based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our POC diagnostic products in order to maintain and expand their existing dominance of the overall diagnostic testing market. Moreover, even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost-effective, save time, or have better performance, physicians and other healthcare providers may resist changing to POC tests. We also believe that adoption of some of our products may be faster if the products are granted a CLIA waiver. On January 30, 2008, the FDA issued guidance setting forth new requirements for obtaining a CLIA waiver that are onerous and have increased the time and cost required to obtain a CLIA waiver. Our failure to achieve market acceptance from physicians and healthcare providers with respect to the use of our POC diagnostic products would have a negative effect on our future sales.\nThe industry and market segment in which we operate are highly competitive, and intense competition with other providers of diagnostic products may reduce our sales and margins.\nOur diagnostic tests compete with similar products made by our competitors. There are a large number of multinational and regional competitors making investments in competing technologies and products, including several large pharmaceutical and diversified healthcare companies. We also face competition from our distributors as some have created, and others may decide to create, their own products to compete with ours. A number of our competitors have a potential competitive advantage because they have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources, and larger, more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than we have. Moreover, some competitors offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we have. If our competitors\u2019 products are more effective than ours or take market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets over the last few years. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry. We expect this trend toward industry consolidation may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations.\nOur business and products are highly regulated by various governmental agencies. Our results of operations would be negatively affected by failures or delays in the receipt of regulatory approvals or clearances, the loss of previously received approvals or other changes to the existing laws and regulations that adversely impact our ability to manufacture and market our products.\nThe testing, manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S., principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. The FDA regulates most of our products, which are currently all Class I or II devices. The U.S. Department of Agriculture regulates our veterinary products. Our future performance depends on, among other matters, if, when and at what cost we will receive regulatory approval for new products. Regulatory review can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, making the timing and costs of clearances and approvals difficult to predict. In addition, certain of our foreign product registrations are owned or controlled by our international distribution partners, such that any change in our arrangement with such partners could result in the loss of or delay in transfer of any such product registrations, thereby interrupting our ability to sell our products in those markets. Our results of operations would be negatively affected by failures or delays in the receipt of regulatory approvals or clearances, the loss of previously\nreceived approvals or clearances or the placement of limits on the marketing and use of our products. For example, the FDA has recently reclassified rapid influenza detection devices from Class I to Class II devices effective February 13, 2017. If such reclassifications affect our ability to market one or more of our rapid influenza products, our total revenue may be negatively affected. Furthermore, in the ordinary course of business, we must frequently make subjective judgments with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If regulators subsequently disagree with the manner in which we have sought to comply with these regulations, we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as field corrective actions, product recall, seizure or injunction with respect to the sale of our products. The assessment of any civil and criminal penalties against us could severely impair our reputation within the industry and affect our operating results, and any limitation on our ability to manufacture and market our products could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in government policy could adversely affect our business and profitability.\nChanges in government policy could have a significant impact on our business by increasing the cost of doing business, affecting our ability to sell our products and negatively impacting our profitability. Such changes could include modifications to existing legislation, such as U.S. tax policy, or entirely new legislation, such as the Affordable Healthcare Act (\"AHA\") in the U.S. Although we cannot fully predict the many ways that healthcare reform might affect our business, the AHA imposed a 2.3% medical device excise tax (\"MDET\") on certain transactions, including many U.S. sales of medical devices, which includes the majority of our US product sales. This tax took effect January 1, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $2.1 million related to the MDET, and although the MDET was suspended for 2016 and 2017, it may be reinstated in 2018 or beyond. It is unclear whether and to what extent, if at all, other anticipated developments, including changes due to new presidential administration priorities, or changes resulting from healthcare reform, such as a change in the number of people with health insurance, may impact us.\nWe are subject to numerous government regulations in addition to FDA regulation, and compliance with laws, including changed or new laws, could increase our costs and adversely affect our operations.\nIn addition to FDA and other regulations referred to above, numerous laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, data privacy, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances impact our business operations. If these laws or their interpretation change or new laws regulating any of our businesses are adopted, the costs of compliance with these laws could substantially increase our overall costs. Failure to comply with any laws, including laws regulating the manufacture and marketing of our products, could result in substantial costs and loss of sales or customers. Because of the number and extent of the laws and regulations affecting our industry, and the number of governmental agencies whose actions could affect our operations, it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of future legislation or regulatory developments relating to our industry and our products. To the extent the costs and procedures associated with meeting new or changing requirements are substantial, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business that may result in unexpected and substantial claims against us relating to handling, storage or disposal.\nOur research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. These regulations include federal statutes commonly known as CERCLA, RCRA and the Clean Water Act. Compliance with these laws and regulations is already expensive. If any governmental authorities were to impose new environmental regulations requiring compliance in addition to that required by existing regulations, or alter their interpretation of the requirements of such existing regulations, such environmental regulations could impair our research, development or production efforts by imposing additional, and possibly substantial, costs, restrictions or compliance procedures on our business. In addition, because of the nature of the penalties provided for in some of these environmental regulations, we could be required to pay sizable fines, penalties or damages in the event of noncompliance with environmental laws. Any environmental violation or remediation requirement could also partially or completely shut down our research and manufacturing facilities and operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated and exposure of individuals to these materials could result in substantial fines, penalties or damages that are not covered by insurance.\nOur total revenue could be affected by third-party reimbursement policies and potential cost constraints.\nThe end-users of our products are primarily physicians and other healthcare providers. In the U.S., healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third-party payers, principally private health insurance plans, federal Medicare and state Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure. Use of our products would be adversely impacted if physicians and other healthcare providers do not receive adequate reimbursement for\nthe cost of our products by their patients\u2019 third-party payers. Our total revenue could also be adversely affected by changes or trends in reimbursement policies of these governmental or private healthcare payers. We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry, both foreign and domestic, to reduce the cost of products and services. Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the U.S. in recent years, currently available levels of reimbursement may not continue to be available in the future for our existing products or products under development. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or foreign markets, current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payers may reduce the demand for our products or adversely impact our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nUnexpected increases in, or inability to meet, demand for our products could require us to spend considerable resources to meet the demand or harm our reputation and customer relationships if we are unable to meet demand.\nOur inability to meet customer demand for our products, whether as a result of manufacturing problems or supply shortfalls, could harm our customer relationships and impair our reputation within the industry. In addition, our product manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or more of our manufacturing sites. Weather, natural disasters (including pandemics), fires, terrorism, political change, failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we experience unexpected increases in the demand for our products, we may be required to expend additional capital resources to meet these demands. These capital resources could involve the cost of new machinery or even the cost of new manufacturing facilities. This would increase our capital costs, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash resources. If we are unable to develop or obtain necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner, our total revenue could be adversely affected. Failure to cost-effectively increase production volumes, if required, or lower than anticipated yields or production problems, including those encountered as a result of changes that we may make in our manufacturing processes to meet increased demand or changes in applicable laws and regulations, could result in shipment delays as well as increased manufacturing costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nUnexpected increases in demand for our products could also require us to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet the demand. Some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and we may not be able to timely access sufficient raw materials in the event of an unexpected increase in demand, particularly those obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers.\nInterruptions in the supply of raw materials and other products and services could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for some of our products, or components and materials used in our products. Some of our raw materials, equipment and components are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have long-term supply agreements with many of these suppliers, but these long-term agreements involve risks for us, such as our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of quality raw materials, equipment or components and our reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. It is also possible that one or more of these suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver materials or components to us. In addition, due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost. Any shortfall in our supply of raw materials, equipment or components, or our inability to quickly and cost-effectively obtain alternative sources for this supply, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn addition, we use third party packaging companies to ship our products to customers. An interruption in the businesses of these third party packaging companies could result in a delay of shipments to customers.\nIf one or more of our products is claimed to be defective, we could be subject to claims of liability and harm to our reputation that could adversely affect our business.\nA claim of a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injuries and otherwise. Any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial conditions and the damage to our reputation or product lines in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to business risk which, if not covered by insurance, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face a number of business risks, including exposure to product liability claims. Although we maintain insurance for a number of these risks, we may face claims for types of damages, or for amounts of damages, that are not covered by our insurance. For example, although we currently carry product liability insurance for liability losses, there is a risk that product liability or other claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policy. Also, our existing insurance may not be renewed at the same cost and level of coverage as currently in effect, or may not be renewed at all. Further, we do not currently have insurance against many environmental risks we confront in our business. If we are held liable for a claim against which we are not insured or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage, whether arising out of product liability matters, cybersecurity matters, or from some other matter, that claim could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFailures in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs.\nWe utilize complex information technology systems to support our business and process, transmit, and store information, including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information. In addition, some of our products include information technology that collects data regarding patients on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes. We cannot be sure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that necessary upgrades will operate as designed, which could result in excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business. In particular, any disruptions, delays or deficiencies caused by our enterprise resource planning system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. In addition, despite the implementation of security measures, information technology systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts, terrorism and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data, could result in a material disruption in our operations. Furthermore, to the extent that any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could face a variety of negative consequences, including regulatory actions or litigation, fines or penalties, adverse publicity, increased cybersecurity protection costs, and lost revenue.\nOur business could be negatively affected by the loss of or the inability to hire key personnel.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to retain our key technical, sales, marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify and hire additional qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, both in the industry in which we operate and where our operations are located. Further, we expect to grow our operations, and our needs for additional management and other key personnel are expected to increase. If we are not able to retain existing key personnel, or timely identify and hire replacement or additional qualified personnel to meet expected growth, our business could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of any of our key personnel, particularly key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development, operation or strategic objectives.\nWe face risks relating to our international sales, including inherent economic, political and regulatory risks, which could impact our financial performance, cause interruptions in our current business operations and impede our growth strategy.\nOur products are sold internationally, with the majority of our international sales to our customers in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We currently sell and market our products through distributor organizations and sales agents. Sales to foreign customers accounted for 17%, 14%, and 13% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our international sales are subject to inherent economic, political and regulatory risks, which could impact our financial performance, cause interruptions in our current business operations and impede our international growth. These foreign risks include, among others:\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple different registration requirements and new and changing registration requirements, our inability to benefit from registration for our products inasmuch as registrations may be controlled by a distributor, and the difficulty in transitioning our product registrations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including U.S. laws such as import/export limitations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws\nprohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, could expose us or our employees to fines and criminal sanctions and damage our reputation;\n\u2022\ntariffs or other barriers as we continue to expand into new countries and geographic regions;\n\u2022\nexposure to currency exchange fluctuations against the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles, generally lower average selling prices and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;\n\u2022\nreduced, or lack of, protection for, and enforcement of, intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability in some of the regions where we currently sell our products or that we may expand into in the future;\n\u2022\ncomplex and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\ndiversion to the U.S. of our products sold into international markets at lower prices.\nCurrently, the majority of our international sales are negotiated for and paid in U.S. dollars. Nonetheless, these sales are subject to currency risks, since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the U.S. dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive. These exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products, as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets. In order to maintain a competitive price for our products internationally, we may have to continue to provide discounts or otherwise effectively reduce our prices, resulting in a lower margin on products sold internationally. Continued change in the values of the Euro, the Japanese Yen and other foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have certain supply agreements with foreign vendors whereby we share the foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk. We may, in the future, enter into similar arrangements.\nSales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of our securities.\nWe may need to seek additional capital. If this additional financing is obtained through the issuance of equity securities, debt convertible into equity or options or warrants to acquire equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution upon the issuance, conversion or exercise of such securities. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the conversion of our Convertible Senior Notes, exercise of stock options and vesting of other equity awards.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or issuances of additional securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock or other equity linked securities, including, convertible debt, preferred stock or warrants, could dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders and could depress the market price of shares of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock.\nWe also have a number of institutional stockholders that own significant blocks of our common stock. If one or more of these stockholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nThe price of our stock may fluctuate unpredictably in response to factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nThe stock market periodically experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to drop. In particular, the market price of securities of smaller medical device companies, like ours, has been very unpredictable and may vary in response to:\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors concerning technological innovations;\n\u2022\nintroductions of new products;\n\u2022\nFDA and foreign regulatory actions;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes relating to patents or proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in healthcare policy in the U.S. or other countries; and\n\u2022\ngeneral stock market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nSome provisions of our charter documents, Delaware law, and our Convertible Senior Notes may make takeover attempts difficult, which could depress the price of our stock and inhibit one\u2019s ability to receive a premium price for their shares.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our business, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares without stockholder approval. Any such issuance could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our business and may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Our amended and restated bylaws include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that require stockholders to give written notice of any proposal or director nomination to us within a specified period of time prior to any stockholder meeting and do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders, unless such stockholders hold not less than 50% of our stock entitled to vote at the meeting.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. Together these provisions may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us, adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the terms of our Convertible Senior Notes require us to offer to purchase the notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change. A non-stock takeover of our company may trigger the requirement that we purchase the Convertible Senior Notes. This feature may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.", "PERMNO": 76591, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "QDEL"}
