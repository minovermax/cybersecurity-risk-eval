Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\nWe may not be able to grow unless we increase market acceptance of our products, compete effectively and develop new products and applications.\nOur primary competition consists of wood products, which constitute a substantial majority of decking, railing, porches, fencing, trim and deck framing sales. Since wood-alternative products were introduced to the market in the early 1990\u2019s, their market acceptance has increased, but during the past few years, the rate of conversion from purchasing wood products to purchasing wood-alternative products slowed. Our ability to grow will depend, in part, on our success in continuing to convert demand for wood products into a demand for wood-alternative Trex products. To increase our market share, we must overcome:\n\u2022\nthe consumer lack of awareness of the enhanced value of wood-alternative decking, railing, porches, fencing, trim and deck framing products in general and Trex brand products in particular;\n\u2022\nthe resistance of many consumers and contractors to change from well-established wood products;\n\u2022\nthe consumer lack of awareness that the greater initial expense of Trex products compared to wood is a one-time cost that is reduced over time as Trex products have a longer life span than wood;\n\u2022\nthe established relationships existing between suppliers of wood products and contractors and homebuilders;\n\u2022\nactual and perceived quality issues with first generation wood-alternative products; and\n\u2022\nthe competition from other wood-alternative manufacturers.\nWe must also compete with a number of companies in the wood-alternative segment of the decking, railing, fencing and trim markets and with wood producers that currently have more production capacity than is required to meet the demand for such products. Our failure to compete successfully in such markets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to replace wood or increase the market share of wood-alternatives compared to wood. Many of the conventional lumber suppliers with which we compete have established ties to the building and construction industry and have well-accepted products. Our ability to compete depends, in part, upon a number of factors outside our control, including the ability of competitors to develop new non-wood alternatives that are more competitive with Trex products.\nIn addition to the above, substantially all of our revenues are derived from sales of our proprietary wood/plastic composite material. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, new products made from other materials, if we should experience significant problems, real or perceived, with product quality or acceptance of the Trex wood/polyethylene composite material, our lack of product diversification could have a significant adverse impact on our net sales levels.\nOur prospects for sales growth and profitability may be adversely affected if we fail to maintain product quality and product performance at an acceptable cost.\nWe will be able to expand our net sales and to sustain and enhance profitable operations only if we succeed in maintaining the quality and performance of our products. If we should not be able to produce high-quality products at standard manufacturing rates and yields, unit costs may be higher. A lack of product performance would negatively affect our profitability by impeding acceptance of our products in the marketplace and by leading to higher product replacement and consumer relations expenses. In recent periods, we have experienced significant warranty expenses related to material produced at our Nevada facility prior to 2007 that exhibits surface flaking. We have limited our financial exposure by agreeing to settle a nationwide class action lawsuit which fixes our obligation in each claim to provide replacement product and provide a partial labor reimbursement. However, because the establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of the number of future claims and the average cost of claims, our ultimate losses may differ from our warranty reserve. Increases we have made to the warranty reserve and payments for related claims in recent years have had a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows. Future increases to the warranty reserve could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows should we make such increases and pay such claims.\nIn addition, our products are used outdoors and are sometimes subject to heavy use and harsh exposure to the environment. Although our Limited Warranty excludes any conditions attributable to \u201cany act of God (such as flooding, hurricane, earthquake, lightning, etc., ), environmental condition (such as air pollution, mold, mildew, etc.), staining from foreign substances (such as dirt, grease, oil, etc.), or normal weathering (defined as exposure to sunlight, weather and atmosphere which may cause any colored surface to gradually fade, chalk, or accumulate dirt or stains\u201d), to the extent that our products are affected in any way, this may lead to an increased risk of product liability claims or litigation.\nA number of class action lawsuits based upon mold growth, color fading and color variation on our products have been brought against us, all of which have been settled. (See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for a\ndiscussion of these lawsuits.) In the event future lawsuits are brought against us relating to alleged product quality issues, such lawsuits are a potential financial exposure to us and could cause adverse publicity, which in turn could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products and also reduce our sales. Product quality claims could increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and, consequently, reduce our net sales, net income and liquidity.\nOur business is subject to risks in obtaining the raw materials we use at acceptable prices.\nThe production of our product requires substantial amounts of wood fiber and polyethylene. Our business strategy is to create a substantial cost advantage over our competitors by using waste wood fibers and scrap polyethylene. Our business could suffer from the termination of significant sources of raw materials, the payment of higher prices for raw materials or from the failure to obtain sufficient additional raw materials to meet planned increases in production. Our ability to obtain adequate supplies of scrap polyethylene depends on our success in developing new sources that meet our quality requirements, maintaining favorable relationships with suppliers and managing the collection of supplies from geographically dispersed locations.\nWe sell to certain customers that account for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our business.\nA limited number of customers account for a significant percentage of our sales. Specifically, sales through our 15 largest customers each year accounted for approximately 86% of gross sales during fiscal year 2014, 89% during fiscal year 2013 and 90% during fiscal year 2012.\nWe expect that a significant portion of our sales will continue to be sold through a small number of customers, and certain customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales. The loss of a significant customer could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited ability to control or project inventory build-ups in our distribution channel that can negatively affect our sales in subsequent periods.\nThe dynamic nature of our industry can result in substantial fluctuations in inventory levels of Trex products carried in our two-step distribution channel. We have limited ability to control or precisely project inventory build-ups, which can adversely affect our net sales levels in subsequent periods. We make the substantial majority of our sales to wholesale distributors, who, in turn, sell our products to local lumber yards. Because of the seasonal nature of the demand for decking, railing, deck framing, fencing and trim, our distribution channel partners must forecast demand for our products, place orders for the products, and maintain Trex product inventories in advance of the prime deck-building season, which generally occurs in our late first through third fiscal quarters. Accordingly, our results for the second and third fiscal quarters are difficult to predict and past performance will not necessarily indicate future performance. Inventory levels respond to a number of changing conditions in our industry, including product price increases resulting from escalating raw materials costs, increases in the number of competitive producers and in the production capacity of those competitors, the rapid pace of product introduction and innovation, changes in the levels of home-building and remodeling expenditures, and the cost and availability of credit.\nThe demand for our products is affected by adverse weather conditions.\nOur products are generally purchased shortly before installation and used in outdoor environments. As a result, there is a correlation between the amount of product we sell and the weather conditions around the time they are to be installed. Weather conditions, such as very high or low temperatures, intense and prolonged precipitation, hurricanes, floods, and regional fires in the regions we sell our products interfere with ordinary construction, delay projects and can even lead to cessation of certain construction involving our products.\nSince weather conditions and seasonal cycles cannot be accurately predicted, adverse weather conditions may shift our sales to subsequent reporting periods, or may also reduce overall sales given the limited decking season in many locations. Prolonged adverse weather conditions could have a negative impact on our financial statements.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services and the lack of availability of transportation and/or increases in cost could materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur business depends on the transportation of both finished goods to our distributors and the transportation of raw materials to us. We rely on third parties for transportation of these items. In particular, a significant portion of our finished goods are transported by flatbed trucks, which are occasionally in high demand (especially at the end of calendar quarters) and/or subject to price fluctuations based on market conditions and the price of fuel.\nIf the required supply of transportation services is unavailable when needed, we may be unable to sell our products at full value, or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were unavailable to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand. This could harm our reputation, negatively impact our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. In addition, a material increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nThe demand for our products is influenced by general economic conditions and could be adversely affected by economic downturns.\nThe demand for our products is correlated to changes in the health of the economy in general, and the level of activity in home improvements and, to a much lesser extent, new home construction. These levels of activity, in turn, are affected by such factors as home equity values, credit availability, consumer confidence and spending habits, employment, interest rates, inflation and general economic conditions. Market conditions in the housing industry slowed significantly in recent years, particularly in new home construction. Home equity values in many markets that decreased significantly during those time periods have only begun to recover. This devaluation in home equity values has adversely affected the availability of home equity withdrawals, which have resulted in decreased home improvement spending. We cannot predict when the economy, the home remodeling and new home construction environments will fully recover or if the current recovery will continue. Any continued economic downturn could reduce consumer income or equity capital available for spending on discretionary items such as decking, railing, porches, fencing and trim, which could adversely affect the demand for our products.\nWe have significant capital invested in property, plant and equipment that may become obsolete or impaired and result in a charge to our earnings.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had $98.7 million of net property, plant and equipment, $6.8 million of which relates to assets located at our Olive Branch, Mississippi manufacturing facility that was shut down in September 2007. In addition, each year we make significant capital investments to improve or expand our manufacturing capabilities. These improvements sometimes involve the implementation of new technology and replacement of existing equipment at our manufacturing facilities, which may result in charges to our earnings if the existing equipment is not fully depreciated. Significant replacement of equipment or changes in the expected cash flows related to our assets could result in reduced earnings in future periods.\nOur level of indebtedness, and ability to continue to obtain financing on favorable terms, could adversely affect our financial health and ability to compete.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had no outstanding indebtedness. At certain periods during the year, we borrowed significant amounts on our senior secured credit facility for working capital purposes, and it is\nforeseeable that we will need to borrow on the facility in 2015 for similar purposes. In addition, we may borrow money in the event we elect to pursue an acquisition or other transactions. Accordingly, our future level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it may:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds to alleviate liquidity constraints, as a result of financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance our principal secured indebtedness.\nIn addition, our senior secured credit facility imposes operating and financial restrictions that may limit our discretion on some business matters, which could make it more difficult for us to expand, finance our operations and engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. These restrictions may limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and additional liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nvoluntarily prepay other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliated persons;\n\u2022\nmake investments; and\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business.\nWe may incur indebtedness in addition to our current indebtedness. Any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future could subject us to similar or even more restrictive conditions.\nOur ability to make future principal and interest payments, borrow and repay amounts under our revolving credit facility and continue to comply with our loan covenants will depend primarily on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations. Our failure to comply with our loan covenants might cause our lenders to accelerate our repayment obligations under our credit facility, which may be declared payable immediately based on a default. To remain in compliance with our credit facility, we must maintain specified financial ratios based on our levels of debt, fixed charges, and earnings (excluding extraordinary gains and extraordinary non-cash losses) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, all of which are subject to the risks of our business.", "PERMNO": 86810, "SIC": 2400, "TIC": "TREX"}
