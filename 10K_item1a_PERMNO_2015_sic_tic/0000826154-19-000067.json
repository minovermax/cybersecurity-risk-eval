{"cik": "826154", "company": "ORRSTOWN FINANCIAL SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Credit\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual losses, our earnings would decrease.\nThere is no precise method of predicting loan losses. The required level of reserves, and the related provision for loan losses, can fluctuate from year to year, based on charge-offs and/or recoveries, loan volume, credit administration practices, and local and national economic conditions, among other factors. The ALL, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s evaluation of, among other factors, the status of specific impaired loans, trends in historical loss experience, delinquency, credit concentrations and economic conditions within our market area. The determination of the appropriate level of the ALL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our ALL.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our ALL and may require us to increase the provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of management. If loan charge-offs in future periods exceed the ALL, there would be a need to record additional provisions to increase our ALL. Furthermore, growth in the loan portfolio would generally lead to an increase in the provision for loan losses. Generally, increases in our ALL will result in a decrease in net income and stockholders\u2019 equity, and may have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe deterioration of one or more of our significant lending relationships could result in a significant increase in the nonperforming loans and the provisions for loan losses, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nCommercial real estate lending may expose us to a greater risk of loss and impact our earnings and profitability.\nOur business strategy includes making loans secured by commercial real estate. These types of loans generally have higher risk-adjusted returns and shorter maturities than other loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate properties are generally for larger amounts and may involve a greater degree of risk than other loans. Payments on loans secured by these properties are often dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans is subject to conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. In challenging economic conditions, these loans represent higher risk and could result in an increase in our total net charge-offs, requiring us to increase our ALL, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. While we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.\nThe credit risk related to commercial and industrial loans is greater than the risk related to residential loans.\nCommercial and industrial loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a greater degree of risk of nonpayment or late payment than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans.\nCommercial and industrial loans include advances to local and regional businesses for general commercial purposes and include permanent and short-term working capital, machinery and equipment financing, and may be either in the form of lines of credit or term loans. Although commercial and industrial loans may be unsecured to our highest rated borrowers, the majority of these loans are secured by the borrower\u2019s accounts receivable, inventory and machinery and equipment. In a significant number of these loans, the collateral also includes the business real estate or the business owner\u2019s personal real estate or assets. Commercial and industrial loans are more susceptible to risk of loss during a downturn in the economy, as borrowers may have greater difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and the value of the collateral may decline. We attempt to mitigate this risk through our underwriting standards, including evaluating the creditworthiness of the borrower and, to the extent available, credit ratings on the business. Additionally, monitoring of the loans through annual renewals and meetings with the borrowers are typical. However, these procedures cannot eliminate the risk of loss associated with commercial and industrial lending.\nOur commercial and industrial lending operations are located primarily in south central Pennsylvania and in Washington County, Maryland. Our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay these loans depends largely on economic conditions in these and surrounding areas. A deterioration in the economic conditions in these market areas could materially adversely affect our operations and increase loan delinquencies, increase problem assets and foreclosures, increase claims and lawsuits, decrease the demand for our products and services and decrease the value of collateral securing loans.\nRisks Related to Interest Rates and Investments\nChanges in interest rates could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding our exposure to changes in the interest rate environment. Operating income, net income and liquidity depend to a great extent on our net interest margin, i.e., the difference between the interest yields we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest rates we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition; general economic conditions; and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the FRB. If the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings, and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Our earnings and liquidity could also be materially adversely affected if the rates on interest-earning assets fall more quickly than those on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect our ability to originate loans; the ability of borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans; our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and the value of interest-earning assets, which would negatively impact stockholders\u2019 equity, and the ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets. Based on our interest rate sensitivity analyses, an increase in the general level of interest rates will negatively affect the market value of the investment portfolio because of the relatively higher duration of certain securities included in the investment portfolio.\nOur subordinated notes, issued in December 2018, have a 6.0% fixed interest rate through December 2023, after which the interest rate will convert to a variable rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for the applicable interest period plus 3.16% through maturity in December 2028. Depending on our financial condition at the time of the rate changing from fixed to variable, an increase in the interest rate on our subordinated debt could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nThe expected discontinuance of LIBOR presents risks to the financial instruments originated, issued or held by us that use LIBOR as a reference rate.\nLIBOR is used as a reference rate for many of our transactions, which means it is the base on which relevant interest rates are determined. Transactions include those in which we lend and borrow money and issue, purchase and sell securities. LIBOR is the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the process for setting LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021.\nWhile there are ongoing efforts to establish an alternative reference rate to LIBOR, as of the date of this report, no such rate has been accepted or is considered ready to be implemented.\nIf another rate does not achieve wide acceptance as the alternative to LIBOR, there likely will be disruption to all of the markets relying on the availability of a broadly accepted reference rate. Even if another reference rate ultimately replaces LIBOR, risks will remain for us with respect to outstanding loans, or other instruments using LIBOR. Those risks arise in connection with transitioning those instruments to a new reference rate and the corresponding value transfer that may occur in connection with that transition. Risks related to transitioning instruments to a new reference rate or to how LIBOR is calculated and its availability include impacts on the yield on loans or securities held by us and amounts paid on securities we have issued. The value of loans, securities, or borrowings tied to LIBOR and the trading market for LIBOR-based securities could also be impacted upon its discontinuance or if it is limited.\nFurther, it is possible that LIBOR quotes will become unavailable prior to 2021 if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. These risks may also be increased due to the shorter time frame for preparing for the transition.\nRisks Related to Competition and to Our Business Strategy\nDifficult economic and market conditions can adversely affect the financial services industry and may materially and adversely affect the Company.\nOur operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. If the growth of the U.S. economy slows, or if the economy worsens or enters into a recession, our growth and profitability could be constrained. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries can affect the stability of global financial markets, which could impact the U.S. economy and financial markets. Weak economic conditions are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, including a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. All of these factors are detrimental to our business. Our business is significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Changes in any of these policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn particular, we may face the following risks in connection with volatility in the economic environment:\n\u2022Loan delinquencies could increase;\n\u2022Problem assets and foreclosures could increase;\n\u2022Demand for our products and services could decline; and\n\u2022Collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, could decline in value, reducing customers' borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans.\nBecause our business is concentrated in south central Pennsylvania and Washington County, Maryland, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected by economic conditions and real estate values in these market areas.\nOur operations and the properties securing our loans are primarily located in south central Pennsylvania and in Washington County, Maryland. Our operating results depend largely on economic conditions and real estate valuations in these and surrounding areas. A deterioration in the economic conditions in these market areas could materially adversely affect our operations and increase loan delinquencies, increase problem assets and foreclosures, increase claims and lawsuits, decrease the demand for our products and services and decrease the value of collateral securing loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with nonperforming loans and collateral coverage.\nCompetition from other banks and financial institutions in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing other financial services may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.\nWe experience substantial competition in originating loans, both commercial and consumer loans, in our market area. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Some of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources, and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce our net income and liquidity by decreasing the number and size of loans that we originate and the interest rates we are able to charge on these loans.\nAs we expand our on-line lending capabilities, we will face competition, particularly in residential mortgage lending, from non-bank lenders (financial institutions that only make loans and do not offer deposit accounts such as a savings account or checking account) and financial technology companies (that use new technology and innovation with available resources in order to compete in the marketplace of traditional financial institutions and intermediaries in the delivery of financial services). This competition could similarly reduce our net income and liquidity.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Some of our competitors enjoy advantages, including more expansive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could materially adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, we may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase our cost of funds.\nThe Company\u2019s business strategy includes the continuation of moderate growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nOver the long term, we expect to continue to experience organic growth in loans and total assets, the level of our deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets requires us to successfully execute our business strategies, which includes continuing to grow our loan portfolio. Our ability to successfully grow will also depend on the continued availability of loan opportunities that meet underwriting standards. In addition, we may consider the acquisition of other financial institutions and branches within or outside of our market area to the extent permitted by our regulators. The success of any such acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to integrate the acquired institutions or branches into the current operations of the Company; our ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by customers of the acquired institution or branch locations; our ability to control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from any acquisition; and our ability to retain and integrate the appropriate personnel of the acquired institution or branches. We believe we have the resources and internal systems in place to successfully achieve and manage our future growth. If we do not manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to achieve our business plan goals and our business and prospects could be harmed.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by technological advances.\nTechnological advances impact our business. The banking industry undergoes technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving customer services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our current and prospective customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations.\nThe Company may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled people. We have, at times, experienced turnover among our senior officers. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and hire sufficiently skilled people to fill open and newly created positions or to retain current or future employees. An inability to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills to fill open positions, or the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel, could have a material adverse impact on our business due to the loss of their skills, knowledge of our markets, years of industry experience or the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nAn interruption or breach in security with respect to our information systems, or our outsourced service providers, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation and have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nInformation systems are critical to our business as our business operations and interaction with customers are increasingly supported by electronic means. We use various technological systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits and loans. We rely on software, communication, and information exchange on a variety of\ncomputing platforms and networks and over the internet, and we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other third-party vendors and their personnel.\nSecurity breaches of our systems or the systems of third-parties on which we rely could expose us to litigation, remediation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation and potential liability. Our corporate systems, third-party systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our information, our employees\u2019 information or our customers\u2019 information. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees to disclose information in order to gain access to such confidential information. In July 2018, we fell victim to a phishing attack, which led to an unauthorized third-party gaining access to two employee email accounts. Although this incident did not result in a material loss of revenue, any future incidents, particularly of larger scope or longer duration, could damage our brand and reputation and result in a material loss of revenue. If an actual or perceived security breach occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose customers, and we could suffer significant legal and financial harm due to such events or in connection with remediation efforts and costs, investigation costs or penalties, litigation, regulatory and enforcement actions, changed security and system protection measures. Any of these actions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional information technology tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches, as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from such a breach, could have a significant impact on our financial and operating results.\nWe could be adversely affected by a failure in our internal controls.\nA failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of us. We continue to devote a significant amount of effort and resources to constantly strengthening our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations. However, these efforts may not be effective in preventing a breach in or failure of our controls.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings.\nReputational risk, or the risk to the Company's earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from the actual or perceived manner in which we conduct our business activities, including banking operations and trust and investment operations, our management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues, and our protection of confidential client information. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company's ability to keep and attract customers and can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in the way we conduct our business activities and deal with our customers, communities and vendors, these steps may not be effective.\nWe may become subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nWe provide fiduciary services through OFA and Wheatland. From time to time, customers may make claims and take legal action with regard to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. Whether such claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such claims or legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, the claims or related actions may result in significant financial expense and liability to us and/or adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace, as well as adversely impact customer demand for our products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Mergers and Acquisitions\nOn October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Mercersburg. On October 23, 2018, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Hamilton Bancorp, Inc.\nGrowing by acquisition involves risks.\nWe intend to pursue a growth plan consistent with our business strategy, including growth by acquisition, as well as leveraging our existing branch network and adding new branch locations in current and future markets we choose to serve.\nOur ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to attract qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms, as well as on factors beyond our\ncontrol, such as economic conditions and competition. If we grow too quickly and are not able to attract qualified personnel, control costs and maintain asset quality, this continued rapid growth could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThere is no assurance when, or even if, our acquisition of Hamilton will be completed.\nThe merger agreement between the Company and Hamilton is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions include:\n\u2022approval of the merger agreement and the merger by Hamilton shareholders;\n\u2022the receipt of required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022absence of orders prohibiting the completion of the merger;\n\u2022effectiveness of the registration statement filed by the Company to register the shares of our common stock to be issued to Hamilton shareholders in the merger;\n\u2022the continued accuracy of the representations and warranties by both parties and the performance by both parties of their covenants and agreements; and\n\u2022the receipt by both parties of legal opinions from their respective tax counsels.\nThere can be no assurance that the parties will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond their control will be satisfied or waived.\nThe Hamilton merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed.\nThe parties can agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement under specified circumstances. In addition, Hamilton may choose to terminate the merger agreement if the volume weighted average stock price of our common stock as reported on NASDAQ during the 15 trading day period immediately preceding the determination date (as defined in the merger agreement) is less than $20.1535 per share and our common stock underperforms the NASDAQ Bank Index by more than 15% between October 23, 2018 and the determination date. Any such termination would be subject to the right of the Company to increase the amount of our common stock or cash consideration to be provided to Hamilton shareholders pursuant to the formulas prescribed in the merger agreement.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received or may take longer than expected in order to be obtained for the Hamilton merger.\nWe are required to obtain the approvals of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, and the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation prior to completing the merger. Obtaining the approval of these regulatory agencies may delay the date of completion of the merger. In addition, you should be aware that, as in any transaction, it is possible that, among other things, restrictions on the combined operations of the two companies may be sought by governmental agencies as a condition to obtaining the required regulatory approvals. This may diminish the benefits of the merger to us or have an adverse effect on us following the merger and prevent us from achieving the expected benefits of the merger. We have the right to terminate the merger agreement if the approval of any governmental authority required for consummation of the merger and the other transactions provided for in the merger agreement, imposes any term, condition or restriction upon us or any of our subsidiaries that we reasonably determine would (a) prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by us of any material portion of Hamilton's business or assets, (b) compel us to dispose or hold separate any material portion of Hamilton's assets or (c) compel us to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or request, if the prohibition, limitation, condition or other requirement described in clauses (a)-(c) of this sentence would have a material adverse effect on the future operation by us of our business, taken as a whole.\nIf the Hamilton merger is not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits.\nWe will incur substantial expenses in connection with the pending acquisition of Hamilton. If the merger is not completed, these expenses may have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nGoodwill incurred in the Mercersburg and Hamilton mergers may negatively affect our financial condition.\nTo the extent that the merger consideration, consisting of the cash and the number of shares of our common stock issued in the Mercersburg merger or to be issued in the Hamilton merger, exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, that amount will be reported as goodwill by us. In accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill will not be amortized but will be evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant. A failure to realize expected benefits of the merger could adversely impact the carrying value of the goodwill recognized in the merger and, in turn, negatively affect our financial results.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate Mercersburg\u2019s and Hamilton's operations.\nThe mergers involve the integration of companies that previously operated independently with Orrstown. The difficulties of combining the companies\u2019 operations include:\n\u2022integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds;\n\u2022integrating departments, systems, operating procedures and information technologies;\n\u2022combining different corporate cultures;\n\u2022retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; and\n\u2022retaining key employees.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the combined company\u2019s businesses and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 operations could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company.\nThe success of the mergers will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the business of the Company with Mercersburg and Hamilton. If we are unable to successfully integrate Mercersburg or Hamilton, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the mergers may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. For example, we may fail to realize the anticipated increase in earnings and cost savings anticipated to be derived from the acquisitions. In addition, as with regard to any merger, a significant change in interest rates or economic conditions or decline in asset valuations may also cause us not to realize expected benefits and result in the mergers not being as accretive as expected.\nUnanticipated costs relating to the mergers could reduce our future earnings per share.\nWe believe that we have reasonably estimated the likely costs of integrating the operations of the Company and Mercersburg and Hamilton, and the incremental costs of operating as a combined company. However, it is possible that we could incur unexpected transaction costs such as taxes, fees or professional expenses or unexpected future operating expenses such as increased personnel costs or increased taxes, which could result in the mergers not being as accretive as expected or having a dilutive effect on the combined company\u2019s earnings per share.\nThe market price of our common stock after the mergers may be affected by factors different from those affecting our shares currently.\nThe businesses of the Company and Mercersburg and Hamilton differ and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the combined company\u2019s shares of common stock may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations and market prices of common stock of each of us, Mercersburg and Hamilton. The market value of our common stock fluctuates based upon various factors, including changes in our business, operations or prospects, market assessments of the merger, regulatory considerations, market and economic considerations, and other factors. Further, the market price of our common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our common stock.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Legal Matters\nGovernmental regulation and regulatory actions against us may impair our operations or restrict our growth.\nThe Company is subject to regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The requirements and limitations imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit our shareholders. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is within our control. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied or enforced. The Company cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation, regulation or the application thereof. Compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. Bank regulations can hinder our ability to compete with financial services companies that are not regulated in the same manner or are subject to less regulation.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act may affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and stock price.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions, including several provisions that affect how community banks and bank holding companies will be regulated in the future. Among other things, these provisions relax rules regarding interstate branching; allow financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts; change the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage; and impose new capital requirements on bank holding companies. Many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented over time and will be subject to implementation regulations developed over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is not certain.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB which has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets are examined by their applicable bank regulators.\nThe Company may be required to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. Failure to comply with requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While the Company cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that are required to be paid for FDIC insurance. If there are bank or financial institution failures, the Company may be required to pay significantly higher premiums than the levels currently imposed or additional special assessments or taxes that could adversely affect earnings. Any future increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect the results of operations.\nLegislative, regulatory and legal developments involving income and other taxes could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal and U.S. state income, payroll, property, sales and use, and other types of taxes including the Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's provisions for income taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactments of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes, and therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Increases in the assessment rate for the Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax, which is calculated on the outstanding equity of the Bank, may also materially adversely affect results of operations.\nThe Company is required to use judgment in applying accounting policies and different estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies could result in a decrease in capital and/or other material changes to the reports of financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the ALL, the fair value of certain financial instruments, particularly securities, and goodwill and purchase accounting associated with acquisitions. While we have identified those accounting policies that we consider critical and have procedures in place to facilitate the associated judgments, different assumptions in the application of these policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and SEC and other regulatory bodies change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can be operationally complex to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, that will, effective on January 1, 2020, substantially change the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. The update replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, companies must recognize credit losses on these assets equal to management\u2019s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life. Companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including details about\npast events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In December 2018, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC released a final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to address this upcoming change to the treatment of credit expense and allowances. The final rule provides an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects upon adopting the standard. The impact of this final rule on the Company will depend on whether we elect to phase in the impact of the standard over a three-year period. The standard is likely to have a negative impact, potentially materially, to the allowance and capital at adoption in 2020; however, we are still evaluating the impact. It is also possible that our ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be negatively impacted in periods following adoption.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules is uncertain.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules have targeted higher levels of base capital, certain capital buffers, and a migration toward common equity as the key source of regulatory capital, as domestic and international bank regulatory agencies have sought to require financial institutions, including depository institutions, to maintain generally higher levels of capital. The application of more stringent capital requirements to the Company and the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, result in the need for additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements, including limitations on our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nPending litigation and legal proceedings and the impact of any finding of liability or damages could adversely impact the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.\nAs more fully described in Note 21, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statement and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the allegations of Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's (\"SEPTA\") second amended complaint disclosed the existence of a confidential, non-public, fact-finding inquiry regarding the Company being conducted by the SEC. On September 27, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC resolving the investigation of accounting and related matters at the Company for the periods ended June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2011. As part of the settlement agreement, the Company agreed to pay a civil money penalty of $1 million. In February 2018, the Court issued an order continuing all case management deadlines for the completion of discovery, the filing of motions and various pre-trial conferences, until further order of the Court. Discovery in the case is ongoing.\nThe Company believes that the allegations of SEPTA's second amended complaint are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against those claims. It is not possible at this time to estimate reasonably possible losses, or even a range of reasonably possible losses, in connection with the litigation. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not incur any losses associated with this litigation or that any losses that are incurred will not be material.\nIndemnification costs associated with litigation and legal proceedings could adversely impact the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are generally required, to the extent permitted by Pennsylvania law, to indemnify our current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in lawsuits. We also have certain contractual indemnification obligations to third parties regarding litigation. Generally, insurance coverage is not available for such indemnification costs we could incur to third parties. Current or future litigation could result in indemnification expenses that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nThe Parent Company is a holding company dependent for liquidity on payments from its bank subsidiary, which is subject to restrictions.\nThe Parent Company is a holding company and depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from the Bank to fund dividend payments and stock repurchases, if permitted, and to fund all payments on obligations. The Bank is subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prohibit or reduce the flow of funds from it to us. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the Bank\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors, including its depositors.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems, losses of\ndepositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of other banks\u2019 difficulties or failure, which would increase the capital we are required to maintain to support such growth.\nRisks Related to Owning our Stock\nIf the Company wants, or is compelled, to raise additional capital in the future, that capital may not be available when it is needed or on terms favorable to current shareholders.\nFederal banking regulators require us and our banking subsidiary to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. These capital levels are determined and dictated by law, regulation and banking regulatory agencies. In addition, capital levels are also determined by our management and board of directors based on capital levels that, they believe, are necessary to support our business operations. At December 31, 2018, all four capital ratios for us and our banking subsidiary were above regulatory minimum levels to be deemed \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under current bank regulatory guidelines. To be \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d banks generally must maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%. The phase-in implementation of the capital conservation buffer was completed on January 1, 2019, which essentially increased the aforementioned capital ratios by 2.5% .\nThe Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance of our ability to raise additional capital on terms and time frames acceptable to us or to raise additional capital at all. Additionally, the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities, we would likely dilute the ownership interests of current investors and the price at which we issue additional shares of stock could be less than the current market price of our common stock and, thus, could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of our common stock. Furthermore, a capital raise through the issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to volatility.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been subject to fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated variations in our operational results and cash flows, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, trading volume, large purchases or sales of our common stock, market conditions within the banking industry, the general state of the securities markets and the market for stocks of financial institutions, as well as general economic conditions.\nThe Parent Company's primary source of income is dividends received from its bank subsidiary.\nThe Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders. The Company also has repurchased shares of its common stock. The Company\u2019s primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from the Bank to the Company without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Restrictions on the Bank\u2019s ability to dividend funds to the Company are included in Note 14, Restrictions on Dividends, Loans and Advances, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"", "PERMNO": 92919, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ORRF"}
