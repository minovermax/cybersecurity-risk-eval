Risk Factors.\nThe following is a description of what we consider the key challenges and risks relating to our business and investing in our common stock. This discussion should be considered in conjunction with the discussion under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Information\u201d preceding Part I, the information set forth under Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d and with the discussion of the business included in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d These risks comprise the material risks of which we are aware. If any of the events or developments described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in any documents that we subsequently file publicly were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nBanyan is a shell company without significant assets or operations.\nBanyan is a shell company without significant operations. Without revenue we are currently dependent upon loans and equity infusions from affiliates to meet our cash needs. Although we have entered into an agreement to purchase the business of International Thermocast Corporation, we cannot guaranty the acquisition will be completed successfully. Our ability to continue on an on-going basis is dependent upon, among other things, raising capital and identifying an operating business to acquire, among other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe will need to raise additional capital, which may not be available to us and may limit our operations or growth.\nWe will need additional capital to fund the implementation of our business plan. We cannot assure you that any necessary subsequent financing will be successful. Our future liquidity and capital requirements are difficult to predict as they depend upon many factors, including our ability to identify and complete acquisitions and the success of any business we do acquire. We will need to raise additional funds in order to meet working capital requirements or additional capital expenditures or to take advantage of other opportunities. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise needed capital, our growth and operations may be impeded. In addition, if we raise capital by selling additional shares of stock, your percentage ownership in Banyan will be diluted.\nWe may not be able to successfully acquire or integrate a new business.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with acquiring and integrating new business operations. The growth and success of our business will depend on our ability to identify, acquire and operate new assets or businesses. We may compete with companies that have significantly greater resources than we do for potential acquisition candidates. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to:\n\u00b7 identify suitable acquisition candidates or opportunities,\n\u00b7 acquire assets or business operations on commercially acceptable terms,\n\u00b7 obtain financing necessary to complete an acquisition on reasonable terms or at all,\n\u00b7 satisfy the terms and conditions of any state or federal regulatory approvals required for acquisition,\n\u00b7 manage effectively the operations of acquired businesses, or\n\u00b7 achieve our operating and growth strategies with respect to the acquired assets or businesses.\nBusinesses that we acquire in the future could involve unforeseen difficulties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nCertain employees and directors own a significant interest in Banyan.\nCertain directors and officers control 66.6% of our outstanding common shares (66.0% if they exercised their options). Accordingly, they possess a significant vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders including the election of the members of our board. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of preventing or discouraging transactions involving an actual or a potential change of control of Banyan, regardless of whether a premium is offered over then-current market prices.\nThe current state of debt markets could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.\nThe cost of commercial debt may increase or may contract as a result of certain factors including the tightening of underwriting standards by lenders and credit rating agencies. Credit spreads for major sources of capital may grow significantly as investors may demand a higher risk premium. Should our borrowing cost increase, either by increases in the index rates or by increases in lender spreads, we will need to factor such increases into the economics of our business plan. This may result in our generating lower overall economic returns and potentially reducing cash flow available for business operations and business development.\nWe have issued preferred stock, which may decrease both our net income available to common shareholders and cash flow.\nWe have 10,375 shares of preferred stock outstanding in the amount of $1.04 million, which were used for working capital needs when issued. Although investments in leveraged companies offer the opportunity for capital appreciation, leveraged investments also involve a high degree of risk. The amount of our preferred stock outstanding could have important consequences for us and our investors. For example, it could:\n\u00b7 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow obtained from financing to payments on our mandatory preferred stock dividends, thereby reducing funds available for acquisitions, and other appropriate business development opportunities that may arise in the future, and\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in conducting our business plan of identifying and acquiring an operating company, which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less preferred stock.\nOur ability to make scheduled dividend payments on our preferred stock will depend primarily on our ability to successfully find an operating entity to acquire, as well as the future performance of that entity. All of which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We have been unable to make payments on our outstanding preferred stock and many of our preferred shareholders have agreed to accept common stock in lieu of cash dividends. There can be no assurance that our business plan will generate sufficient cash flow to pay mandatory preferred stock dividends or meet our other cash needs.\nRisks Relating to Our Shares\nDirectors\u2019 options and outstanding convertible preferred stock may depress the price of our common stock.\nAs a result of the private placements including issuances of preferred stock in 2012 and prior years, there are shares of outstanding preferred stock which can be converted into as many as 103,750 shares of our common stock for $12.50 per share. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we have issued options to purchase 5,000 shares to our directors as compensation for serving on the board at prices ranging from $10.30 a share. If the directors\u2019 options are exercised or the shares of preferred stock are converted, your ownership of the Company will be diluted. In addition, the issuance of a significant number of shares upon conversion of shares of preferred stock or the exercise of options could depress the price of our stock if there isn\u2019t enough demand for the shares in the market. Even if the shares of preferred stock are not converted, the large number of shares issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock could cause an overhang on the market.\nIf you invest in Banyan, you may experience substantial dilution and the market price of our shares may decrease.\nIn the event we identify and obtain an operating entity, there may be a dilutive effect on the holders of our securities. In addition, as part of our recruitment process and in connection with our efforts to attract and retain employees and directors, we may offer stock options, restricted stock shares or other types of equity-based incentives to its future employees and directors. The Company\u2019s issuance of equity-based incentives to new hires, senior management and directors, may cause you significant dilution as a result of such issuances. Although shares of common stock issued in conjunction with private placements and to be issued upon conversion of our preferred stock will be \u201crestricted\u201d securities under the Securities Act of 1933 prior to any registration statement being filed and being declared effective by the SEC, they may nonetheless be sold prior to that time in reliance on registration exemptions contained in Rule 144 of the Securities Act, subject to certain resale restrictions imposed by Rule 144. Such issuances and sales may also depress the market price of our shares.\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price for our common stock is below $5.00 per share, and our stock trades are considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d according to SEC rules. This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares.\nYou may not be able to sell your shares because there is a limited market for our stock.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the OTCQB, currently there is limited trading volume in our stock and there may be very limited demand for it as well. As a result, it may be difficult for you to sell our common stock despite the fact it is traded on the OTCQB.\nOur preferred stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have 10,375 shares of preferred stock outstanding of the 49,950 shares of stock that were previously issued. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued preferred stock and to issue those shares without any further action or vote by the common stockholders. The holders of the preferred stock are entitled to receive payment before any of the common stockholders upon liquidation of the Company and we cannot pay a dividend on our common stock unless we first pay dividends required by our preferred stock. In addition, the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. These adverse effects could include subordination to preferred shareholders in the payment of dividends and upon our liquidation and dissolution, and the use of preferred stock as an anti-takeover measure, which could impede a change in control that is otherwise in the interests of holders of our common stock. In December 2012, the Company extended an offer to preferred shareholders to receive payment of dividends in the form of common stock in lieu of cash. On September 30, 2014, we converted 39,575 shares of preferred stock as part of that offer. As of December 31, 2015, 56.3% or approximately $103,750 of the annual dividend due to preferred shareholders is paid in common stock; the balance will remain accrued until such time as the Company has sufficient cash from operations to issue cash payment. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As the Company issues payment of these dividends in common stock, your ownership percentage in Banyan is diluted.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of cash dividends depends on our future earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors that our board of directors may consider relevant. Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends, the only return on your investment may be limited to the market price of the shares.", "PERMNO": 69147, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "BRST"}
