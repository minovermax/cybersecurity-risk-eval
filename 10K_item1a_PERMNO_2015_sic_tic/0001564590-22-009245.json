The risks described below represent all of the material risks currently known to us; however, they are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks that are currently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Business and Operations\nA future substantial deterioration in economic conditions, especially in the United States and Europe, would adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions affect the Company\u2019s sales volumes, pricing levels and overall profitability. Demand for many of the Company\u2019s products depends on end-use markets. Challenging economic conditions may reduce demand for our products and may also impair the ability of customers to pay for products they have purchased. As a result, the Company\u2019s reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs for accounts receivable may increase. Significant deterioration in economic conditions, especially in the United States and Europe, has had and may again have negative effects on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant deterioration in economic conditions has caused and may again cause deterioration in the credit quality of our customers and the estimated residual value of our equipment. This could further negatively impact the ability of our customers to obtain the resources they need to make purchases of our equipment. Reduced credit availability will diminish our customers\u2019 ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, and meet ongoing working capital needs. If customers do not have sufficient access to credit, demand for the Company\u2019s products will likely decline. Reduced access to credit and the capital markets will also negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and supply chain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in national, state and local government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus, shelter-in-place restrictions, and limitations or shutdowns of business operations. These measures, some of which are continuing or being re-implemented in light of new variants of the virus, have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our dealers and suppliers. We have significant operations worldwide, including in the United States, Italy and Romania and each of these countries have been affected by the pandemic and have taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing facilities and support operations. There is still uncertainty regarding the full impact and duration of such measures and potential future measures, and restrictions on our access to our facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our customers, dealers and suppliers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our supply chain and resulted in higher material costs as well as delays in scheduled shipments of our products. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, although the full extent is still uncertain. As the pandemic continues to evolve and new variants continue to emerge, the extent of the impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the continued duration of the pandemic, government actions to contain the virus and/or treat its impact, restrictions on travel, the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer demand, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are still uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nOur revenues and profitability are impacted by government spending and fluctuations in the construction industry.\nMany of the Company\u2019s customers depend substantially on government spending, including highway construction and maintenance and other infrastructure projects by U.S. federal and state governments as well as foreign governments. Any decrease or delay in government funding of highway construction and maintenance and other infrastructure projects could cause the Company\u2019s revenues and profits to decrease.\nThe Company\u2019s level of indebtedness reduces our financial flexibility and meeting financial covenants required by our debt agreements could impede our ability to successfully operate.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s total debt was $45.4 million, which includes notes payable and finance lease obligations.\nOur level of debt affects our operations in several important ways, including the following:\n\u2022\na significant portion of our cash flow from operations is likely to be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\nour cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments; and\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain additional loans as a result of covenants and agreements with existing debt holders.\nThe Company\u2019s existing debt agreements contain a number of significant covenants which may limit our ability to, among other things, borrow additional money, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, dispose of assets and acquire new businesses. These covenants also require the Company to meet certain financial and non-financial tests. A default or other event of non-compliance, if not waived or otherwise permitted by the Company\u2019s lenders, could result in acceleration of the Company\u2019s debt and possibly bankruptcy.\nThe Company may be unable to negotiate extensions of our credit agreements and to obtain additional debt or equity financing when needed.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on the amount of cash generated or required by our current operations, as well as additional funds which may be needed to finance future acquisitions. Future cash needs are subject to substantial uncertainty.\nAdequate funds may not be available when needed, and if we do not receive sufficient capital, we may be required to alter or reduce the scope of our operations or to forego making future acquisitions. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results, which could negatively impact our business, investor confidence, and the price of our common stock.\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, we previously did not maintain an effective control environment over information technology and general controls, based on the criteria established in the COSO framework, to enable identification and mitigation of risks of material accounting errors. We completed remediation measures related to the material weaknesses and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. However, completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly or remain adequate. Accordingly, if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures in the future, our ability to record, process, and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation, investigations, or penalties; negatively affect our liquidity, our access to capital markets, our ability to maintain compliance with covenants, any of which may require substantial management resources or cause our stock price to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected by the cyclical nature of its markets.\nA substantial portion of our revenues are attributed to a limited number of customers which may decrease or cease purchasing any time, since the Company\u2019s products depend upon the general economic conditions of the markets in which the Company competes. The Company\u2019s sales depend in part upon its customers\u2019 replacement or repair cycles. Adverse economic conditions, including a decrease in commodity prices, may cause customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery. Downward economic cycles may result in reductions in sales of the Company\u2019s products, which may reduce the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company\u2019s business is sensitive to increases in interest rates.\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of variable rate debt. If interest rates rise, it becomes costlier for the Company\u2019s customers to borrow money to pay for the equipment they buy from the Company. Should the United States Federal Reserve Board decide to increase rates, as it has indicated it intends to do in March 2022, prospects for business investment and manufacturing could deteriorate sufficiently and impact sales opportunities.\nOur increasingly international operations expose us to additional risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.\nThe international expansion of our business may expose us to risks inherent in conducting foreign operations. These risks include:\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with managing geographically diverse operations, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;\n\u2022\nthe increased cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange and interest rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions, if we continue to do so in the future;\n\u2022\ncash requirements to finance business growth;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining protection and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ncompliance with additional regulations and government authorities in a highly regulated business;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions internationally; and\n\u2022\npublic health concerns, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, changes to the United States\u2019 participation in, withdrawal from, renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the non-renewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries, tariff quotas, and retaliatory tariffs, trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. Dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses, revenues and earnings are denominated in other countries\u2019 currencies, including the Euro, Chilean Peso, and Argentinean Peso. Those assets, liabilities, expenses, revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Such fluctuations in foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. Dollar caused a loss of approximately $0.5 million on our actual results.\nThe risks that the Company faces in its international operations may continue to intensify if the Company further develops and expands its international operations.\nThe Company may face limitations on its ability to integrate acquired businesses and manage anticipated growth and may be unable to effectively respond to technological change and implementing new systems.\nThe successful integration of new business depends on the Company\u2019s ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. The Company cannot ensure that these acquired companies will operate profitably or that the intended beneficial effect from these acquisitions will be realized.\nIf the Company fails to manage growth, the Company\u2019s financial results and business prospects may be harmed. To manage the Company\u2019s growth and to execute its business plan efficiently, the Company will need to institute, maintain and continue to improve operational, financial and management controls, as well as reporting systems and procedures. The Company also must effectively expand, train and manage its employee base. The Company may not be successful in any of these endeavors.\nThe markets served by the Company are not historically characterized by rapidly changing technology. Nevertheless, the Company\u2019s future success will depend in part upon the Company\u2019s ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products. If the Company fails to anticipate or respond adequately to competitors\u2019 product improvements and new production introductions, future results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.\nSome of our customers rely on financing with third parties to purchase our products.\nWe rely on sales of our products to generate cash from operations. Significant portions of our sales are financed by third-party finance companies on behalf of our customers. The availability and terms of financing by third parties are affected by general economic conditions, credit worthiness of our customers and estimated residual value of our equipment. Deterioration in credit quality of our customers or estimated residual value of our equipment, increases in interest rates or changes in the terms of third-party financing agreements could negatively impact the ability or willingness of our customers to obtain resources they need to purchase our equipment. There can be no assurance third-party finance companies will continue to extend credit to our customers.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry and the Company is particularly subject to the risks of such competition.\nThe Company competes in a highly competitive industry and the competition which the Company encounters has an effect on its product prices, market share, revenues and profitability. Because certain competitors have substantially greater financial, production, research and development resources and substantially greater name recognition than the Company, the Company is particularly subject to the risks inherent in competing with them and may be put at a competitive disadvantage. To compete successfully, the Company\u2019s products must excel in terms of quality, price, product line, ease of use, safety and comfort, and the Company must also provide excellent customer service. The greater financial resources of the Company\u2019s competitors may put it at a competitive disadvantage. If competition in the Company\u2019s industry intensifies or if the Company\u2019s current competitors enhance their products or lower their prices for competing products, the Company may lose sales or be required to lower its prices. This may reduce revenue from the Company\u2019s products and services, lower its gross margins or cause the Company to lose market share. The Company may not be able to differentiate its products from those of competitors, successfully develop or introduce less costly products, offer better performance than competitors or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by competitors.\nThe Company is dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages.\nThe Company obtains materials and manufactured components from third-party suppliers. Any delay in the ability of the Company\u2019s suppliers to provide the Company with necessary materials and components may affect the Company\u2019s capabilities at a number of its manufacturing locations, or may require the Company to seek alternative supply sources. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting the Company\u2019s suppliers including capacity constraints, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, difficulties in obtaining raw materials, shipping delays or disruptions, public health emergencies, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any delay in receiving supplies could impair the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products to its customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company purchases materials and services from suppliers on extended terms based on the Company\u2019s overall credit rating. Negative changes in the Company\u2019s credit rating may impact suppliers\u2019 willingness to extend terms and increase the cash requirements of the business.\nPrice increases in materials could reduce our profitability.\nWe use large amounts of steel and other items in the manufacture of our products. In the past, market prices of some of our key raw materials increased significantly. If we experience future significant increases in material costs, including steel, we may not be able to reduce product cost in other areas or pass raw material price increases on to our customers and our margins could be adversely affected.\nThe Company faces product liability claims and other liabilities due to the nature of its business.\nIn the Company\u2019s lines of business numerous suits have been filed alleging damages for accidents that have occurred during the use or operation of the Company\u2019s products. The Company is self-insured, up to certain limits, for these product liability exposures, as well as for certain exposures related to general, workers\u2019 compensation and automobile liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic losses as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Any material liabilities not covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon the continued protection of its trademarks and the Company may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain, defend, protect and enforce its intellectual property rights.\nThe Company\u2019s registered and common law trademarks, as well as certain of the Company\u2019s licensed trademarks, have significant value and are instrumental to the Company\u2019s ability to market its products. The Company\u2019s trademarks \u201cManitex\u201d, \u201cBadger\u201d, \u201cValla\u201d, \u201cPM\u201d and \u201cO&S\u201d are important to the Company\u2019s business as the majority of the Company\u2019s products are sold under those names. The Company has not registered all of its trademarks in the United States nor in the foreign countries where it does business. Third parties could assert claims against such intellectual property that the Company could be unable to successfully resolve. If the Company has to change the names of any of its products, it may experience a loss of goodwill associated with its brand names, customer confusion and a loss of sales.\nIn addition, international protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property may not be available in some foreign countries to the same extent permitted by the laws of the United States. The Company could also incur substantial costs to defend legal actions relating to use of its intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company may be unable to access the capital markets to raise funds and provide liquidity when needed.\nOur access to capital markets to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities is subject to various factors, including general economic and/or financial market conditions which are outside our control, as well as our historical and expected future financial performance and perceived credit worthiness. Significant changes in market liquidity conditions or our actual or perceived financial condition could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nCompliance with changing laws and regulations may increase our costs or reduce our business flexibility.\nOur operations are subject to a number of potential risks. Such risks principally include:\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest;\n\u2022\nglobal and regional economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical instability;\n\u2022\nterrorist activities and the U.S. and international response thereto;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country;\n\u2022\nexport duties and quotas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign customs and tariffs;\n\u2022\ncurrent and changing regulatory environments;\n\u2022\ndifficulties protecting our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining distribution support;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters; and\n\u2022\ncurrent and changing tax laws.\nThe Company must comply with all applicable laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit engaging in corruption for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These anti-corruption laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Our global activities and distribution model are subject to risk of corruption by our employees and in addition, our sales agents, distributors, dealers and other third parties that transact Manitex business particularly because these parties are generally not subject to our control.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are attributed to limited number of customers which may decrease or cease purchasing any time.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are attributed to a limited number of customers. We generally do not have long-term supply agreements with our customers. Even if a multi-year contract exists, the customer is not required to commit to minimum purchases and can cease\npurchasing at any time. If we were to lose either a significant customer or several smaller customers our operating results and cash flows would be adversely impacted.\nThe Company depends on its information technology systems. If its information technology systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner or if the security of them is breached, it could be disruptive and or adversely affect the operations and results of operations of the Company.\nThe Company depends on its information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. If our information technology systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner, it could be disruptive and or adversely affect the operations and results of operations of the Company, including the ability of the Company to report accurate and timely financial results.\nFurthermore, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. A failure of or breach in information technology security could expose us and our customers, distributors and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability, as well as the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe Company relies on key management.\nThe Company relies on the management and leadership skills of Steve Filipov, its Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Filipov entered into an employment agreement commencing on September 1, 2019. Under the employment agreement, Mr. Filipov\u2019s employment term automatically extends for successive periods of three years unless either the Company or Mr. Filipov gives written notice to the other party of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the end of the then current employment term. The loss of his services could have a significant and negative impact on the Company\u2019s business. In addition, the Company relies on the management and leadership skills of other senior executives. The Company could be harmed by the loss of key personnel in the future.\nThe Company may be required to record goodwill, other intangibles and fixed assets impairment charges on all or a significant amount of the goodwill, other intangibles and fixed assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company recognized approximately $2.1 million of impairment charges in goodwill, other intangibles and fixed assets. The Company tests goodwill and other intangibles for impairment at least annually. If the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill or intangibles, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess, as occurred in 2021. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill could materially negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s principal shareholders, executive officers and directors hold a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s common stock, and these shareholders may take actions that may be adverse to your interests.\nThe Company\u2019s principal shareholders, executive officers and directors beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 39% of the Company\u2019s common stock as of January 25, 2022. As a result, these shareholders, acting together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers, consolidations, sales and purchases of assets. They also could dictate the management of the Company\u2019s business and affairs. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination, even if smaller shareholders support such a transaction, which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent smaller shareholders from receiving a premium in such a transaction.\nProvisions of the Michigan Business Corporation Act and the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Rights Agreement may discourage or prevent a takeover of the Company.\nProvisions of the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, Michigan law, and the Rights Agreement, as amended, between the Company and Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solution, Inc., as rights agent, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to you. These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s shares. Because of these provisions, you might not be able to receive a premium on your investment. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, with approval by a majority of its independent directors but without requiring shareholder consent, to issue shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to significantly dilute the ownership percentage of existing shareholders and prevent a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nlimit our shareholders\u2019 ability to call a special meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s shareholders\u2019 ability to amend, alter or repeal the Company bylaws; and\n\u2022\nrestrict business combinations with certain shareholders.\nThe provisions described above could prevent, delay or defer a change in control of the Company or its management.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile.\nThe trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including:\n\u2022\nthe degree to which the Company successfully implements its business strategy;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of the Company\u2019s revenues or operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet expectations of industry analysts;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by the Company\u2019s competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in business conditions affecting the Company and its customers; and\n\u2022\npotential to be delisted.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been brought against companies. If a securities class action suit is filed against us, whether or not meritorious, we would incur substantial legal fees and our management\u2019s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation.\nThe cost of compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may negatively impact the Company\u2019s income.\nThe Company is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including those rules and regulations mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires all reporting companies to include in their annual report a statement of management\u2019s responsibilities for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of those internal controls. Section 404 further requires that the reporting company\u2019s independent auditors attest to, and report on, this management assessment. The Company expects its expenses related to its internal and external auditors to be significant.", "PERMNO": 90568, "SIC": 3537, "TIC": "MNTX"}
