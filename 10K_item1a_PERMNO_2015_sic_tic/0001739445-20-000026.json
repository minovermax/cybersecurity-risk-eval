{"cik": "1739445", "company": "Arcosa, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nArcosa's business, financial condition, and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business, financial condition, or results of operations, including causing its actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Arcosa or that it currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect it in future periods.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations.\nMany of the industries in which Arcosa operates are subject to global market volatility and economic cyclicality.\nInstability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that Arcosa\u2019s products serve, fluctuations in commodity prices, changes in legislative policy, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or adverse changes in the financial condition of Arcosa\u2019s customers could lead to a reduction in orders for Arcosa\u2019s products and customers\u2019 requests for deferred deliveries of Arcosa\u2019s backlog orders. Additionally, such events could result in Arcosa\u2019s customers\u2019 attempts to unilaterally cancel or terminate firm contracts or orders in whole or in part resulting in contract or purchase order breaches which could result in increased commercial litigation costs.\nIf volatile conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers\u2019 access to credit, product order volumes may decrease, or customers may default on payments owed to Arcosa. Likewise, if Arcosa\u2019s suppliers face challenges obtaining credit, selling their products to customers that require purchasing credit, or otherwise operating their businesses, the supply of materials Arcosa purchases from them to manufacture its products may be interrupted.\nPeriodic downturns in economic conditions usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical industries in which Arcosa participates due to decreased demand for new and replacement products. Decreased demand could result in lower sales volumes, lower prices, and/or a decline in or loss of profits. The barge and wind energy industries in particular have previously experienced sharp cyclical downturns and at such times operated with a minimal backlog. While the business cycles of Arcosa\u2019s different operations may not typically coincide, an economic downturn could affect disparate cycles contemporaneously.\nAny of the foregoing market or industry conditions or events could result in reductions in Arcosa\u2019s revenues, increased price competition, or increased operating costs, which could adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition.\nArcosa operates in highly competitive industries. Arcosa may not be able to sustain its market positions, which may impact its financial results.\nArcosa faces aggressive competition in all geographic markets and each industry sector in which it operates. In addition to price, Arcosa faces competition in respect to product performance and technological innovation, quality, reliability of delivery, customer service, and other factors. The effects of this competition, which is often intense, could reduce Arcosa\u2019s revenues and operating profits, limit Arcosa\u2019s ability to grow, increase pricing pressure on Arcosa\u2019s products, and otherwise affect Arcosa\u2019s financial results.\nArcosa may be adversely affected by trade policies and practices, including trade practices of competitors that violate U.S. or other foreign laws, regulations, or practices.\nArcosa faces competition from manufacturers both in the U.S. and around the world, some of which may engage in competition and trade practices involving the importation of competing products into the U.S. in violation of U.S. or other foreign laws, regulations, or practices. For example, Arcosa\u2019s competitors import competing products that are subsidized by foreign governments and sold in the U.S. at less than fair value. The results of trade negotiations, trade agreements, and tariffs could also negatively affect Arcosa\u2019s supplies, cost of goods sold, and customers. These trade policies and practices could increase pricing pressure on\nArcosa\u2019s products, reduce Arcosa\u2019s revenues and operating profits, limit Arcosa\u2019s ability to grow, and otherwise adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s financial results.\nEquipment failures or extensive damage to Arcosa\u2019s facilities, including as might occur as a result of natural disasters, could lead to production, delivery or service curtailments or shutdowns, loss of revenue or higher expenses.\nArcosa operates a substantial amount of equipment at Arcosa\u2019s production facilities, several of which are situated in tornado and hurricane zones and on navigable waterways in the U.S. An interruption in production capabilities or maintenance and repair capabilities at Arcosa\u2019s facilities, as a result of equipment failure or acts of nature, including non-navigation orders resulting from excessive or low-water conditions issued from time to time by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on one or more U.S. rivers that serve Arcosa\u2019s facilities, could reduce or prevent Arcosa\u2019s production, delivery, service, or repair of Arcosa\u2019s products and increase Arcosa\u2019s costs and expenses. A halt of production at any of Arcosa\u2019s manufacturing facilities could severely affect delivery times to Arcosa\u2019s customers. While Arcosa maintains emergency response and business recovery plans that are intended to allow Arcosa to recover from natural disasters that could disrupt Arcosa\u2019s business, Arcosa cannot provide assurances that its plans would fully protect Arcosa from the effects of all such disasters. In addition, insurance may not adequately compensate Arcosa for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters, which may adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s financial condition. Any significant delay in deliveries not otherwise contractually mitigated by favorable force majeure or other provisions could result in cancellation of all or a portion of Arcosa\u2019s orders, cause Arcosa to lose future sales, and negatively affect Arcosa\u2019s reputation and Arcosa\u2019s results of operations.\nArcosa depends on its key management employees, and Arcosa may not be able to retain their services in the future.\nArcosa\u2019s success depends on the continued services of its executive team and key management employees, none of whom currently have an employment agreement with Arcosa. Arcosa may not be able to retain the services of its executives and key management in the future. The loss of the services of one or more executives or key members of Arcosa\u2019s management team, or Arcosa\u2019s inability to successfully develop talent for succession planning, could result in increased costs associated with attracting and retaining a replacement and could disrupt Arcosa\u2019s operations and result in a loss of revenues.\nA material disruption at one or more of Arcosa\u2019s manufacturing facilities or in Arcosa\u2019s supply chain could have a material adverse effect on us.\nArcosa owns and operates manufacturing facilities of various ages and levels of automated control and relies on a number of third parties as part of Arcosa\u2019s supply chain, including for the efficient distribution of products to Arcosa\u2019s customers. Any disruption at one of Arcosa\u2019s manufacturing facilities or within Arcosa\u2019s supply chain could prevent Arcosa from meeting demand or require Arcosa to incur unplanned capital expenditures. Older facilities are generally less energy-efficient and are at an increased risk of breakdown or equipment failure, resulting in unplanned downtime. Any unplanned downtime at Arcosa\u2019s facilities may cause delays in meeting customer timelines, result in liquidated damages claims, or cause Arcosa to lose or harm customer relationships.\nAdditionally, Arcosa requires specialized equipment to manufacture certain of its products, and if any of its manufacturing equipment fails, the time required to repair or replace this equipment could be lengthy, which could result in extended downtime at the affected facility. Any unplanned repair or replacement work can also be very expensive. Moreover, manufacturing facilities can unexpectedly stop operating because of events unrelated to Arcosa or beyond its control, including fires and other industrial accidents, floods and other severe weather events, natural disasters, environmental incidents or other catastrophes, utility and transportation infrastructure disruptions, shortages of raw materials, and acts of war or terrorism. Work stoppages, whether union-organized or not, can also disrupt operations at manufacturing facilities.\nFurthermore, any shortages in trucking capacity, any increase in the cost thereof, or any other disruption to the highway systems could limit Arcosa\u2019s ability to deliver its products in a timely manner or at all. Any material disruption at one or more of Arcosa\u2019s facilities or those of Arcosa\u2019s customers or suppliers or otherwise within Arcosa\u2019s supply chain, whether as a result of downtime, facility damage, an inability to deliver Arcosa\u2019s products or otherwise, could prevent Arcosa from meeting demand, require Arcosa to incur unplanned capital expenditures, or cause other material disruption to Arcosa\u2019s operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDelays in construction projects and any failure to manage Arcosa\u2019s inventory could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMany of Arcosa\u2019s products are used in large-scale construction projects which generally require a significant amount of planning and preparation before construction commences. However, construction projects can be delayed and rescheduled for a number of reasons, including unanticipated soil conditions, adverse weather or flooding, changes in project priorities, financing issues, difficulties in complying with environmental and other government regulations or obtaining permits, and additional time required to acquire rights-of-way or property rights. These delays or rescheduling may occur with too little notice to allow Arcosa to replace those projects in Arcosa\u2019s manufacturing schedules or to adjust production capacity accordingly, creating unplanned downtime, increasing costs and inefficiencies in Arcosa\u2019s operations, and increased levels of obsolete inventory.\nAdditionally, Arcosa maintains an inventory of certain products that meet standard specifications and are ultimately purchased by a variety of end users. Arcosa forecasts demand for these products to ensure that it keeps sufficient inventory levels of certain products that Arcosa expects to be in high demand and limits its inventory for which Arcosa does not expect much interest. However, Arcosa\u2019s forecasts are not always accurate and unexpected changes in demand for these products, whether because of a change in preferences or otherwise, can lead to increased levels of obsolete inventory. Any delays in construction projects and Arcosa\u2019s customers\u2019 orders or any inability to manage Arcosa\u2019s inventory could have a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe seasonality of Arcosa\u2019s business and its susceptibility to severe and prolonged periods of adverse weather and other conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nDemand for Arcosa\u2019s products in some markets is typically seasonal, with periods of snow or heavy rain negatively affecting construction activity. For example, sales of Arcosa\u2019s products in Canada and the Northeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. are somewhat higher from spring through autumn when construction activity is greatest. Construction activity declines in these markets during the winter months in particular due to inclement weather, frozen ground, and fewer hours of daylight. Construction activity can also be affected in any period by adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes, severe storms, torrential rains and floods, natural disasters such as fires and earthquakes, and similar events, any of which could reduce demand for Arcosa\u2019s products, push back existing orders to later dates or lead to cancellations.\nFurthermore, Arcosa\u2019s ability to deliver products on time or at all to Arcosa\u2019s customers can be significantly impeded by such conditions and events described above. Public holidays and vacation periods constitute an additional factor that may exacerbate certain seasonality effects, as building projects or industrial manufacturing processes may temporarily cease. These conditions, particularly when unanticipated, can leave both equipment and personnel underutilized.\nAdditionally, the seasonal nature of Arcosa\u2019s business has led to variation in Arcosa\u2019s quarterly results in the past and is expected to continue to do so in the future. This general seasonality of Arcosa\u2019s business and any severe or prolonged adverse weather conditions or other similar events could have a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks related to Arcosa\u2019s operations outside of the U.S., particularly Mexico, could decrease Arcosa\u2019s profitability.\nArcosa\u2019s operations outside of the U.S. are subject to the risks associated with cross-border business transactions and activities. Political, legal, trade, economic change or instability, criminal activities or social unrest could limit or curtail Arcosa\u2019s respective foreign business activities and operations, including the ability to hire and retain employees. Violence in Mexico associated with drug trafficking is continuing. Arcosa has not, to date, been materially affected by any of these risks, but Arcosa cannot predict the likelihood of future effects from such risks or any resulting adverse impact on Arcosa\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition. Arcosa ships raw materials to Mexico and manufactures products in Mexico that are sold in the U.S. or elsewhere, which are subject to customs and other regulations and the transportation and import of such products may be disrupted. Some foreign countries where Arcosa operates have regulatory authorities that regulate products sold or used in those countries. If Arcosa fails to comply with the applicable regulations related to the foreign countries where Arcosa operates, Arcosa may be unable to market and sell its products in those countries or could be subject to administrative fines or penalties.\nIn addition, with respect to operations in Mexico and other foreign countries, unexpected changes in the political environment, laws, rules, and regulatory requirements; tariffs and other trade barriers, including regulatory initiatives for buying goods produced in America; more stringent or restrictive laws, rules and regulations relating to labor or the environment; adverse tax consequences; price exchange controls and restrictions; regulations affecting cross-border rail and vehicular traffic; or availability of commodities, including gasoline and electricity, could limit operations affecting production throughput and making the manufacture and distribution of Arcosa\u2019s products less timely or more difficult.\nFurthermore, any material change in the quotas, regulations or duties on imports imposed by the U.S. government and agencies or on exports by the government of Mexico or its agencies, could affect Arcosa\u2019s ability to export products that Arcosa manufactures in Mexico. Failure to comply with such import and export regulations could result in significant fines and penalties.\nBecause Arcosa has operations outside the U.S., Arcosa could be adversely affected by final judgments of non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d) or import/export rules and regulations and similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or import/export laws of other countries.\nPotential expansion of our business may expose us to new business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks associated with such expansion, both inside and outside of the U.S.\nPreviously, we have expanded and plan in the future to expand our business and operations, and this expansion may involve expansion into markets (either inside or outside the U.S.) in which we have limited operating experience, including with respect to seeking regulatory approvals, becoming subject to regulatory authorities, and marketing or selling products. Further, our operations in new foreign markets may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policy; financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty in collecting from international customers,\nthe effect of local and regional financial crises and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and controls; multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses; interest rates and taxation laws and policies; increased government regulation; social stability; and political, economic, or diplomatic developments. Certain jurisdictions have, from time to time, experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities, both internally and with neighboring countries. Rioting, military activity, terrorist attacks, or armed hostilities could cause our operations in such jurisdictions to be adversely affected or suspended. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, military conflicts, and wars.\nIn addition, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws may conflict with some local customs and practices in foreign jurisdictions. Our operations in international jurisdictions may be adversely affected by regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, including both its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions. As a result of our policy to comply with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not subject to, or do not comply with, such laws\nAny of these factors could significantly harm our potential business or international expansion and our operations and, consequently, our revenues, costs, results of operations, and financial condition.\nArcosa may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nArcosa is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Under varying circumstances, Arcosa may seek to minimize these risks through the use of hedges and similar financial instruments and other activities, although these measures, if and when implemented, may not be effective. Any material and untimely changes in interest rates or exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nThe loss of revenues attributable to one of our customers could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.\nGE, a customer in our Energy Equipment Group, accounted for approximately 18.2% of our consolidated revenues in 2019. The loss of revenues attributable to this customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nArcosa may not be able to successfully identify, consummate or integrate acquisitions, and acquisitions may bring additional known and unknown risks to Arcosa\u2019s business.\nArcosa expects to routinely engage in the search for growth opportunities, including assessment of merger and acquisition prospects in new markets and/or products. However, Arcosa may not be able to identify and secure suitable opportunities. Arcosa\u2019s ability to consummate any acquisitions on terms that are favorable to Arcosa may be limited by a number of factors, such as competition for attractive targets and, to the extent necessary, Arcosa\u2019s ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nIn addition, any merger or acquisition into which Arcosa may enter (including the Cherry acquisition) is subject to known and unknown risks of such business, markets and/or products and integrating such business, markets, and/or products into Arcosa\u2019s businesses and culture. The failure to successfully integrate such mergers or acquisitions could prevent Arcosa from achieving the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits from such transactions.\nThe Cherry acquisition brings known and unknown risks to Arcosa, and Arcosa may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Cherry or those benefits may be delayed, including due to difficulties integrating Cherry and Arcosa.\nCherry is bringing new lines of businesses to Arcosa, including demolition and recycling services. These new lines of businesses involve known and unknown risks. If any of these risks occur, they could result in a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s business, operations, or financial condition. In addition, some or all of Arcosa\u2019s anticipated benefits from the Cherry acquisition may not be realized. Some of these benefits may not be realized due to Cherry\u2019s concentration in the Houston, Texas-area market. A downturn in this market could have a disproportionate adverse impact on Cherry's business, operations, or financial condition. If Arcosa is not able to successfully integrate Cherry to any material degree, such failure of a successful integration could result in unexpected claims or otherwise have a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s business, operations, or financial condition. Integration risks include the following: (i) the diversion of management\u2019s time and resources to integration matters from other Arcosa matters; (ii) difficulties in achieving business opportunities and growth prospects of Cherry; (iii) difficulties in managing the expanded operations; and (iv) challenges in retaining key personnel.\nSome of Arcosa\u2019s customers place orders for Arcosa\u2019s products (i) in reliance on their ability to utilize tax benefits or tax credits such as accelerated depreciation or the production tax credit for renewable energy or (ii) to utilize federal-aid programs that allow for purchase price reimbursement or other government funding or subsidies, any of which benefits, credits, or programs could be or are being discontinued or allowed to expire without extension thereby reducing demand for certain of Arcosa\u2019s products.\nThere is no assurance that the U.S. government will reauthorize, modify, or otherwise not allow the expiration of tax benefits, tax credits, subsidies, or federal-aid programs that may include funding of the purchase or purchase price reimbursement of certain of Arcosa\u2019s products. For example, the federal renewable electricity production tax credit (\u201cthe PTC\u201d) for wind energy facilities was scheduled to expire at the end of calendar year 2019; however, just prior to expiration, it was extended for one year. Pricing\nof orders and individual order quantities reflect a market transitioning from the PTC incentives. In instances where any benefits, credits, subsidies, or programs are allowed to expire or are otherwise modified or discontinued, the demand for Arcosa\u2019s products could decrease, thereby creating the potential for a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s financial condition or results of operations and could result in non-cash impairments on long-lived assets, including intangible assets, and/or goodwill.\nArcosa\u2019s access to capital may be limited or unavailable due to deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets and/or weakening of macroeconomic conditions.\nIn general, Arcosa may rely upon banks and capital markets to fund its growth strategy. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be constrained for extended periods of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, a number of other factors could cause Arcosa to incur increased borrowing costs and have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for both secured and unsecured debt, which factors include Arcosa\u2019s financial performance. If Arcosa is unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, Arcosa\u2019s other sources of funds, including available cash, its committed bank facility, and cash flow from operations may not be adequate to fund its operations and contractual commitments and refinance existing debt.\nArcosa's indebtedness restricts its current and future operations, which could adversely affect its ability to respond to changes in its business and manage its operations.\nOn January 2, 2020, Arcosa entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), by and among Arcosa, as borrower, and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement includes a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on Arcosa, including restrictions on its and its guarantors' ability to, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, merge or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, engage in transactions with affiliates and make certain restricted payments. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires Arcosa to comply with financial covenants. The Credit Agreement requires that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of no less than 2.50 to 1.00 and maximum leverage ratio of no greater than 3.00 to 1.00, subject to certain exceptions, in each case, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of Arcosa.\nFor more information on the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Arcosa's ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on Arcosa's business by limiting its ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition, or other opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Credit Agreement.\nThe phaseout of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate may have an adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s business.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established or if alternative benchmark reference rates will be adopted. Arcosa\u2019s revolving credit facility, term loan, and other financial instruments utilize LIBOR or an alternative benchmark reference rate for calculating the applicable interest rate. After LIBOR is phased out, the interest rates for these obligations might be subject to change. The replacement of LIBOR with an alternative benchmark reference rate may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs under Arcosa\u2019s current or future credit agreements and financial instruments. This could materially and adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, ability to acquire debt financing and liquidity. Arcosa cannot predict the effect of the elimination of LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative benchmark reference rates and the corresponding effects on Arcosa\u2019s cost of capital.\nFluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and parts and components used in the production of Arcosa\u2019s products and the availability of natural aggregates and specialty materials reserves could have a material adverse effect on its ability to cost-effectively manufacture and sell its products. In some instances, Arcosa relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, parts and components needed in its production.\nA significant portion of Arcosa\u2019s business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty and other parts and components at competitive prices such as flanges for the structural wind towers business. Arcosa\u2019s manufacturing operations partially depend on Arcosa\u2019s ability to obtain timely deliveries of raw materials, parts, and components in acceptable quantities and quality from Arcosa\u2019s suppliers. Certain raw materials, parts, and components for Arcosa\u2019s products are currently available from a limited number of suppliers and, as a result, Arcosa may have limited control over pricing, availability, and delivery schedules. If Arcosa is unable to purchase a sufficient quantity of raw materials, parts, and components on a timely basis, Arcosa could face disruptions in its production and incur delays while Arcosa attempts to engage alternative suppliers. Fewer suppliers could result from unimproved or worsening economic or commercial conditions, potentially increasing Arcosa\u2019s rejections for poor quality and requiring Arcosa to source unknown and distant supply alternatives. Any such disruption or conditions could harm Arcosa\u2019s business and adversely impact Arcosa\u2019s results of operations.\nThe principal material used in Arcosa\u2019s manufacturing segments is steel. Market steel prices may exhibit periods of volatility. Steel prices may experience further volatility as a result of scrap surcharges assessed by steel mills, tariffs, and other market factors. Arcosa often uses contract-specific purchasing practices, supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with Arcosa\u2019s customers to mitigate the effect of this volatility on Arcosa\u2019s operating profits for the year. To the extent that Arcosa does not have such arrangements in place, a change in steel prices could materially lower Arcosa\u2019s profitability. In addition, meeting production demands is dependent on Arcosa\u2019s ability to obtain a sufficient amount of steel. An unanticipated interruption in Arcosa\u2019s supply chain could have an adverse impact on both Arcosa\u2019s margins and production schedules.\nA part of the operations in Arcosa\u2019s Construction Products Group includes the mining of natural aggregates and specialty materials reserves. The success and viability of these operations depend on the accuracy of Arcosa\u2019s reserve estimates, the costs of production and the ability to economically distribute the natural aggregates and specialty materials. Estimates for natural aggregate and specialty materials reserves and for the costs of production of such reserves depend upon a variety of factors and assumptions, many of which involve uncertainties beyond Arcosa\u2019s control, such as geological and mining conditions that may not be identifiable. In addition, Arcosa's success in recovering natural aggregates and specialty materials depends on the ability to secure new reserve locations and permits to mine such reserves in areas that make distribution of materials economically viable. Inaccuracies in reserve estimates and production costs, and the inability to secure locations and permits for future operations could negatively affect our results of operations.\nReductions in the availability of energy supplies or an increase in energy costs may increase Arcosa\u2019s operating costs.\nArcosa uses electricity and various gases, including natural gas, at Arcosa\u2019s manufacturing facilities and uses diesel fuel in vehicles to transport Arcosa\u2019s products to customers and to operate its plant equipment. An outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the U.S. and any foreign power and, in particular, prolonged conflicts could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and/or natural gas, which could result in an increase in the cost of natural gas or energy in general. Extreme weather conditions and natural occurrences such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods could result in varying states of disaster and a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and/or natural gas, including rationing thereof, potentially resulting in unavailability or an increase in natural gas prices, electricity prices, or other general energy costs. Speculative trading in energy futures in the world markets could also result in an increase in natural gas and general energy cost. Future limitations on the availability (including limitations imposed by increased regulation or restrictions on rail, road, and pipeline transportation of energy supplies) or consumption of petroleum products and/or an increase in energy costs, particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles and plant equipment, could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct Arcosa\u2019s business cost effectively.\nThe inability to hire and retain skilled labor could adversely impact Arcosa\u2019s operations.\nArcosa depends on skilled labor in the manufacture, maintenance, and repair of Arcosa\u2019s products. Some of Arcosa\u2019s facilities are located in areas where demand for skilled laborers may exceed supply. If Arcosa is unable to hire and retain these skilled laborers, including welders, Arcosa may be limited in its ability to maintain or increase production rates and could increase Arcosa\u2019s labor costs.\nSome of Arcosa\u2019s employees belong to labor unions and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s operations.\nArcosa is a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions at some of Arcosa\u2019s operations in the U.S. and Canada and all of Arcosa\u2019s operations in Mexico. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or Arcosa\u2019s potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions in the future could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, or other slowdowns by the affected workers. Arcosa cannot be assured that its relations with its workforce will remain positive or that union organizers will not be successful in future attempts to organize at some of Arcosa\u2019s facilities. If Arcosa\u2019s workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown or other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, Arcosa could experience a significant disruption of its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. In addition, Arcosa could face higher labor costs in the future as a result of severance or other charges associated with lay-offs, shutdowns, or reductions in the size and scope of its operations or difficulties of restarting Arcosa\u2019s operations that have been temporarily shuttered.\nOur business is subject to significant regulatory compliance burdens in the U.S., Mexico, and other countries where we do business.\nWe are subject to various governmental regulations in the U.S., Mexico, and other countries where we do business related to occupational safety and health, labor, and business practices. Failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alterations of our production processes, cessation of operations, or other actions which could harm our business.\nAlthough we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable regulations material to our business operations, amendments to existing statutes and regulations, adoption of new statutes and regulations or entering into new lines of business could require us to continually alter our methods of operation and/or discontinue the sale of certain of our products resulting in costs to us that could be substantial. We may not be able, for financial or other reasons, to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and permit requirements. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations or permit requirements could\nsubject us to civil remedies, including substantial fines, penalties, and injunctions, as well as possible criminal sanctions, which would, if of significant magnitude, materially adversely impact our operations and future financial condition.\nViolations of or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which Arcosa operates or will operate may have a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nArcosa\u2019s Transportation Products Group is subject to regulation by, among others, the U.S. Coast Guard; the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board; the U.S. Customs Service; the Maritime Administration of the USDOT and private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping. These organizations establish safety criteria, investigate vessel accidents, and recommend improved safety standards.\nArcosa\u2019s Construction Products Group is subject to regulation by MSHA, USEPA, FDA, and various state agencies.\nArcosa\u2019s Energy Equipment Group is subject to the regulations by the PHMSA and the FMCSA, both of which are part of the USDOT; and various state agencies. These agencies promulgate and enforce rules and regulations pertaining, in part, to the manufacture of tanks that are used in the storage, transportation and transport arrangement, and distribution of regulated and non-regulated substances.\nArcosa\u2019s operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by OSHA and MSHA. In addition, our business is subject to additional regulatory requirements in Mexico and other countries where we conduct business.\nFuture regulatory changes, new lines of business which are covered by regulatory agencies that Arcosa has not previously been subject to, or the determination that Arcosa\u2019s current or future products or processes are not in compliance with applicable requirements, rules, regulations, specifications, standards or product testing criteria might result in additional operating expenses, administrative fines or penalties, product recalls, reputational harm, or loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s financial condition and operations. For example, the U.S. barge industry relies, in part, on the Jones Act, and changes to or a repeal of the legislation could have a material adverse impact on Arcosa\u2019s barge business and revenues. In addition, the impact of a government shutdown could have a material adverse effect on Arcosa's revenues, profits, and cash flows. Arcosa relies on government personnel to conduct certain routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of certain products that, if disrupted, could have an immediate impact on Arcosa's revenues and business.\nArcosa is subject to health and safety laws and regulations and any failure to comply with any current or future laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.\nManufacturing and construction sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. Arcosa\u2019s manufacturing sites often put Arcosa\u2019s employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, heavy products and other items, and highly regulated materials. As a result, Arcosa is subject to a variety of health and safety laws and regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. Unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover and raise Arcosa\u2019s operating costs. Arcosa\u2019s safety record can also impact Arcosa\u2019s reputation. Arcosa maintains functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure Arcosa implements effective work procedures throughout Arcosa\u2019s organization and take other steps to ensure the health and safety of Arcosa\u2019s work force, but there can be no assurances these measures will be successful in preventing injuries or violations of health and safety laws and regulations. Any failure to maintain safe work sites or violations of applicable health and safety laws could expose Arcosa to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEmployment related lawsuits could be brought against us, which could be expensive, time consuming, and result in substantial damages to us.\nArcosa may become subject to substantial and costly litigation by its former and current employees related to improper termination of employment, sexual harassment, hostile work environment, and other employment-related claims. Such claims could divert management\u2019s attention from Arcosa\u2019s core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against Arcosa. Arcosa\u2019s current insurance coverage is limited and may not apply or may not be sufficient to cover these claims. Any employment related claims brought against Arcosa, with or without merit, could harm Arcosa\u2019s reputation in the industry and reduce product sales. Damages assessed against Arcosa could have a material adverse impact on Arcosa\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nArcosa has potential exposure to environmental liabilities that may increase costs and lower profitability.\nArcosa is subject to comprehensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to: (i) the release or discharge of regulated materials into the environment at Arcosa\u2019s facilities or with respect to Arcosa\u2019s products while in operation; (ii) the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport and transport arrangement, and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, substances, and materials; and (iii) other activities relating to the protection of human health and the environment. Such laws and regulations expose Arcosa to liability for its own acts and in certain instances potentially expose Arcosa to liability for the acts of others. These laws and regulations also may impose liability on Arcosa currently under circumstances where at the time of the action taken, Arcosa\u2019s acts or those of others complied with then applicable laws and\nregulations. In addition, such laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance, and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Arcosa\u2019s operations involving hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law.\nEnvironmental operating permits are, or may be, required for Arcosa\u2019s operations under these laws and regulations. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation. Although Arcosa regularly monitors and reviews its operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with Arcosa\u2019s operating permits and related laws and regulations, the risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of Arcosa\u2019s businesses.\nHowever, future events, such as changes in, or modified interpretations of, existing environmental laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards associated with the manufacture of Arcosa\u2019s products and related business activities and properties, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s financial condition and operations.\nIn addition to environmental laws, the transportation of commodities by rail, barge, or container raises potential risks in the event of an accident that results in the release of an environmentally sensitive substance. Generally, liability under existing laws for an accident depends upon causation analysis and the acts, errors, or omissions, if any, of a party involved in the transportation activity, including, but not limited to, the shipper, the buyer, and the seller of the substances being transported, or the manufacturer of the barge, container, or its components. Additionally, the severity of injury or property damage arising from an incident may influence the causation responsibility analysis, exposing Arcosa to potentially greater liability. Under certain circumstances, strict liability concepts may apply. If Arcosa is found liable in any such incidents, it could have a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s financial condition, business, and operations.\nResponding to claims relating to improper handling, transport, storage, or disposal of hazardous materials could be time consuming and costly.\nWe use controlled hazardous materials in our business and generate wastes that are regulated as hazardous wastes under U.S. federal, state, and local environmental laws and under equivalent provisions of law in those and other jurisdictions in which our manufacturing facilities are located. Our use of these substances and materials is subject to stringent, and periodically changing, regulation that can impose costly compliance obligations on us and have the potential to adversely affect our manufacturing activities. We are also subject to potential liability for claims alleging property damage and personal and bodily injury or death arising from the use of or exposure to our products, especially in connection with products we manufacture that our customers use to transport or store hazardous, flammable, toxic, or explosive materials.\nThe risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. If an accident with these substances occurs, we could be held liable for any damages that result, as well as incurring clean-up costs and liabilities, which can be substantial. Additionally, an accident could damage our facilities, resulting in delays and increased costs.\nOur manufacturing plants or other facilities may have unknown environmental conditions that could be expensive and time-consuming to correct.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not encounter hazardous environmental conditions at any of our manufacturing plants or other facilities that may require us to incur significant clean-up or correction costs. Upon encountering a hazardous environmental condition or receiving a notice of a hazardous environmental condition, we may be required to correct the condition. The presence of a hazardous environmental condition relating to any of our manufacturing plants or other facilities may require significant expenditures to correct the environmental condition.\nBusiness, regulatory, and legal developments regarding climate change, and physical impacts from climate change, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations.\nLegislation and new rules to regulate emission of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) has been introduced in numerous state legislatures, the U.S. Congress, and by the USEPA. Some of these proposals would require industries to meet new standards that may require substantial reductions in carbon emissions. There is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation that could adversely impact the cost of certain manufacturing inputs, including the cost of energy and electricity. While Arcosa cannot assess the direct impact of these or other potential regulations, new climate change protocols could affect demand for its products and/or affect the price of materials, input factors, energy costs, and manufactured components.\nPotential impacts of climate change include physical impacts, such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events, shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities, and sea level changes. Other adverse consequences of climate change could include an increased frequency of severe weather events, flooding, and rising sea levels that could affect operations at Arcosa\u2019s manufacturing facilities as well as the price of insuring Company assets or other unforeseen disruptions of Arcosa\u2019s operations, systems, property, or equipment.\nThe impacts of climate change and related regulations on our operations and the Company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate, but such effects could be materially adverse to our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nArcosa may be required to reduce the value of Arcosa\u2019s long-lived assets, including intangible assets, and/or goodwill, which would weaken Arcosa\u2019s financial results.\nArcosa periodically evaluates for potential impairment the carrying values of Arcosa\u2019s long-lived assets, including intangible assets, to be held and used. The carrying value of a long-lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced commensurate with the estimated cost to dispose of the assets. In addition, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis whenever events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the goodwill might be impaired.\nCertain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction, changes in market interest rates, or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Any impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets recorded in connection with previous acquisitions will result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, shareholder\u2019s equity, and/or share price.\nChanges in accounting policies or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in the application of accounting policies could adversely affect the reported value of Arcosa\u2019s assets or liabilities and financial results.\nArcosa\u2019s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The significant accounting policies, together with the other notes that follow, are an integral part of the financial statements. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of Arcosa\u2019s assets or liabilities and financial results and require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and Arcosa\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm) may amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how Arcosa records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, Arcosa could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements. For a further discussion of some of Arcosa\u2019s critical accounting policies and standards and recent accounting changes, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and Note 1 \u201cOverview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.\nFrom time to time Arcosa may take tax positions that the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), the Servicio de Administracion Tributaria (\u201cSAT\u201d) in Mexico, or other taxing jurisdictions may contest.\nOur subsidiaries have in the past and may in the future take tax positions that the IRS, the SAT, or other taxing jurisdictions may challenge. Arcosa is required to disclose to the IRS as part of Arcosa\u2019s tax returns particular tax positions in which Arcosa has a reasonable basis for the position but not a \u201cmore likely than not\u201d chance of prevailing. If the IRS, SAT, or other taxing jurisdictions successfully contests a tax position that Arcosa takes, Arcosa may be required to pay additional taxes or fines which may not have been previously accrued that may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.\nThe limited number of customers for certain of Arcosa\u2019s products, the variable purchase patterns of Arcosa\u2019s customers in all of its segments, and the timing of completion, delivery, and customer acceptance of orders may cause Arcosa\u2019s revenues and income from operations to vary substantially each quarter, potentially resulting in significant fluctuations in its quarterly results.\nSome of the markets Arcosa serves have a limited number of customers. The volumes purchased by customers in each of Arcosa\u2019s business segments vary from year to year, and not all customers make purchases every year. As a result, the order levels for Arcosa\u2019s products have varied significantly from quarterly period to quarterly period in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future. Therefore, Arcosa\u2019s results of operations in any particular quarterly period may also vary. As a result of these quarterly fluctuations, Arcosa believes that comparisons of its sales and operating results between quarterly periods may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nSome of Arcosa\u2019s products are sold to contractors, distributors, installers, and rental companies who may misuse, abuse, improperly install, or improperly or inadequately maintain or repair such products, thereby potentially exposing Arcosa to claims that could increase Arcosa\u2019s costs and weaken Arcosa\u2019s financial condition.\nThe products Arcosa manufactures are designed to work optimally when properly assembled, operated, installed, repaired, and maintained. When this does not occur, Arcosa may be subjected to claims or litigation associated with personal or bodily injuries or death and property damage.\nU.S. government actions relative to the federal budget, taxation policies, government expenditures, U.S. borrowing/debt ceiling limits, and trade policies could adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s business and operating results.\nPeriods of impasse, deadlock, and last minute accords may continue to permeate many aspects of U.S. governance, including federal government budgeting and spending, taxation, U.S. deficit spending and debt ceiling adjustments, and international commerce. Such periods could negatively impact U.S. domestic and global financial markets, thereby reducing customer demand for Arcosa\u2019s products and services and potentially result in reductions in Arcosa\u2019s revenues, increased price competition, or increased operating costs, any of which could adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFor example, Arcosa produces many of its products at its manufacturing facilities in Mexico. Arcosa\u2019s business benefits from free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). The U.S., Mexico and Canada have reached a U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d) which would replace NAFTA. The USMCA would maintain duty-free access for many products. The USMCA still requires approval from Canada\u2019s Parliament before it takes effect. It is uncertain what the outcome of the approval process and any further negotiations will be, but it is possible that additional revisions to USMCA or failure to secure approvals could adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s existing production operations in Mexico and have a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nArcosa\u2019s business is based in part on government-funded infrastructure projects and building activities, and any reductions or re-allocation of spending or related subsidies in these areas could have an adverse effect on us.\nCertain of Arcosa\u2019s businesses depend on government spending for infrastructure and other similar building activities. As a result, demand for some of Arcosa\u2019s products is influenced by U.S. federal government fiscal policies and tax incentives and other subsidies. Projects in which Arcosa participates may be funded directly by governments or privately-funded, but are otherwise tied to or impacted by government policies and spending measures.\nGovernment infrastructure spending and governmental policies with respect thereto depend primarily on the availability of public funds, which is influenced by many factors, including governmental budgets; public debt levels; interest rates; existing and anticipated and actual federal, state, provincial, and local tax revenues; government leadership; and the general political climate, as well as other general macroeconomic and political factors. In addition, U.S. federal government funds may only be available based on states\u2019 willingness to provide matching funding. Government spending is often approved only on a short-term basis and some of the projects in which Arcosa\u2019s products are used require longer-term funding commitments. If government funding is not approved or funding is lowered as a result of poor economic conditions, lower than expected revenues, competing spending priorities or other factors, it could limit infrastructure projects available, increase competition for projects, result in excess inventory, and decrease sales, all of which could adversely affect the profitability of Arcosa\u2019s business.\nAdditionally, certain regions or states may require or possess the means to finance only a limited number of large infrastructure projects and periods of high demand may be followed by years of little to no activity. There can be no assurances that governments will sustain or increase current infrastructure spending and tax incentive and other subsidy levels, and any reductions thereto or delays therein could affect Arcosa\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLitigated disputes and other claims could increase Arcosa\u2019s costs and weaken Arcosa\u2019s financial condition.\nArcosa is currently, and may from time to time be, involved in various claims or legal proceedings arising out of Arcosa\u2019s operations. Adverse judgments and outcomes in some or all of these matters could result in significant losses and costs that could weaken Arcosa\u2019s financial condition. Although Arcosa maintains reserves for its probable and reasonably estimable liability, Arcosa\u2019s reserves may be inadequate to cover its portion of claims or final judgments after taking into consideration rights in indemnity and recourse under insurance policies or to third parties as a result of which there could be a material adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s business, operations, or financial condition.\nArcosa\u2019s manufacturer\u2019s warranties expose Arcosa to product replacement and repair claims.\nDepending on the product, Arcosa warrants its workmanship and certain materials (including surface coatings), parts, and components pursuant to express limited contractual warranties. Arcosa may be subject to significant warranty claims in the future, such as multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout Arcosa\u2019s production process or claims for which the cost of shipping, repairing, or replacing the defective part, component, or material is highly disproportionate to the original price. These types of warranty claims could result in significant costs associated with product recalls or product shipping, repair, or replacement, and damage to Arcosa\u2019s reputation.\nDefects in materials and workmanship could harm our reputation, expose us to product warranty or product liability claims, decrease demand for products, or materially harm existing or prospective customer relationships.\nA defect in materials or in the manufacturing of our products could result in product warranty and product liability claims, decrease demand for products, or materially harm existing or prospective customer relationships. These claims may require costly repairs or replacement and may include cost related to disassembly of our products and transportation of the products from the field to our facilities and returning the products to the customer, a change in our manufacturing processes, recall of previously manufactured products, or personal injury claims, which could result in significant expense and materially harm our existing or\nprospective customer relationships. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIncreasing insurance claims and expenses could lower profitability and increase business risk.\nArcosa is subject to potential liability for claims alleging property damage and personal and bodily injury or death arising from the use of or exposure to Arcosa\u2019s products, especially in connection with products Arcosa manufactures that Arcosa\u2019s customers use to transport hazardous, flammable, toxic, or explosive materials. As policies expire, premiums for renewed or new coverage may further increase and/or require that Arcosa increase its self-insured retention or deductibles. Arcosa maintains primary coverage and excess coverage policies. If the number of claims or the dollar amounts of any such claims rise in any policy year, Arcosa could suffer additional costs associated with accessing its excess coverage policies. Also, an increase in the loss amounts attributable to such claims could expose Arcosa to uninsured damages if Arcosa were unable or elected not to insure against certain claims because of high premiums or other reasons. While Arcosa\u2019s liability insurance coverage is at or above levels based on commercial norms in Arcosa\u2019s industries, an unusually large liability claim or a string of claims coupled with an unusually large damage award could exceed Arcosa\u2019s available insurance coverage. In addition, the availability of, and Arcosa\u2019s ability to collect on, insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond Arcosa\u2019s control, including positions on policy coverage taken by insurers. If any of Arcosa\u2019s third-party insurers fail, cancel, or refuse coverage or otherwise are unable to provide Arcosa with adequate insurance coverage, then Arcosa\u2019s risk exposure and Arcosa\u2019s operational expenses may increase and the management of its business operations would be disrupted. Moreover, any accident or incident involving Arcosa\u2019s industries in general or Arcosa or Arcosa\u2019s products specifically, even if Arcosa is fully insured, contractually indemnified, or not held to be liable, could negatively affect Arcosa\u2019s reputation among customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for Arcosa to compete effectively, and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future.\nArcosa\u2019s inability to produce and disseminate relevant and/or reliable data and information pertaining to Arcosa\u2019s business in an efficient, cost-effective, secure, and well-controlled fashion may have significant negative impacts on confidentiality requirements and obligations and trade secret or other proprietary needs and expectations and, therefore, Arcosa\u2019s future operations, profitability, and competitive position.\nArcosa relies on information technology infrastructure and architecture, including hardware, network including the cloud, software, people, and processes to provide useful and confidential information to conduct Arcosa\u2019s business in the ordinary course, including correspondence and commercial data and information interchange with customers, suppliers, legal counsel, governmental agencies, and consultants and to support assessments and conclusions about future plans and initiatives pertaining to market demands, operating performance, and competitive positioning. Any material failure, interruption of service, compromised data security, or cybersecurity threat could adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s relations with suppliers and customers, place Arcosa in violation of confidentiality and data protection laws, rules, and regulations, and result in negative impacts to Arcosa\u2019s market share, operations, and profitability. Arcosa will have to continually upgrade its infrastructure and applications, to reduce the risk of such material failures, interruptions, or security breaches. Security breaches in Arcosa\u2019s information technology could result in theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential data, trade secrets, or other proprietary or intellectual property that could adversely impact Arcosa\u2019s future results.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the compromise of confidential information.\nOur business is at risk from and may be impacted by information security incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data, ransomware, malware, phishing emails, and other electronic security events. Such incidents can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. They can also result from internal compromises, such as human error, or malicious acts. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect, and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber event. Arcosa will have to continually upgrade its network infrastructure to reduce the risk of such cyber events. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and compromise confidential information belonging to us and third parties.\nRepercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm Arcosa\u2019s business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts, and other armed conflict involving the U.S. or its interests abroad may adversely affect the U.S. and global economies, potentially preventing Arcosa from meeting its financial and other obligations. In particular, the negative impacts of these events may affect the industries in which Arcosa operates. This could result in delays in or cancellations of the purchase of Arcosa\u2019s products or shortages in raw materials, parts, or components. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on Arcosa\u2019s operating results, revenues, costs, and financial condition.\nArcosa\u2019s inability to sufficiently protect Arcosa\u2019s intellectual property rights could adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s business.\nArcosa\u2019s patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights are important to Arcosa\u2019s success. Arcosa relies on patent, copyright, and trademark law, and trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with others to protect Arcosa\u2019s intellectual property rights. Arcosa\u2019s trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets may be exposed to market confusion, commercial abuse, infringement, or misappropriation and possibly challenged, invalidated, circumvented, narrowed, or declared unenforceable by countries where Arcosa\u2019s products and services are made\navailable, including countries where the laws may not protect Arcosa\u2019s intellectual property rights as fully as in the U.S. Such instances could negatively impact Arcosa\u2019s competitive position and adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s business. Additionally, Arcosa could be required to incur significant expenses to protect its intellectual property rights.\nRisks Related to the Separation.\nArcosa may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation, and the Separation may adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s business.\nArcosa may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation is expected to provide the following benefits, among others:\n\u2022\nallow Arcosa to more effectively pursue its own distinct operating priorities and strategies, enable Arcosa's management to pursue its own separate opportunities for long-term growth and profitability and to recruit, retain, and motivate employees pursuant to compensation policies which are appropriate for Arcosa's lines of business;\n\u2022\npermit Arcosa to concentrate its financial resources solely on its own operations, providing greater flexibility to invest capital in its business in a time and manner appropriate for its distinct strategy and business needs; and\n\u2022\nenable investors to evaluate the merits, performance, and future prospects of Arcosa's businesses and to invest in Arcosa separately based on these distinct characteristics.\nArcosa may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (a) the transition to being a stand-alone public company has required and will continue to require significant amounts of management\u2019s time and effort, which may divert management\u2019s attention from operating and growing Arcosa\u2019s business; (b) Arcosa\u2019s stock price may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other events particular to one or more of Arcosa\u2019s products than if it were still a part of Trinity; and (c) Arcosa\u2019s operational and financial profile changed such that Arcosa\u2019s diversification of revenue sources diminished, and Arcosa\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, working capital, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility than prior to the Separation. Additionally, Arcosa may experience unanticipated competitive developments, including changes in the conditions of Arcosa\u2019s infrastructure-related businesses\u2019 markets that could negate the expected benefits from the Separation. If Arcosa does not realize some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, the business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Arcosa could be adversely affected.\nArcosa has only operated as an independent, publicly-traded company since November 1, 2018, and its historical financial information for the periods prior to the Separation is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate, publicly-traded company and therefore may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.\nThe historical information about Arcosa in this report includes Arcosa\u2019s business as operated by and integrated with Trinity prior to the Separation. Arcosa\u2019s historical financial information included in this report for the periods prior to the Separation is derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of Trinity. Accordingly, such historical financial information included in this report does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows that Arcosa would have achieved as a separate, publicly-traded company during the periods presented prior to the Separation or those that Arcosa will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below:\n\u2022\nArcosa will need to make investments to replicate or outsource certain systems, infrastructure, and functional expertise after its Separation from Trinity. These initiatives to develop Arcosa\u2019s independent ability to operate without access to Trinity\u2019s existing operational and administrative infrastructure will be costly to implement. Arcosa may not be able to operate its business efficiently or at comparable costs, and its profitability may decline; and\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation, Arcosa relied upon Trinity for working capital requirements and other cash requirements, including in connection with Arcosa\u2019s previous acquisitions. Subsequent to the Separation, Trinity no longer provides Arcosa with funds to finance Arcosa\u2019s working capital or other cash requirements. Arcosa\u2019s access to and cost of debt financing may be different from the historical access to and cost of debt financing under Trinity. Differences in access to and cost of debt financing may result in differences in the interest rate charged to Arcosa on financings, as well as the amounts of indebtedness, types of financing structures, and debt markets that may be available to Arcosa, which could have an adverse effect on Arcosa\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFor additional information about the past financial performance of Arcosa\u2019s business and the basis of presentation of the historical combined financial statements of Arcosa\u2019s business, see \u201cItem 6. Selected Financial Data,\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d as well as the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included elsewhere in this report.\nTrinity may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation or Arcosa may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when Trinity is no longer obligated to provide services under the various agreements.\nThe separation and distribution agreement and other agreements entered into in connection with the Separation determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services for a period of time after the Separation. Arcosa is relying on Trinity to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Trinity is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, Arcosa could incur operational difficulties or losses.\nIf Arcosa does not have in place its own systems and services, and does not have agreements with other providers of these services when the transitional or other agreements terminate, or if Arcosa does not implement the new systems or replace Trinity\u2019s services successfully, Arcosa may not be able to operate its business effectively, which could disrupt its business and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. These systems and services may also be more expensive to install, implement and operate, or less efficient than the systems and services Trinity is expected to provide during the transition period.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Trinity pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially and adversely affect Arcosa\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe separation and distribution agreement, among other things, provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Arcosa financially responsible for certain liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities. If Arcosa is required to indemnify Trinity under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, Arcosa may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nArcosa may be subject to certain contingent liabilities of Trinity following the Separation.\nThere is the possibility that certain liabilities of Trinity could become Arcosa\u2019s obligations. For example, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Trinity U.S. consolidated group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire Trinity U.S. consolidated group for that taxable period. Consequently, if Trinity is unable to pay the consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability for a prior period, Arcosa could be required to pay the entire amount of such tax which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to it under the tax matters agreement between it and Trinity. Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities.\nIn connection with Arcosa\u2019s Separation from Trinity, Trinity has agreed to indemnify Arcosa for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure Arcosa against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Trinity\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, Trinity has agreed to indemnify Arcosa for certain pre-Separation liabilities. However, third parties could also seek to hold Arcosa responsible for liabilities that Trinity has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Trinity will be sufficient to protect Arcosa against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Trinity will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. In addition, Trinity\u2019s insurers may attempt to deny coverage to Arcosa for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the Separation.\nIf the distribution of shares of Arcosa, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Arcosa's stockholders in the distribution and Trinity could be subject to significant tax liability and, in certain circumstances, Arcosa could be required to indemnify Trinity for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nIn connection with the distribution of shares of Arcosa, Trinity received (i) a private letter ruling from the IRS and (ii) an opinion of each of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, tax counsel to Trinity, and KPMG, tax advisor to Trinity, substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The IRS ruling and the tax opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from Trinity and Arcosa, including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters, and the tax opinions rely on the IRS ruling. Notwithstanding the IRS ruling and the tax opinions, the IRS could determine that the distribution or any such related transaction is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinions that are not covered by the IRS ruling.\nIf the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a stockholder of Trinity that has received shares of Arcosa common stock in the distribution would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair value of such Arcosa shares on the distribution date and could incur significant income tax liabilities. Such\ndistribution would be taxable to such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of Trinity\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits, including Trinity\u2019s taxable gain, if any, on the distribution. Any amount that exceeded Trinity\u2019s earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of Trinity stock, with any remaining amount being taxed as capital gain. Trinity would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares of Arcosa common stock held by Trinity on the distribution date over Trinity\u2019s tax basis in such shares.\nUnder the tax matters agreement between Trinity and Arcosa, Arcosa may be required to indemnify Trinity against any taxes imposed on Trinity that arise from the failure of the distribution to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to Arcosa\u2019s stock, assets or business or any breach of Arcosa\u2019s representations, covenants or obligations under the tax matters agreement (or any other agreement Arcosa enters into in connection with the separation and distribution), the materials submitted to the IRS in connection with the request for the IRS ruling or the representation letters provided by Arcosa in connection with the tax opinions. Events triggering an indemnification obligation under the tax matters agreement include events occurring after the distribution that cause Trinity to recognize a gain under Section 355(e) of the Code. Such tax amounts could be significant, and Arcosa\u2019s obligations under the tax matters agreement will not be limited by amount or subject to any cap. If Arcosa is required to indemnify Trinity under the circumstances set forth above or otherwise under the tax matters agreement, Arcosa may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect its financial position.\nArcosa may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions after the Separation.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to Trinity and its stockholders of the distribution and certain related transactions, under the tax matters agreement between Arcosa and Trinity, Arcosa will be restricted from taking any action following the distribution that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the tax matters agreement, for the two-year period following the distribution, Arcosa will be prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from:\n\u2022\nentering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of 40 percent or more of its stock or substantially all of its assets, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u2022\nmerging, consolidating, or liquidating;\n\u2022\nissuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u2022\nrepurchasing its capital stock unless certain conditions are met; and\n\u2022\nceasing to actively conduct its business.\nThese restrictions may limit Arcosa\u2019s ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that it may believe to be in the best interests of its stockholders or that might increase the value of its business. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, Arcosa will be required to indemnify Trinity against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of Arcosa\u2019s stock or assets, even if Arcosa did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition.\nThe Separation and related internal restructuring transactions may expose Arcosa to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nThe Separation could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including, without limitation, a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by Trinity or Arcosa or any of their respective subsidiaries) may bring a lawsuit alleging that the Separation or any of the related transactions constituted a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including, without limitation, voiding the distribution and returning Arcosa\u2019s assets or Arcosa\u2019s shares and subject Trinity and/or Arcosa to liability.\nThe distribution of Arcosa common stock is also subject to state corporate distribution statutes. Under Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (i) out of its surplus (net assets minus capital) or (ii) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Although Trinity made the distribution of Arcosa common stock entirely out of surplus, Arcosa or Trinity cannot ensure that a court would reach the same conclusion in determining the availability of surplus for the separation and the distribution to Trinity\u2019s stockholders.\nCertain of Arcosa\u2019s executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous positions at Trinity.\nBecause of their former positions with Trinity, certain of Arcosa\u2019s executive officers and directors own equity interests in Trinity. Although Arcosa\u2019s Board of Directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, and Arcosa\u2019s executive officers who were former employees of Trinity ceased to be employees of Trinity upon the Separation, some of Arcosa\u2019s executive officers\nand directors will continue to have a financial interest in shares of Trinity common stock. Continuing ownership of shares of Trinity common stock and equity awards could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if Arcosa and Trinity pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for Trinity and Arcosa.\nArcosa may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms it receives in its agreements with Trinity.\nThe agreements Arcosa entered into with Trinity in connection with the Separation, including the separation and distribution agreement, transition services agreement, tax matters agreement, intellectual property matters agreement, and employee matters agreement, were prepared in the context of Arcosa\u2019s Separation from Trinity while Arcosa was still a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trinity. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were prepared, Arcosa did not have a board of directors or management team that was independent of Trinity. While the parties believe the terms reflect arm\u2019s-length terms, there can be no assurance that Arcosa would not have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms it receives in its agreements with Trinity.\nRisks Related to Arcosa Common Stock.\nArcosa\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which shares of Arcosa common stock may trade. The trading and market price of Arcosa common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond Arcosa\u2019s control, including:\n\u2022\nArcosa\u2019s quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in Arcosa\u2019s operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or Arcosa\u2019s ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nArcosa\u2019s ability to meet its forward looking guidance;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations and domestic and worldwide economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of Arcosa\u2019s common stock, regardless of Arcosa\u2019s operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholder derivative lawsuits and/or securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn addition, investors may have difficulty accurately valuing Arcosa common stock. Investors often value companies based on the stock prices and results of operations of other comparable companies. Investors may find it difficult to find comparable companies and to accurately value Arcosa common stock, which may cause the trading price of Arcosa common stock to fluctuate.\nFuture sales by us or our existing stockholders may cause our stock price to decline.\nAny transfer or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such transfer or sales might occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, particularly when our trading volumes are low. As of January 15, 2020, we had a total of 48.3 million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Shares are generally freely tradeable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for shares owned by one of our \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. Shares held by \u201caffiliates\u201d may be sold in the public market if registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144. The sales of significant amounts of shares of our common stock or the perception in the market that this could occur may result in the lowering of the market price of our common stock.\nArcosa cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock.\nThe timing, declaration, amount, and payment of future dividends to Arcosa\u2019s stockholders falls within the discretion of Arcosa\u2019s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors\u2019 decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, such as Arcosa\u2019s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants related to our debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. Arcosa\u2019s ability to pay future dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets. Arcosa cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay any dividend in the future.\nYour percentage of ownership in Arcosa may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in Arcosa may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions, or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that Arcosa grants to its directors, officers, and employees.\nIn addition, Arcosa\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation authorizes Arcosa to issue, without the approval of Arcosa\u2019s stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, and other special rights, including preferences over Arcosa common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as Arcosa\u2019s Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred\nstock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Arcosa common stock. For example, Arcosa could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of Arcosa\u2019s directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences Arcosa could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of Arcosa common stock.\nCertain provisions in Arcosa\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of Arcosa, which could decrease the trading price of the common stock.\nArcosa\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Arcosa\u2019s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of Arcosa\u2019s Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe ability of Arcosa\u2019s directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies (including those resulting from an enlargement of the Board of Directors) on Arcosa\u2019s Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthe initial division of Arcosa\u2019s Board of Directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered term; and\n\u2022\na provision that directors serving on a classified board may be removed by stockholders only for cause.\nIn addition, Arcosa is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that (without prior board approval) acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliate becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nArcosa believes these provisions will protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with Arcosa\u2019s Board of Directors and by providing Arcosa\u2019s Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make Arcosa immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Arcosa\u2019s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Arcosa and its stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of Arcosa\u2019s stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the tax matters agreement, Arcosa would be required to indemnify Trinity for the tax imposed under Section 355(e) of the Code resulting from an acquisition or issuance of Arcosa stock, even if Arcosa did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable.\nArcosa's restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain exclusive forum provisions that could limit an Arcosa stockholder\u2019s ability to choose a judicial forum that it finds favorable for certain disputes with Arcosa or its directors, officers, stockholders, employees, or agents, and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nArcosa\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that unless the Board of Directors otherwise determines, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Arcosa, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, stockholder, employee, or agent of Arcosa to Arcosa or Arcosa\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against Arcosa or any director, officer, stockholder, employee, or agent of Arcosa arising out of or relating to any provision of the DGCL or Arcosa\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against Arcosa or any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of Arcosa governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases subject to the court having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for such disputes and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, Arcosa may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 18144, "SIC": 3440, "TIC": "ACA"}
