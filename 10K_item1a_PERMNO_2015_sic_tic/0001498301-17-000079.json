{"cik": "1498301", "company": "Ascena Retail Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-09-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are risks associated with an investment in our securities. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our prospects, our operational results, our financial condition, our liquidity, the trading prices of our securities, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. Our operational results, financial position and cash flows could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to those described below. Many of these factors are outside of our control, currently believed to be immaterial and/or not presently known to us. If we are not successful in managing these risks, they could have a negative impact our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors negatively impacting consumer spending include volatility in national and international financial markets, consumer confidence, fiscal and monetary policies of government, high unemployment, lower wage levels, increased taxation, credit availability, high consumer debt, reductions in net worth, higher fuel, energy and other prices, tax policies, increasing interest rates, severe weather conditions, the threat of or actual terrorist attacks, military conflicts, the domestic or international political environment, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Lastly, consumer spending habits continue to shift on an accelerated pace towards an increasing preference to purchase merchandise digitally as opposed to in traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores. Such macroeconomic and other factors could have a negative effect on consumer spending in the U.S., which in turn could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial condition and cash flows\nExisting and increased competition and fundamental shifts in the women\u2019s and girls' retail apparel industry may reduce our net revenues, operational results and market share.\nThe women\u2019s and girls\u2019 retail apparel industry is highly competitive. Although the Company is one of the nation\u2019s largest specialty retailers, we have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local level, primarily consisting of department stores, off-price retailers, other specialty stores, discount stores, mass merchandisers, Internet and mail-order retailers, some of whom have advantages over us, including substantially greater financial, marketing or promotional resources. Many retailers, such as department stores, also offer a broader selection of merchandise than we offer, continue to be promotional by reducing their selling prices, and in some cases are expanding into markets in which we have a significant presence.\nIn addition, the growth and prominence of fast-fashion and value-fashion retailers and expansion of off-price retailers have fundamentally shifted customers\u2019 expectations of affordable pricing of well-known brands and continued promotional pressure. The rise of these retailers as well as the shift in shopping preferences from brick-and-mortar stores to the ecommerce channel, where online-only businesses or those with robust ecommerce capabilities continue to grow, have increased the difficulty of maintaining and gaining market share. Such competition, pricing pressures, shopping preferences and loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our stock has fluctuated substantially and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Future announcements or disclosures concerning us or any of our competitors, our strategic initiatives, our sales and profitability, our financial condition, any quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results or comparable sales, any failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations and sales of large blocks of our stock, among other factors, could cause the market price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. This volatility could affect the price at which shares of our stock could be sold.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of the company\u2019s securities. Such litigation could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous international jurisdictions. In addition, our merchandise is subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in certain jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and reserves are re-evaluated. In addition, our effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or losses by taxing jurisdictions or by changes to existing accounting rules, regulations or interpretations thereof.\nOperational Risks\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict fashion trends and customer preferences in a timely manner.\nFashion apparel trends and customer preferences are volatile and tend to change rapidly, particularly for women and tween girls. Our success depends largely on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify and respond to changing fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of the merchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business and our image with our customers. Because we enter into agreements for the manufacture and purchase of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and demand, price shifting, and the optimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. If we miscalculate either the demand for our merchandise or our customers\u2019 tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below average markups over cost, or below cost, which would have an adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from the Change for Growth program.\nWe have implemented, and plan to continue to implement the Change for Growth program, as described in Item 1 - Business. The Change for Growth program is designed to deliver long-term sustainable growth by enhancing our operating effectiveness and efficiency, rightsizing and increasing the quality of our distribution channels, and reducing our operating costs. The Change for Growth program presents significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including:\n\u2022\nhigher than anticipated costs in implementing planned workforce reductions;\n\u2022\nhigher than anticipated lease termination and store closure costs related to the Fleet Optimization, which is discussed below;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet operational targets or customer requirements due to the loss of employees or inadequate transfer of knowledge;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing, and subsequent to, completing the Change for Growth program;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale;\n\u2022\nattrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation and brand image due to our restructuring-related activities, including certain store closures.\nIf we are not successful in implementing and managing the Change for Growth program, we may not be able to achieve targeted operating enhancements and/or cost reductions within the expected time frame, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to achieve targeted operating enhancements and/or cost reductions could also result in the implementation of additional restructuring-related activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term.\nWe may not fully realize the benefits from the Fleet Optimization initiative as part of the Change for Growth program.\nIn Fiscal 2017, as part of its Change for Growth program, the Company completed the Fleet Optimization review. This review had the goal of reducing the number of marginally profitable stores, through rent reductions or store closures, in an effort to increase the overall profitability of the remaining store footprint. The estimated costs and benefits associated with this initiative may vary\nmaterially based on various factors including: timing in execution, outcome of negotiations with landlords, and changes in management\u2019s assumptions and projections. As a result of these events and circumstances, delays and unexpected costs may occur, which could result in our not realizing all, or any portion, of the anticipated benefits of the Fleet Optimization initiative.\nOur ability to successfully implement and optimize our omni-channel retail strategy and maintain a relevant and reliable omni-channel experience for our customers.\nWe are committed to growing our business through our omni-channel retail strategy. Our goal is to offer our customer seamless access to our brands and merchandise whenever and wherever they choose to shop. Accordingly, our success also depends on our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing strategies to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple portals, including mobile technologies, to meet their shopping needs. Failure to enhance our technology and marketing efforts to align with our customers\u2019 shopping preferences could significantly impair our ability to meet our strategic business and financial goals. Failing to successfully implement and optimize our omni-channel retail strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nAs we transition certain functions to an external managed service provider, we will become more dependent on the third party performing these functions.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services. In some cases, this requires that we work with third parties to provide services and/or functions that can be provided more effectively by external third party providers, as more fully described in Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties, the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business. Any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers, over which we have no control, could also have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and cost-effective basis on terms favorable to us.\nOur international service providers and our own international operations subject us to additional risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and may impair our ability to operate effectively.\nRecently, we engaged in efforts to reduce our costs by utilizing lower-cost labor outside the U.S. through outsourcing arrangements. It is likely that the countries where our outsourcing vendors are located may be subject to higher degrees of political and/or social instability than the U.S. and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. Such disruptions could impact our ability to deliver our products and services on a timely basis, if at all, and to a lesser extent could decrease efficiency and increase our costs. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currencies used and higher inflation rates experienced in these countries may also reduce the savings we planned to achieve. Furthermore, the practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries has come under increased scrutiny in the U.S., which ultimately could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, the U.S. or the foreign countries in which we have service provider arrangements or operate could adopt new legislation or regulations that would adversely affect our business by making it difficult, more costly or impossible for us to continue our foreign activities as currently being conducted. Furthermore, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"). Any violations of FCPA or local anti-corruption laws by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation and result in substantial financial penalties or other sanctions.\nOur ability to maintain our brand image, engage new and existing customers and gain market share.\nOur ability to maintain our brand image and reputation is integral to our business as well as the implementation of strategies to expand it. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend largely on the success of our design, merchandising and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. In addition, our success depends, in part, on our ability to keep existing customers, while engaging and attracting new customers to shop our brands. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives for any of our brands and failure to achieve consistent, positive performance at several of our brands simultaneously could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. In addition, our ability to address the challenges of declining store traffic at our brick-and-mortar stores, in a highly promotional, low growth environment may impact our ability to maintain and gain market share and also impact our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business depends on effective marketing, advertising and promotional programs.\nCustomer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising, marketing and promotional activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands, and the location and service offered in our stores. Although we use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including social media, database marketing and print, our competitors may spend more or use different approaches, which could provide them with a competitive advantage. Our promotional activity and other programs may not be effective, may be perceived negatively or could require increased expenditures, which could adversely impact our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe depend on key personnel in order to support our existing business and future initiatives and may not be able to retain or replace these employees, recruit additional qualified personnel or effectively manage succession.\nWe believe that we have benefited substantially from our leadership and the experience of our senior executives. The loss of the services of our senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and projects, as we may not be able to find suitable management personnel to replace departing executives on a timely basis. In addition, as our business develops, we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. Competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.\nWe rely on foreign sources of production.\nWe purchase a significant portion of our merchandise directly from foreign markets. Our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult for goods sourced outside the United States. We face a variety of risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nfinancial or political instability or terrorist acts in any of the countries in which our merchandise is manufactured, or the channels through which it passes;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies or restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries;\n\u2022\ninability of our manufacturers to comply with local laws, including labor laws, health and safety laws or labor practices;\n\u2022\nincreased security and regulatory requirements and inspections applicable to imported goods;\n\u2022\nimposition or increases of duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports;\n\u2022\nimposition of new legislation relating to import quotas or other restrictions that may limit the quantity of our merchandise that may be imported into the United States from countries in regions where we do business;\n\u2022\nimpact of natural disasters, extreme weather, public health concerns or other catastrophes on our foreign sourcing offices and vendor manufacturing operations;\n\u2022\ndelays in shipping due to port security or congestion issues, labor disputes or shortages, local business practices, vendor compliance with applicable import regulations or weather conditions;\n\u2022\nviolations under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\nincreased costs of transportation.\nNew legislative initiatives may be proposed that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that, if enacted, could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries or restrict the importation of products from such countries. The future performance of our business depends on foreign suppliers, and may be adversely affected by the factors listed above, all of which are beyond our control. The foregoing may result in our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise or increase our costs.\nWe require our independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our internal requirements. Our vendor code of conduct, guidelines and other compliance programs promote ethical business practices, and we monitor compliance with them; however, we do not control these manufacturers, their labor practices, the health and safety conditions of their facilities, or their sources of raw materials, and from time to time these manufactures may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable laws. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more manufacturer could have a negative impact on our reputation and our business.\nAny of the aforementioned risks, independently or in combination with others, could have an adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer as a result of a third-party manufacturer\u2019s inability to produce goods for us on time and to our specifications.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third-parties for the manufacture of all of the goods that we sell. Both domestic and international manufacturers produce these goods. The Company is at risk for increases in manufacturing costs, and we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with these third-party manufacturers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with merchandise specifications, insufficient quality control and failure to meet production deadlines. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of world-wide events, including inclement weather, natural or man-made disasters, public health issues, strikes, acts of terror or political, social or economic conditions on our major suppliers. Our suppliers could also face economic pressures as a result of rising wages and inflation or experience difficulty obtaining adequate credit or access to liquidity to finance their operations, which could lead to vendor consolidation. A manufacturer's failure to continue to work with us, ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards could result in supply shortages, failure to meet customer expectations and damage to our brands, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer a material adverse effect if our distribution or fulfillment centers were shut down or disrupted.\nNearly all of the merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution and fulfillment centers, where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores or to the customer directly through our ecommerce channel. We depend in large part on the orderly operation of our receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules, proper functioning of our information technology and inventory control systems and overall effective management of our distribution and fulfillment centers. As a result of damage to, or prolonged interruption of, operations at any of these facilities due to a work stoppage, supply chain disruption, inclement weather, natural or man-made disasters, system failures, slowdowns or strikes, acts of terror or other unforeseen events, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores or customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operational results and cash flows.\nAlthough we maintain business interruption and property insurance for these facilities, management cannot be assured that our insurance coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us, if our distribution or fulfillment centers are shut down or interrupted for any unplanned reason.\nOur business could suffer as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, labor, energy, freight and trade relations.\nRaw materials used to manufacture our merchandise are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high or low demand for fabrics, labor conditions, transportation or freight costs, currency fluctuations, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, economic inflation, market speculation and other unpredictable factors. Increases in the demand for and price of cotton, wool and other raw materials used in the production of fabric and accessories, as well as increases in labor and energy costs or shortages of skilled labor, could result in increases for the costs of our products as well as their distribution to our distribution centers, retail locations and to our customers. The Company is also susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of transportation. Additionally, greater uncertainty with respect to trade relations, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could result in higher product costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer as a result of disruptions at ports used to import our products.\nWe currently ship the vast majority of our products by ocean. If a disruption occurs in the operation of ports through which our products are imported, we and our vendors may have to ship some or all of our products from Asia or other regions by air freight or to alternate shipping destinations in the United States. Shipping by air is significantly more expensive than shipping by ocean and our profitability could be reduced. Similarly, shipping to alternate destinations in the United States could lead to increased lead times and costs for our products. A disruption at ports (domestic or abroad) through which our products are imported could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nRisks associated with ecommerce sales.\nThe successful operation of our ecommerce business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and continuous operation of our ecommerce websites and our associated fulfillment operations, and to provide a shopping experience that will generate orders and return visits to our sites. Our ecommerce services are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ncomputer system failures, including but not limited to, inadequate system capacity, human error, change in programming, website downtimes, system upgrades or migrations, Internet service or power outages;\n\u2022\ncyber incidents, including but not limited to, security breaches and computer viruses;\n\u2022\nreliance on third-party computer hardware/software fulfillment and delivery providers;\n\u2022\nunfavorable federal or state regulations or laws;\n\u2022\nviolations of federal, state or other applicable laws, including those related to online privacy;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in telecommunication systems, power outages or other technical failures;\n\u2022\ncredit card fraud;\n\u2022\nconstantly evolving technology;\n\u2022\nliability for online content; and\n\u2022\nnatural or man-made disasters or adverse weather conditions.\nThe Company's failure to successfully address and respond to any one or more of these risks could damage the reputation of our brands and have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer if our information technology systems fail to operate effectively, are disrupted or compromised.\nWe rely on our existing information technology systems in operating, supporting and monitoring all major aspects of our business, including sales, warehousing, fulfillment, distribution, purchasing, inventory control, merchandise planning and replenishment, and financial systems. We regularly evaluate and make investments to upgrade, enhance or replace these systems, as well as leverage new technologies to support our growth strategies. We are aware of inherent risks associated with operating, replacing and modifying these systems, including inaccurate system information and system disruptions. We believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, staging implementation and in-sourcing certain processes, as well as securing appropriate commercial contracts with third-party vendors supplying such replacement and redundancy technologies; however, there is a risk that information technology system disruptions and inaccurate system information, if not anticipated and/or appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nThe reliability and capacity of our information technology systems (including third-party hardware and software systems or services) are critical to our continued operations. Despite our precautionary efforts, our information technology systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, natural or man-made disasters, technical malfunctions, inadequate systems capacity, power outages, computer viruses and security breaches, which may require significant investment to fix or replace, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays to our operations.\nWhile we believe that we are diligent in selecting vendors, systems and services to assist us in maintaining the integrity of our information technology systems, we realize that there are risks and that no guarantee can be made that future disruptions, service outages/failures or unauthorized intrusions will not occur. Certain of our information technology support functions are performed by third-parties in overseas locations. Failure by any of these third-parties to implement and/or manage our information systems and infrastructure effectively and securely could impact our operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increased expenses to mitigate our exposure.\nOur business and that of our third-party service providers employ systems and websites that allow us to process credit card transactions containing personally identifiable information (\"PII\"), perform online ecommerce and social media activities, and store and transmit proprietary or confidential customer, employee, job applicant and other personal confidential information. Security and/or privacy breaches, acts of vandalism or terror, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming, and/or human error or other similar events could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks or intrusions. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur significant and additional costs, including, but not limited to the costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, engaging third-party experts and consultants and compliance costs associated with various applicable laws or industry standards regarding use and/or unauthorized disclosure of PII. We may also incur significant remediation costs, including liability for stolen customer, job applicant or employee information, repairing system damage or providing credit monitoring or other benefits to affected customers, job applicants or employees. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data from being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by our third-party service providers that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. We have recently identified signs of unauthorized access to a web application server and engaged a third-party cyber-security firm to determine the nature and extent of such access. This investigation remains ongoing. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the costs, or a range of costs, related to this incident. Although we maintain cyber-security insurance there can be no assur\nance that our insurance coverage will cover the particular cyber incident at issue or that such coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be paid to us in a timely manner.\nThe protection of customer, employee and Company data is critical. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. In addition, customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. Any actual or perceived misappropriation or breach involving this data could attract negative media attention, cause harm to our reputation or result in liability (including but not limited to fines, penalties or lawsuits), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with customer payment methods, including credit card fraud and identity theft, which would cause us to incur unexpected expenses and loss of revenues.\nIn the standard course of business, we process customer information, including payment information, through our stores and ecommerce sites. There is an increased concern over the security of PII transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. We endeavor to protect consumer identity and payment information through the implementation of security technologies, processes and procedures. It is possible that an individual or group could defeat our security measures and access sensitive consumer information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increased costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Incidents which result in exposure of customer data will be handled in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Exposure of customer data through any means could materially harm the Company by, but not limited to, reputational damage, regulatory fines and costs of litigation.\nOn October 1, 2015 the payment cards industry began shifting liability for certain debit and credit card transactions to retailers who do not accept Europay, MasterCard and Visa (\u201cEMV\u201d) chip technology transactions. All ascena brands have implemented EMV chip technology in its stores and are in the final process of certification. Until we have final verification on certification, we may be liable for chargebacks related to counterfeit transactions generated through EMV chip enabled cards, which could negatively impact our operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur ability to successfully integrate new acquisitions.\nThe success of our businesses depends on our ability to integrate and manage our expanding operations, to realize opportunities for revenue growth and to eliminate redundant and excess costs. Achieving the anticipated benefits of previous and future acquisitions, including the ANN Acquisition, may present a number of significant risks and considerations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nunsuccessful, delayed or more costly integration;\n\u2022\ndemands on management related to the increase in our size and the loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;\n\u2022\nexpected cost savings not being achieved in full, or taking longer or requiring greater investment to achieve; and\n\u2022\nnot achieving the anticipated omni-channel growth potential.\nImpairment to the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could result in significant non-cash charges.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. As described in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2017, we recorded impairment charges of $596.3 million related to goodwill and $728.1 million related to other intangible assets. As of July 29, 2017, we had approximately $1.2 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisitions of maurices in January 2005, Justice in November 2009, Lane Bryant and Catherines in June 2012 and ANN in August 2015. Current and future economic conditions, as well as the other risks noted in this Item 1A, may adversely impact our brands' ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers, maintain sales volumes and maintain margins. As discussed in our Critical Accounting Policies included elsewhere herein, these events could materially reduce our brands' profitability and cash flow which could, in turn, lead to a further impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, significant negative industry or general economic trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets may result in additional impairments to our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Any impairment could have a material effect on our operational results and financial condition.\nOur gross margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to manage our inventory effectively.\nOur profitability depends upon our ability to manage appropriate inventory levels and respond quickly to shifts in consumer demand patterns. We must properly execute our inventory management strategies by appropriately allocating merchandise among our stores and online, timely and efficiently distributing inventory to stores, maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory in stores and online, adjusting our merchandise mix between our brands, appropriately changing the allocation of our product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively managing pricing and markdowns. If we overestimate customer demand for our merchandise, we may need to sell the excess inventory at lower prices which would negatively impact our gross margins and could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial condition and cash flows. If we underestimate customer demand for our merchandise, we may experience inventory shortages which may result in missed sales opportunities that could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.\nWe intend to expand our operations and presence in existing and new countries in the future. Several of our brands have expanded their presence into Canada as well as certain countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Central America and South America, either through their own retail operations or through franchise or other licensing operations.\nAs we expand internationally, we may incur significant costs associated with the start-up and maintenance of foreign operations. Costs may include, but are not limited to, obtaining locations for stores, setting up foreign offices, hiring experienced management and maintaining good relations with associates. We may be unable to open and operate new stores successfully, or we may face operational issues that delay our intended pace of international store growth. In many of these new locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our merchandise may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, could adversely affect our ability to achieve the objectives that we have established.\nIn addition, franchised stores are independently owned and operated, and franchisees are not our employees. Consequently, franchisees may not operate in accordance with our standards or requirements or in a manner consistent with applicable law. The quality of franchised operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. The failure of our franchisees to operate franchises successfully could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operational results, financial position and cash flow.\nOther challenges associated with international expansion may include diverting financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing operations and/or result in increased costs, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Failure to implement our international expansion plan consistent with our internal expectations, whether as a result of one or more of the factors listed above or other factors, could adversely affect our ability to achieve the objectives that we have established.\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, we are subject to certain U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as compliance with the laws of foreign countries in which we operate. Violations of these laws could subject us to sanctions or other fines or penalties that would have an adverse effect on our reputation, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our trademarks and service marks are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and service marks on a worldwide basis, including in the countries in which we have business operations or plan to have business operations. Because we have not registered all of our trademarks in all categories, or in all foreign countries in which we currently, or may in the future, source or offer our merchandise, our international expansion and our merchandising of products using these marks could be negatively impacted. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or material challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks in the United States or Canada. Nevertheless, the actions we have taken, including to establish and protect our trademarks and service marks, may not be adequate to prevent others from imitating our products or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products. Also, others may assert proprietary rights in our intellectual property and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Any litigation regarding our trademarks could\nbe time-consuming and costly. The loss of exclusive use of our trademarks could have a material adverse effect on our operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may suffer negative publicity and our business may be harmed if we need to recall any product we sell or if we fail to comply with applicable product safety laws.\nThe products our brands sell are regulated by many different governmental bodies, including but not limited to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S., Health Canada in Canada, and similar state, provincial and international regulatory authorities. Although we generally test the products sold in our brands\u2019 stores and on our brands\u2019 websites, selected products still could present safety problems of which our brands are not aware. This could lead one or more of our brands to recall selected products, either voluntarily or at the direction of a governmental authority, and may lead to a lack of consumer acceptance or loss of consumer trust. Product safety concerns, recalls, defects or errors could result in the rejection of our products by customers, damage to our reputation, lost sales, product liability litigation and increased costs, any or all of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operational results and cash flows.\nThe cost of compliance with current requirements and any future requirements of federal, state or international regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operational results and cash flows. Examples of these requirements include regulatory testing, certification, packaging, labeling, advertising and reporting requirements affecting broad categories of consumer products. In addition, any failure of one or more of our brands to comply with such requirements could result in significant penalties, require one or more of our brands to recall products and harm our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe depend on strip shopping center and mall traffic and our ability to identify suitable store locations.\nMany of our stores are located in strip shopping centers, shopping malls and other retail centers that, historically, have benefited from their proximity to \u201canchor\u201d retail tenants, generally large department stores, and other attractions, which generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Strip shopping center and mall traffic may be adversely affected by, among other things, economic downturns, the closing of, or continued decline of, anchor stores that drive consumer traffic or changes in customer shopping preferences. A decline in the popularity of strip shopping center or mall shopping among our target customers could have a material adverse effect on customer traffic and our operational results. In order to leverage customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers, we need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable consumer locations, however competition for such suitable store locations is intense.\nIn addition, continued consolidation in the commercial retail real estate market could affect our ability to successfully negotiate favorable rental terms for our stores in the future. Should significant consolidation continue, a large portion of our store base could be concentrated with one or fewer landlords that could then be in a position to dictate unfavorable terms to us due to their significant negotiating leverage. If we are unable to negotiate favorable lease terms with these landlords, this could affect our ability to profitably operate our stores, which in turn could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial condition and cash flows.\nActs of terrorism, effects of war, public health, man-made and natural disasters, other catastrophes or political unrest could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe threat, or actual acts, of terrorism continue to be a significant risk to the global economy. Terrorism and potential military responses, political unrest, natural disasters, pandemics and other health issues have disrupted or could in the future disrupt commerce, impact our ability to operate our stores, offices or distribution and fulfillment centers in the affected areas or impact our ability to provide critical functions or services necessary to the operation of our business. A disruption of commerce, or an inability to recover critical functions or services from such a disruption, could interfere with the production, shipment or receipt of our merchandise in a timely manner or increase our costs to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows. In addition, any of the above disruptions could undermine consumer confidence, which could negatively impact consumer spending or customer traffic, and thus have an adverse effect on our operational results.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse impact of any of the above disruptions also depends, in part, upon the effectiveness of our disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning. However, we cannot be certain that our plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an actual disaster or other catastrophic situation. In addition, although we maintain insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us.\nOur business could suffer a material adverse effect from extreme or unseasonable weather conditions.\nExtreme weather conditions in the areas in which the Company's stores are located could negatively affect the Company's business, operational results, financial position and cash flows. Frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over an extended period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores, and may cause a disruption in the shipment or receipt of our merchandise, which could negatively impact the Company's operational results. The Company's business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions, which could influence customer trends, consumer traffic and shopping habits. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool temperatures during the summer season could reduce demand and thereby would have an adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nCapital Risks\nWe incurred significant additional indebtedness in connection with the ANN Acquisition, which could adversely affect us.\nWe substantially increased our indebtedness in connection with the completion of the ANN Acquisition, which could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and further increasing our interest expense. We also incurred various costs and expenses associated with our financings. The amount of cash flows required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels resulting from the ANN Acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources, will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the transaction. The increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the acquisition, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nThe indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition bears interest at variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nIn addition, our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating organization\u2019s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. In connection with the debt financing, we received ratings from S&P and Moody\u2019s. There can be no assurance that we will maintain particular ratings in the future.\nMoreover, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions or for other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nTo service our indebtedness after the ANN Acquisition, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make cash payments on our indebtedness as a result of the ANN Acquisition, as well as our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operating or strategic initiatives will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future, which is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that will be beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs. In any such circumstance, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity, or incur additional debt subject to the restrictions of our borrowing agreements. We may not be able to refinance any indebtedness or incur additional debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness or incur additional debt, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Any such action, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The instruments governing our indebtedness may restrict our ability to sell assets and our use of the proceeds from such sales.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and the lenders under the term facility, the revolving facility and other indebtedness, or any replacement facilities in respect thereof, could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making\nfurther loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against the Company\u2019s assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur Amended Revolving Credit Agreement and our Term Loan contain various covenants that impose restrictions on the Company and certain of its subsidiaries that may affect their ability to operate their businesses.\nThe Amended Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Loan contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on their property, change the nature of their business, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of their assets to any one person. In addition, the agreements that govern the financings contain financial covenants that, under certain circumstances, will require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios. The ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by our operating results as well as events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the Company\u2019s repayment obligations.\nInability to access liquidity or capital markets could adversely affect the Company's business, operational results, financial position or cash flows.\nChanges in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict the Company\u2019s access to potential sources of future liquidity. As a result of general unpredictability in the global financial markets, there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. Although we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operations, and our availability under our $600 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future, any renewed tightening of the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, enter into an agreement for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities. Our borrowing agreements also have financial convents and certain restrictions which, if not met, may limit our ability to access funds.\nIn addition, we also have cash and cash equivalents on deposit at overseas financial institutions as well as at FDIC-insured financial institutions that are currently in excess of FDIC-insured limits. As a result, we cannot be assured that we can access the cash and cash equivalents overseas when we are in need of liquidity, or that we will not experience losses with respect to cash on deposit at these financial institutions.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur business may be affected by regulatory, administrative and litigation developments.\nLaws and regulations at the local, state, federal and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be reasonably estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from regulatory or administrative changes. Changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, advertising and marketing practices, product safety, transportation and logistics, healthcare, tax, accounting, privacy, operations or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements and our procedures and internal controls are designed to promote such compliance, we cannot assure that all of our operations will at all times comply with all such legal and regulatory requirements. A finding that we or our vendors or agents are out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies or criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and stock price. In addition, even the claim of a violation of applicable laws or regulations could negatively affect our reputation. We are also involved from time to time in litigation arising primarily in the ordinary course of business. Litigation matters may include, among other things, employment, commercial, intellectual property, advertising or shareholder claims, and any adverse decision in any such litigation could adversely impact our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nIncreases in labor costs related to changes in employment laws or regulations could impact our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nVarious foreign and domestic labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect our operating costs. These include minimum wage requirements, overtime and sick pay, paid time off, work scheduling, healthcare reform and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, and union organizations. A number of factors could adversely affect our operating costs, including additional government-imposed increases in minimum wages, overtime\nand sick pay, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits, and changing regulations from the National Labor Relations Board or other agencies. Additionally, recent political changes could lead to the repeal of, or changes to, some or all of the ACA. Complying with any new legislation and/or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive and could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information.\nWe must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We cannot be assured that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will prove to be adequate in the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting or to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nChanges to accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regards to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to revenue recognition, leases, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, inventory, income taxes and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change or increase volatility of our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. See Note 4, \u201cRecently Issued Accounting Standards,\u201d in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies,\u201d included herein which discusses accounting policies considered to be important to our operational results and financial condition. These and other future changes to accounting rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 30737, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "ASNAQ"}
