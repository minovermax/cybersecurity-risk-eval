{"cik": "1610853", "company": "HELIUS MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this annual report on Form 10-K in evaluating our company and its business before purchasing shares of our common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following risks. The risks described below may not be all of the risks facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe have a very limited operating history.\nHelius Medical Technologies, Inc. is our holding company and it has no material assets other than cash and cash equivalents and its ownership of all of the outstanding shares of NHC, which is our wholly-owned subsidiary. NHC was incorporated in Delaware on January 22, 2013 and is a development stage company that has had limited operations to date.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the ability and expertise of our CEO and a very limited number of employees and the loss of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe currently have a very small management team and almost no other employees. Our success is dependent upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion and good faith of our senior management, and in particular Mr. Phil Deschamps, our President and CEO. Currently Mr. Deschamps is joined by Misha Danilov, Project Manager, and Jonathan Sackier as our only full-time employees. We also have engaged 15 full-time equivalent persons as independent contractors, including our Chief Financial Officer. While employment agreements are customarily used as a primary method of retaining the services of key employees, these agreements cannot assure the continued services of such employees. Any loss of the services of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred substantial net losses since our inception. For our fiscal years ending March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, we incurred a net loss of $8,894,555 and $1,067,284, respectively, and used cash in operations of $6,321,285 and $348,698 , respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $18,479,689 as of March 31, 2015. We have incurred net losses since our inception. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our design, manufacturing and development, research and development activities, stock based compensation, legal, advertising, marketing and investor relations, and general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. Even if we are successful in obtaining clearance from the FDA and launching our PoNS\u2122 device into the market, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to sell and market our current product and research and develop, and seek regulatory approvals for, other potential product candidates.\nWe will be subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial and other resources, lack of revenue and the risk that we will not achieve our growth objective. If sales revenue from any of our current product or product candidates that receive marketing clearance from the FDA or other regulatory body is insufficient, if we are unable to develop and commercialize any of our product candidates, or if our product development is delayed, we may never become profitable.\nWe will require additional financing to carry out our plan of operations and if we are unable to obtain such financing, our business may fail.\nWe currently have limited working capital and liquid assets. Our cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2015 were $418,893. To date we have not generated any revenue from the sales of products or services. There are a number of conditions that we must satisfy before we will be able to generate revenue, including but not limited to successful completion the design of the PoNS\u2122 device, FDA clearance of the PoNS\u2122 device for treating balance disorder in patients with mild to moderate TBI and balance disorder associated with MS, manufacturing of a commercially-viable version of the PoNS\u2122 device and demonstration of effectiveness sufficient to generate commercial orders by customers for our product. While we are currently seeking additional funding, we do not currently have sufficient resources to accomplish any of these conditions necessary for us to generate revenue. We will therefore require substantial additional funds in order to continue to conduct the research and development and regulatory clearance and approval activities necessary to bring our product to market, to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities and to develop other product candidates. Our existing capital resources will not be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of the development and commercialization of our current product and our product candidates. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future development and commercialization of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of these product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our current and any product candidates. We may be unable to raise the additional funding to finance our business on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing as needed, we may be required to reduce the scope of our operations and pursue only those projects that can be funded through cash flows generated from its existing operations, if any.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements. We may be unable to continue to operate without the threat of liquidation for the foreseeable future.\nOur report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended March 31, 2015 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. For example, our existing capital resources will be insufficient to fund our operations through the end of the third quarter of 2015. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our consolidated financial statements, and investors will likely lose all or a part of their investment. Future reports from our independent registered public accounting firm may also contain statements expressing doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nRaising additional capital by issuing securities or through debt financings or licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our product development and commercialization goals and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently only have one product candidate, which is still in development, and we have not obtained clearance from FDA to commercially distribute the device in the United States and clearance from Health Canada to commercially distribute the device in Canada, and we may never obtain such clearances.\nWe currently are dependent on a single product which is our PoNS\u2122 device for use in the neuromodulation market. We are still developing this product, and we cannot begin marketing and selling the device in the United States and Canada until we obtain clearances from the FDA and Health Canada, respectively. We have not yet submitted applications for regulatory clearance in either the United States or Canada. The process of obtaining regulatory clearance is expensive and time-consuming and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of a product. Changes in regulatory policy, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the clearance of a product candidate or rejection of a regulatory application altogether. The FDA has substantial discretion in the de novo review and clearance processes and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for clearance and require additional pre-clinical, clinical, or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit, or prevent marketing authorization from the FDA or regulatory clearance of a product candidate. Any marketing authorization from the FDA or regulatory clearance we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-market commitments that render the product candidate not commercially viable. If our attempts to obtain marketing authorization are unsuccessful, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain and grow our business, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are able to complete development of the PoNS\u2122 device and obtain clearance of the PoNS\u2122 device for treatment of chronic balance deficit in patients with mild to moderate TBI in the United States and chronic balance deficit associated with MS in Canada, we plan to develop the PoNS\u2122 device to treat other indications, or symptoms caused by neurological disorders. We would be required to commit our own resources to fund development of any other indications and each would require separate FDA clearance. The costs of such development efforts and FDA clearances would be substantial and would likely require additional funding, and each such indication would be subject to the same foregoing risks and uncertainties for FDA clearance.\nWe are and will continue to be dependent in significant part on outside scientists and third-party research institutions for our research and development in order to be able to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe currently have a limited number of employees and resources available to perform the research and development necessary to commercialize our PoNS\u2122 device and future product candidates. We therefore rely at present and will need to continue to rely on third-party research institution collaborators for this capability.\nOur subsidiary NHC is currently party to the CRADA with the inventors, background patent owners and the Army Laboratories. Pursuant to the CRADA, the Army Laboratories agree to cooperate with NHC on research for the ongoing design and development to determine if the PoNS\u2122 device can be developed for commercial use in assisting physical therapy in the treatment of soldiers and others with military relevant neurological disorders, including but not limited to Tinnitus, post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, pain and any subsequent indications identified by the parties. Under the terms of the CRADA, we are solely responsible to fund and oversee clinical studies for the PoNS\u2122 device and seek FDA clearance and approval of the PoNS\u2122 device. We are also solely responsible to complete the research and development efforts necessary to commercialize our PoNS\u2122 device. However, the Army Laboratories has published a Notice of Intent to enter into a sole-source contractual agreement to support the execution of the registration trial for treatment of balance disorder associated with mild to moderate TBI. The objective of this contract is to defray the costs of the registration trial. The terms of the contract and the actual amount of the award are uncertain because we have not yet completed the negotiation for this contract, nor can we be assured that the Army will ever ultimately negotiate and enter into such a contract with us. The Army Laboratories also agreed in the January 12, 2015 amendment to our CRADA to be responsible to support the execution of clinical studies for the PoNS\u2122 device as a treatment for mutually agreed upon military relevant neurological disorders, which could include but not be limited to Tinnitus, PTSD, and pain and any subsequent indications identified by the parties. The amount of such support, if any, and the terms of such responsibility to support such clinical studies are not yet negotiated and we have no assurance that we can ultimately reach agreement with the Army Laboratories on such amount or terms of support, and there can be no assurance that the Army Laboratories will not otherwise attempt to renegotiate its responsibilities under the CRADA. The Army Laboratories may terminate their obligations under the CRADA at any time upon 30 days prior written notice to us. If there are insufficient funds available to cover the necessary research and development costs for our product, the Army Laboratories could terminate the CRADA and cease research and development efforts which could jeopardize our ability to commercialize our PoNS\u2122 device.\nIf we fail to obtain FDA clearance for commercialization of or otherwise fail to ensure that the PoNS\u2122 device is available for purchase by the U.S. Government by December 31, 2017, we are subject to significant risk of loss of data and proprietary rights.\nUnder the CRADA if we fail to obtain FDA clearance of the PoNS\u2122 device or otherwise fail to ensure that the PoNS\u2122 device is available for purchase by the U.S. Government, in each case by the expiration date under the CRADA of December 31, 2017, we may forfeit the right to pursue commercialization on our own. Specifically, in either such case, we will be required to (i) transfer possession, ownership and sponsorship of any regulatory application, and correspondence supporting the PoNS\u2122 technology to the USAMRMC and (ii) provide the U.S. Government with a non-exclusive, irrevocable license to any patent, copyright, data rights, proprietary information and regulatory information, in order to permit the U.S. Government to pursue commercialization on its own. Any such loss of our ability to exclusively market and sell the PoNS\u2122 device would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, given the importance of the U.S. Army to our commercial plans, if the U.S. Army were to eventually decide not to purchase our product, we would need to find other buyers for our product. If the U.S. Army were to decline to purchase our product, we may have more difficulty persuading other third parties to purchase our product.\nThere is limited market awareness of our product and the neuromodulation market is new and uncertain.\nWe believe our PoNS\u2122 product has strong potential therapeutic benefits for the neuromodulation market. The neuromodulation market is relatively new and its long-term growth prospects are uncertain. Since we do not yet have FDA clearance for our product, there is limited to no market awareness of our product. In order to succeed, we must among other things increase market awareness of our PoNS\u2122 product and implement a sales and marketing strategy. If we fail in any of these endeavors or experience delays in pursuing them, we will not generate revenues as planned and will need to curtail operations or seek additional financing earlier than otherwise anticipated. In addition, should the neuromodulation market fail to expand, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nOur PoNS\u2122 technology is a new \u201cuntested\u201d form of neurostimulation therapy and the medical community tends to be very conservative in not adopting new therapies very rapidly, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nThe effectiveness of our PoNS\u2122 technology to treat TBI or any other neurological disorder has not been established in studies conducted in a controlled environment designed to produce scientifically significant results. Accordingly, our PoNS\u2122 technology is a new \u201cuntested\u201d, and therefore unproven, therapy. Unproven and untested technologies are usually more slowly adopted by the medical community as the medical community tends to be very conservative and does not adopt new \u201cuntested\u201d therapies very rapidly. Physicians may elect not to use our products for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022 lack or perceived lack of evidence supporting the beneficial characteristics of our technology;\n\u2022 limited long-term data on the use of PoNS\u2122 technology for therapy;\n\u2022 physicians\u2019 perception that there are insufficient advantages of our product relative to currently available products;\n\u2022 hospitals may choose not to purchase our product;\n\u2022 group purchasing organizations may choose not to contract for our product, thus limiting availability of our products to hospital purchasers;\n\u2022 lack of coverage or adequate payment from managed care plans and other third-party payers for our product;\n\u2022 Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers may limit or not permit reimbursement for our product; and\n\u2022 the development of or improvement of competitive products.\nIf the medical community reacts in a similar fashion to adopting our PoNS\u2122 device for neurostimulation therapy, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, if any.\nIn order to be successful, we must expand our products beyond our single product by commercializing new product candidates, but we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion and at expected costs, or at all.\nIn order to be successful, we will need to expand our product lines beyond our PoNS\u2122 device which is currently our only product. To succeed in our commercialization efforts, we must effectively continue product development and testing, obtain regulatory clearances and approvals, and enhance our sales and marketing capabilities. There is no assurance that we will succeed in bringing any of our current or future product candidates to market. If we fail in bringing our product candidates to market, or experience delays in doing so, we will not generate revenues as planned and will need to curtail operations or seek additional financing earlier than otherwise anticipated.\nThe development of additional products is subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of new, state of the art products, laboratory devices and products based on new technologies. These risks include: (i) delays in product development or manufacturing; (ii) unplanned expenditures for product development or manufacturing; (iii) failure of new products to have the desired effect or an acceptable accuracy profile; (iv) emergence of superior or equivalent products; (v) failure by any potential collaborative partners to successfully develop products; and (vi) the dependence on third parties for the manufacture, development and sale of our products. Because of these risks, our research and development efforts or those of potential collaborative partners may not result in any commercially viable products. If a significant portion of these development efforts is not successfully completed, or any products are not commercially successful, we are less likely to generate significant revenues, or become profitable. The failure to perform such activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of its operations.\nWe can provide no assurance that the development by others of new or improved devices or products will not result in our present and future products from becoming obsolete.\nThe areas in which we plan to commercialize, distribute, and/or sell products involves rapidly developing technology. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish ourselves in such fields, or, if established, that we will be able to maintain our market position, if any. There can be no assurance that the development by others of new or improved products will not make our present and future products, if any, superfluous or obsolete.\nOur future success depends on our ability to obtain approval on the patent for the PoNS\u2122 technology, failing which we may be unable to protect our proprietary information and any competitive advantage which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain approval on the patent for the PoNS\u2122 technology. There can be no assurance that the patent application made will result in the issuance of the patent or that the term of the patent will be extendable after it expires in due course, which will prevent us from being able to protect our proprietary information and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMuch of our know-how and technology may not be patentable, though they may constitute trade secrets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. To help protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. There can be no assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure.\nOur intellectual property has been the subject of a lawsuit which has been dismissed. For a full description of this lawsuit, please see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nIf our intellectual property protection is inadequate, competitors may gain access to our technology and undermine our competitive position.\nWe regard our intended and future intellectual property as important to our success, and we intend to rely on patent law to protect our proprietary rights. Despite our precautions, unauthorized third parties may copy certain portions of our devices or products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may seek additional patents in the future. We do not know if any future patent application will be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all, or whether any patents we receive will be challenged or invalidated. Thus, we cannot assure you that any intellectual property rights that we may receive can be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Our means of protecting any proprietary rights we may receive in the United States or abroad may not be adequate and competitors may independently develop a similar technology. Any failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including intellectual property litigation, such as patent infringement claims, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe, as well as certain of our directors and officers, may be subject to claims or lawsuits. These lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses and could divert management\u2019s time and other resources. If the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us, we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices or product lines. Any of these outcomes could cause our business, financial performance and cash position to be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, our commercial success will also depend, in part, on not infringing on the patents or proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that the technologies and products used or developed by us will not infringe such rights. If such infringement occurs and we are not able to obtain a license from the relevant third party, we will not be able to continue the development, manufacture, use, or sale of any such infringing technology or product. There can be no assurance that necessary licenses to third-party technology will be available at all or on commercially reasonable term. In some cases, litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties. Any potential litigation could result in substantial costs to, and diversion of, our resources and could have a material and adverse impact on us. An adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to cease using the subject technology or require us to license the subject technology from the third party, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our expenses are greater than anticipated, then we will have fewer funds with which to pursue our plan of operations and our financing requirements will be greater than anticipated.\nWe may find that the costs of carrying out our plan of operations are greater than we anticipate. Increased operating costs may cause the amount of financing that we require to increase. Investors may be more reluctant to provide additional financing if we cannot demonstrate that we can control our operating costs. There is no assurance that additional financing required as a result of our operating costs being greater than anticipated will be available to us. If we do not control our operating expenses, then we will have fewer funds with which to carry out our plan of operations with the result that our business may fail.\nWe may not be able to build an effective distribution network for our products.\nWe currently have very few employees and will likely need to rely on third party distributors to sell our product. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in entering into and maintaining productive arrangements with an adequate number of distributors that are sufficiently committed to selling our products. The establishment of a distribution network is expensive and time consuming. As we launch new products and increase our marketing effort with respect to existing products, we will need to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled independent distributors with significant technical knowledge. In addition, the commissions we pay our distributors could increase over time which would result in higher sales and marketing expenses. Furthermore, current and potential distributors may market and sell the products of our competitors. Even if the distributors market and sell our products, our competitors may be able, by offering higher commission payments or other incentives, to persuade these distributors to reduce or terminate their sales and marketing efforts related to our products. The distributors may also help competitors solicit business from our existing customers. Some of our independent distributors will likely account for a significant portion of our sales volume, and, if we were to lose them, our sales could be adversely affected. Even if we engage and maintain suitable relationships with an adequate number of distributors, they may not generate revenue as quickly as we expect them to, commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products, or ultimately succeed in selling our products.\nWe depend on a single source for the manufacture of our product and the loss of this third-party manufacture could harm our business.\nWe will be dependent on a single third-party to manufacture and supply our PoNS\u2122 device. This manufacturer will also hold our inventory, warehouse and ship our products customers as well as handle all customer service related tasks including, order entry, order management and product warranty responsibility. Our reliance on a single third-party manufacturer to supply us with our PoNS\u2122 device and provide such other distribution and warranty services exposes us to risks that could delay our sales, or result in higher costs or lost product revenues. In particular, our manufacturer could:\n\u2022\nencounter difficulties in achieving volume production, quality control and quality assurance or suffer shortages of qualified personnel, which could result in their inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our commercially available product to meet market demand, or it could experience similar problems that result in the manufacture of insufficient quantities of our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nfail to follow and remain in compliance with the FDA-mandated QSRs, compliance which is required for all medical devices, or fail to document their compliance to QSRs, either of which could lead to significant delays in the availability of materials for our product.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of our product that meet our specifications and quality standards, it will be difficult for us to compete effectively. We have no supply agreements in place with our manufacturer and it may change the terms of our future orders or choose not to supply us with products in the future. Furthermore, if such manufacturer fails to perform its obligations, we may be forced to purchase our product from other third-party manufacturers, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms or in sufficient time, if at all. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer or the re-verification of an existing manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to produce and distribute our product in a timely manner.\nIf and when we sell our products, we may be liable for product liability claims and we may not carry sufficient product liability insurance.\nThe devices and products that we intend to develop may expose us to potential liability from personal injury claims by end-users of the product. We intend to carry product liability insurance to protect us against the risk that in the future a product liability claim or product recall could materially and adversely affect our business. Inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our intended products. We cannot assure you that if and when we commence distribution of our product that we will be able to obtain or maintain adequate coverage on acceptable terms, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims. Moreover, even if we maintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could materially and adversely affect our reputation and prospects, and divert management\u2019s time and attention. If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our future products our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. As an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation, shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and presenting the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and our financial performance. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Additionally, we have irrevocably elected to comply with new or revised accounting standards even though we are an emerging growth company.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years after our first sale of common stock pursuant to a Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, registration statement, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of our third quarter in any calendar year.\nOur status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it. Because of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are a small company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively and increase market share.\nThere is potential that we will face intense competition from other companies, some of which can be expected to have longer operating histories and more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than us. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nBecause of the early stage of the industry in which we intend to operate, we expect to face additional competition from new entrants. To be competitive, we will require a continued high level of investment in research and development, marketing, sales and client support. We may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and client support efforts on a competitive basis which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nWe will incur increased costs and become subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of becoming a public company, which could lower our profits, if any, or make it more difficult to run our business.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we have not incurred as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We will incur costs associated with the rules implemented by the SEC, any OTC market our common stock may become quoted on, and any national exchange that our common stock may become listed on. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. These laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nOne of our officers serves only on a part-time consulting basis, and she and other persons who work for us on a part-time consulting basis may be subject to conflicts of interest.\nWe have three employees, including Philippe Deschamps, our President, CEO and a director, and Jonathan Sackier, our Chief Medical Officer. All other persons who provide services to us do so on a part-time consulting basis. Each may devote part of his working time to other business endeavors, including consulting relationships with other corporate entities, and may have responsibilities to these other entities. For example, our Chief Financial Officer works for us on a part-time consulting basis and serves as the Assistant Manager, Corporate Finance of V Baron Global Financial Canada Ltd. Pursuant to an agreement with us, V Baron Global Financial Canada Ltd. offers consulting services to us for transaction structuring, corporate governance and compliance issues. Because of these relationships, some of the persons who provide services to us may be subject to conflicts of interest. Such conflicts may include deciding how much time to devote to our affairs, as well as what business opportunities should be presented to us.\nFurthermore, to the extent that our agreement with V Baron Global Financial Canada Ltd. is terminated, we will lose the services of our Chief Financial Officer.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nBefore we can market and sell our products, we will be required to obtain approval and clearance by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities which will take significant time and require significant research, development, and clinical study expenditures, and ultimately may not succeed.\nBefore we begin to label and market the PoNS\u2122 device for use in the United States, we are required to obtain clearance from the FDA under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, approval of a de novo reclassification petition for our product, or approval of pre-market approval application from the FDA, unless an exemption from pre-market review applies. We intend to utilize the de novo classification procedures to seek marketing authorization for the PoNS\u2122 device, because there is currently no predicate cleared or approved by the FDA for commercial distribution and no existing classification decision by the FDA for such a device. We will also be required to comply with costly and time-consuming compliance by foreign regulatory authorities if we want to sell our products outside of the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals, or completing the de novo classification process, to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to successfully obtain pre-market reviews on a timely basis, if at all.\nIf the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for the PoNS\u2122 device, introducing the product could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our launch to be delayed. In addition, the FDA may determine that the PoNS\u2122 device requires the more costly, lengthy and uncertain pre-market approval process. For example, if the FDA disagrees with our determination that the de novo classification procedures are the appropriate path to obtain marketing authorizations for the PoNS\u2122 device, the FDA may require us to submit a PMA application, which is generally more costly and uncertain and can take from one to three years, or longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained. Further, even with respect to those future products where a PMA is not required, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain 510(k) clearances with respect to those products.\nObtaining FDA clearance will be costly, may result in time-consuming delays and will subject us to ongoing compliance costs and regulatory risk for non-compliance.\nObtaining FDA clearance, de novo down-classification, or approval for medical devices can be expensive and uncertain, and generally takes from several months to several years, and generally requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data. Notwithstanding the expense, these efforts may never result in FDA clearance. Even if we were to obtain regulatory clearance, it may not be for the uses we believe are important or commercially attractive, in which case we would not be permitted to market our product for those uses.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u2022 we may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction that our product candidates are safe and effective, sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, for their intended users;\n\u2022 the data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required; and\n\u2022 the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. For example, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA initiated an evaluation of the program, and in January 2011, announced several proposed actions intended to reform the review process governing the clearance of medical devices. The FDA intends these reform actions to improve the efficiency and transparency of the clearance process, as well as bolster patient safety. In addition, as part of the FDASIA the U.S. Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several \u201cMedical Device Regulatory Improvements\u201d and miscellaneous reforms which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-approval. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearance or approval for our product candidates could prevent us from generating revenue from these product candidates and adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nEven if granted, a 510(k) clearance, de novo down-classification, or pre-market approval for any future product would likely place substantial restrictions on how our device is marketed or sold, and FDA will continue to place considerable restrictions on our products and operations. For example, the manufacture of medical devices must comply with FDA's QSR. In addition, manufacturers must register their manufacturing facilities, list the products with FDA, and comply with requirements relating to labeling, marketing, complaint handling, adverse event and medical device reporting, reporting of corrections and removals, and import and export. FDA monitors compliance with the QSR and these other requirements through periodic inspections. If our facilities or those of our manufacturers or suppliers are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, or if we or our manufacturers or suppliers fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection, the regulatory authority could take enforcement action, including any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022 untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022 customer notifications of repair, replacement, refunds, detention or seizure of our products\n\u2022 operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022 refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or pre-market approvals of new products or modified products;\n\u2022 withdrawing 510(k) marketing clearances or pre-market approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022 refusing to provide Certificates for Foreign Government;\n\u2022 refusing to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022 pursuing criminal prosecution\nAdditionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our product candidates and dissuade our customers from using our product candidates, if and when they are authorized for marketing.\nWe expect to be required to conduct clinical trials to support regulatory approval of some of our product candidates. We have no experience in the clinical trials process, they may proceed more slowly than anticipated, and we cannot be certain that our product candidates will be shown to be safe and effective for human use.\nIn order to commercialize our product candidates in the United States, we may be required by the FDA to submit an application for PMA for review and approval by the FDA. A PMA application must be submitted to the FDA if our device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) clearance process or is not exempt from premarket review by the FDA. We could also be required to submit a PMA application for other future product candidates. If we are required by the FDA to submit a PMA application, the FDA will also require us to conduct clinical trials. The FDA could also require us to provide the FDA with clinical trial data to support some of our 510(k) premarket notifications. We will receive approval or clearance from the FDA to commercialize products requiring a clinical trial only if we can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, through well-designed and properly conducted clinical trials, that our product candidates are safe and effective and otherwise meet the appropriate standards required for approval or clearance for specified indications.\nClinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and are subject to substantial and unanticipated delays. Before we may begin clinical trials, we must submit and obtain approval for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, that describes, among other things, the manufacture of, and controls for, the device and a complete investigational plan. Clinical trials generally involve a substantial number of patients in a multi-year study. Because we do not have the experience or the infrastructure necessary to conduct clinical trials, we will have to hire one or more contract research organizations, or CROs, to conduct trials on our behalf. CRO contract negotiations may be costly and time consuming and we will rely heavily on the CRO to ensure that our trials are conducted in accordance with regulatory and industry standards. We may encounter problems with our clinical trials and any of those problems could cause us or the FDA to suspend those trials, or delay the analysis of the data derived from them.\nA number of events or factors, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our clinical trials in the future and negatively impact our ability to obtain FDA approval for, and to introduce our product candidates:\n\u2022 failure to obtain financing necessary to bear the cost of designing and conducting clinical trials;\n\u2022 failure to obtain approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to commence investigational studies;\n\u2022 conditions imposed on us by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 failure to find a qualified CRO to conduct our clinical trials or to negotiate a CRO services agreement on favorable terms;\n\u2022 delays in obtaining or in our maintaining required approvals from institutional review boards or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;\n\u2022 insufficient supply of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022 difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022 negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results, that necessitate additional clinical studies;\n\u2022 failure on the part of the CRO to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 our failure to maintain a successful relationship with the CRO or termination of our contractual relationship with the CRO before completion of the clinical trials;\n\u2022 serious or unexpected side effects experienced by patients in whom our product candidates are implanted; or\n\u2022 failure by any of our third-party contractors or investigators to comply with regulatory requirements or meet other contractual obligations in a timely manner.\nOur clinical trials may need to be redesigned or may not be completed on schedule, if at all. Delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which could cause our stock price to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. In addition, if one or more of our clinical trials are delayed, competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.\nIf we are required to conduct clinical trials to obtain FDA clearance and approval, we will be substantially dependent on third parties to conduct clinical trials.\nIn the event we were required to conduct clinical trials to obtain FDA clearance, we would need to rely heavily on third parties over the course of our clinical trials, and as a result will have limited control over the clinical investigators and limited visibility into their day-to-day activities. Nevertheless, we would ultimately be responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties would be required to comply with current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable cGCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional nonclinical or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials may be required to be conducted with a large number of test patients. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nAny third parties conducting our clinical trials are not and will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical, and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nIf any of our relationships terminate with these third-party CROs, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO begins work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain a reimbursement code from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services so that the PoNS\u2122 device is covered under Medicare and Medicaid, this would have a negative impact on our intended sales and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe plan to submit an application to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for an International Classification of Disease 10 reimbursement code so that the PoNS\u2122 device is covered under Medicare and Medicaid. There can be no assurance that our application will be successful, or that we will be able to obtain a reimbursement code in a timely manner. In the event that we do not obtain a reimbursement code for the PoNS\u2122 device, our customers would be unable to obtain reimbursement for their purchases under private or government-sponsored insurance plans which would have a negative impact on sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf hospitals and other healthcare providers are unable to obtain coverage or adequate reimbursement for procedures performed with our products, our product will not likely be widely used.\nIn the United States, the commercial success of our existing product and any future products will depend, in part, on the extent to which governmental payers at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for procedures utilizing our products. Hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase our product for treatment of their patients generally rely on third-party payers to pay for all or part of the costs and fees associated with our products as part of a \u201cbundled\u201d rate for the associated procedures. The existence of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products and the procedures performed with them by government and private payers critical to market acceptance of our existing and future products. Neither hospitals nor physicians are likely to use our product and any future products if they do not receive adequate reimbursement for the procedures utilizing our products.\nMany private payers currently base their reimbursement policies on the coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by the CMS, which administers the Medicare program. Others may adopt different coverage or reimbursement policies for procedures performed with our products, while some governmental programs, such as Medicaid, have reimbursement policies that vary from state to state, some of which may not pay for the procedures performed with our products in an adequate amount, if at all. A Medicare national or local coverage decision denying coverage for one or more of our products could result in private and other third-party payers also denying coverage for our products. Third-party payers also may deny reimbursement for our products if they determine that a product used in a procedure was not medically necessary, was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payer, or was used for an unapproved use. Unfavorable coverage or reimbursement decisions by government programs or private payers underscore the uncertainty that our products face in the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany hospitals and clinics in the United States belong to group purchasing organizations, which typically incentivize their hospital members to make a relatively large proportion of purchases from a limited number of vendors of similar products that have contracted to offer discounted prices. Such contracts often include exceptions for purchasing certain innovative new technologies, however. Accordingly, the commercial success of our products may also depend to some extent on our ability to either negotiate favorable purchase contracts with key group purchasing organizations and/or persuade hospitals and clinics to purchase our product \u201coff contract.\u201d\nThe healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private payers seek to control healthcare costs by paying service providers lower rates. While we believe that hospitals will be able to obtain coverage for procedures using our products, the level of payment available to them for such procedures may change over time. State and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, closely regulate provider payment levels and have sought to contain, and sometimes reduce, payment levels. Private payers frequently follow government payment policies and are likewise interested in controlling increases in the cost of medical care. In addition, some payers are adopting pay-for-performance programs that differentiate payments to healthcare providers based on the achievement of documented quality-of-care metrics, cost efficiencies, or patient outcomes. These programs are intended to provide incentives to providers to deliver the same or better results while consuming fewer resources. As a result of these programs, and related payer efforts to reduce payment levels, hospitals and other providers are seeking ways to reduce their costs, including the amounts they pay to medical device manufacturers. We may not be able to sell our implants profitably if third-party payers deny or discontinue coverage or reduce their levels of payment below that which we project, or if our production costs increase at a greater rate than payment levels. Adverse changes in payment rates by payers to hospitals could adversely impact our ability to market and sell our products and negatively affect our financial performance.\nIn international markets, medical device regulatory requirements and healthcare payment systems vary significantly from country to country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. We cannot assure you that our products will be considered cost-effective by international third-party payers, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party payers\u2019 reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Any failure to receive regulatory or reimbursement approvals would negatively impact market acceptance of our products in any international markets in which those approvals are sought.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock does not have a well-establish trading market in the United States. Trading of our common stock is sporadic, and the price of our common stock may be volatile; we caution you as to the highly illiquid nature of an investment in our shares.\nOur shares are currently periodically quoted on the OTCQB. We have applied to list our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market and our application is still pending. However, there is no guarantee that our listing application to the Nasdaq Capital Market will be approved or, even if we were approved, that we will satisfy continuing listing requirements. As a result, a well-establish market for our common stock may never develop in the United States.\nOur common stock has been listed on the CSE since June 23, 2014. Our common stock is also restricted for immediate resale in Canada pursuant to Canadian securities laws. To date, trading on the CSE in our common stock has been limited and sporadic.\nSecurities of microcap and small-cap companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the companies\u2019 financial performance or prospects. We believe that trading in our stock, if it occurs at all, will likely be subject to significant volatility since, among other reasons, we do not have nor will we have in the foreseeable future an active trading market in our stock. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. Factors unrelated to our performance that may affect the price of our common stock include the following: the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business may be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not follow us, a reduction in trading volume and general market interest in our common stock may affect an investor\u2019s ability to trade significant numbers of shares of our common stock; the size of our public float may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our common stock; and a substantial decline in the price of shares of our common stock that persists for a significant period of time could cause our common stock, if listed on an exchange, to be delisted from such exchange, further reducing market liquidity. As a result of any of these factors, the market price of our common stock at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our long-term value. The price of our common shares may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including: changes in financial estimates; our acquisitions and financings; quarterly variations in our operating results; the operating and share price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; and purchase or sale of blocks of our common stock. These factors, or any of them, may materially adversely affect the prices of our common shares regardless of our operating performance. We caution you as to the highly illiquid nature of an investment in our shares.\nThe market price of our common stock is affected by many other variables which are not directly related to our success and are, therefore, not within our control. These include other developments that affect the breadth of the public market for shares of our common stock and the attractiveness of alternative investments. The effect of these and other factors on the market price of our common stock is expected to make our common stock price volatile in the future, which may result in losses to investors.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise any required working capital and adversely impact our operations.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise any required capital for our operations. Because our operations to date have been principally financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could have an adverse effect upon our liquidity and our continued operations. A reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future may have a material adverse effect upon our business plan and operations. If our stock price declines, we may not be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations.\nOur two major shareholders have the ability to take shareholder action without the involvement of our other shareholders.\nIn accordance with our governing documents, any action required to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if consents in writing setting forth the action so taken are signed by the holders of our outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be required to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and voted. Currently, our two major shareholders, MPJ Healthcare, LLC and ANR, hold approximately 50.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock and if they both consent in writing to take a particular corporate action, they could do so without a meeting that involves our other shareholders.\nOur two major shareholders may have the ability to take shareholder action at a shareholders' meeting even if they do not hold a majority of our outstanding common stock.\nAs long as our two major shareholders, MPJ Healthcare, LLC and ANR, collectively hold at least 33 1/3% of our outstanding common stock, they may be able to effect a vote requiring shareholder approval. In accordance with our governing documents, shareholders holding at least five percent of all the votes entitled to be cast on a proposal may call a special meeting to vote on the proposal. Also in accordance with our governing documents, quorum for a shareholders' meeting is at least 33 1/3% of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote and, where quorum is present, shareholder action may be taken by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote. Accordingly, if our two major shareholders call a meeting and establish quorum, they can effect shareholder approval on a proposal unless other shareholders holding a greater number of shares than our two major shareholders were present at the meeting, either in person or by proxy, and vote against the proposal. There is no guarantee that such other shareholders will be present at any such meeting or, even if they were present at such meeting, will vote against the proposal.\nWe have not paid any dividends and do not foresee paying dividends in the future.\nWe intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be reviewed periodically by the board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, conditions then existing including earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business opportunities and other factors.\nOur stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC\u2019s penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nOur stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d. The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000, not including any equity in that person\u2019s or person\u2019s spouse\u2019s primary residence, or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse for two consecutive years. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.\nAny future sales of our equity securities will dilute the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders and may decrease the market price for our common stock.\nFuture sales or issuances of equity securities, including the issuance of 8,882,032 shares of our common stock underlying warrants currently exercisable, could decrease the value of our common stock, dilute stockholders\u2019 voting power and reduce future potential earnings per share. We intend to sell additional equity securities in future offerings (including through the sale of securities convertible into shares of our common stock) and may issue additional equity securities to finance our operations, development, acquisitions or other projects. We cannot predict the size of future sales and issuances of equity securities or the effect, if any, that future sales and issuances of equity securities will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of equity securities, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. With any additional sale or issuance of equity securities, investors will suffer dilution of their voting power and may experience dilution in our earnings per share.\nWe are authorized to issue an unlimited number of common stock which could result in substantial dilution to your investment in our shares.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of an unlimited number of common shares, which shares can be issued for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as are established by our board of directors without the approval of any of our shareholders. We may issue additional common shares in connection with a future financing or acquisition. The issuance of additional common shares may dilute an investor\u2019s investment in us and reduce cash available for distribution per common share, if any dividends are declared by the board of directors in the future.", "PERMNO": 17690, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "HSDT"}
