{"cik": "26324", "company": "CURTISS WRIGHT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe have summarized the known, material risks to our business below. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows, and require significant management time and attention. In addition to the risks and uncertainties set forth in section below entitled \u201cRisks Related to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,\" many of the risks and uncertainties set forth in the other risk factors are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, corresponding government and business responses, and any further resulting decline in the global business and economic environment, and may be impacted by the extent and speed of the global economic recovery. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q\u2019s, Form 8-K\u2019s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to pose risks to our business, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated pandemic-related responses continue to cause significant and volatile disruptions in global economies, in capital markets, and across industries. While we continue to actively monitor the pandemic and take steps to mitigate the risks posed by its spread, there is no guarantee that our efforts will mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19 or will be effective.\nThe pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, certain elements of our business, including our supply chain and production levels. As of December 31, 2021, all of our manufacturing operations are operational. However, we are unable to predict if there will be additional government-imposed restrictions on our ability to operate in future periods. Additionally, our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees. The ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by the individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19 and its variants. While we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees, these measures are not always successful, and we may be required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures. Potential future directives curtailing in-person operations due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic could change at any time. This could have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of such manufacturing facilities, which could in turn adversely impact our business and operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain to a certain extent and availability of raw materials, particularly electronic parts. Because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand, our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms.\nWe continue to monitor the situation, assessing possible implications on our operations, supply chain, liquidity, cash flow and customer orders, and will continue taking actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. Recognizing the unprecedented\nnature, scale and uncertainty associated with this global health crisis, the duration and extent of the ongoing impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nIntrusion on our systems could damage our business.\nWe store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information on our servers and databases. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including empowering many of our office-based associates to work productively from home on a hybrid basis when appropriate to do so. As a result, we are increasingly dependent upon our information systems to operate our business. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability, and adequacy of our information systems. In addition, various privacy and securities laws require us to manage and protect sensitive and confidential information, including personal data of our employees, from disclosure. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, extends the scope of the European Union data protection laws to all companies processing data of European Union residents, regardless of the company's location. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems as well as provide training to our employees in an attempt to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions, but in the future, it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. While we carry cyber insurance, we still may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nPotential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities for personal injury, death, or property damage due to the failure of a product that we have sold. We typically agree to indemnify our customers against certain liabilities resulting from the products we sell, and any third-party indemnification we seek from our suppliers and our liability insurance may not fully cover our indemnification obligations to customers. We may also not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability for which third-party indemnification is not available that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, an accident caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for selling quality products. We believe that our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting our products and believe that our reputation for quality assurance is a significant competitive strength. If an accident were to be caused by one of our products, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to liability under warranty obligations.\nThe majority of our contracts contain provisions which expose us to potential liability for warranty claims made by customers or third parties with respect to products that have been designed, manufactured, or serviced by us or our suppliers. Material product warranty obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, our contracts may be terminated and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including liquidated damages and penalties.\nIn general, our contracts may be terminated for our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. Our inability to sufficiently satisfy contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.\nOur businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. Our supply chain has been and may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic. We depend on these subcontractors and suppliers to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Nonperformance or underperformance by subcontractors and suppliers could materially impact our ability to perform obligations to our customers, which could result in a customer terminating our contract for default, expose us to liability, and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. Generally, raw materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, our supply networks can sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases on a timely basis.\nOur business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.\nOur manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGY\nImplementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of our capital allocation strategy, we aim to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions and technologies that supplement our organic growth. We are continuing to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance. Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for several reasons, including:\n\u2022Encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions;\n\u2022Increased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs;\n\u2022Consolidation in our industry, reducing the number of acquisition targets;\n\u2022Competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions; and\n\u2022Acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions, including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition, which could be exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:\n\u2022The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;\n\u2022Technological and product synergies, economies of scale, or cost reductions may not occur as expected;\n\u2022Management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses;\n\u2022We may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities;\n\u2022We may experience unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems;\n\u2022We may fail to retain or assimilate employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022We may experience problems in retaining customers or integrating customer bases; and\n\u2022We may encounter difficulties in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience.\nFailure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.\nVirtually all products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to: identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets; develop and manufacture competitive products, systems, and services; enhance our offerings by adding technological innovations that differentiate our products, systems, and services from those of our competitors; and develop, manufacture, and bring those products, systems, and service to market quickly at cost-effective prices.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets.\nMany of our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and are affected by varying degrees of competition. We compete against companies that often have higher sales volumes and greater financial, technological, research and development, human, and marketing resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns, including withstanding the current global pandemic. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, product quality, product performance, price, technical expertise, timeliness of delivery, superior customer service and support, and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.\nObtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.\nIn addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We generally require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.\nRISKS RELATED TO MARKET CONDITIONS\nA substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.\nIn 2021, approximately 50% of our total net sales were derived from or related to U.S. defense programs. U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country\u2019s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending over a ten-year\nperiod through 2021. These spending caps and reductions, referred to as sequestration, went into effect in March 2013. Through a series of bipartisan agreements, Congress has been able to temporarily lift discretionary spending limits every year through 2019. On August 2, 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA) was signed into law, which raised the BCA budget caps for both defense and non-defense discretionary spending in 2020 and 2021 and extended the mandatory BCA spending reductions through 2029. Absent additional legislative or other remedial action, the sequestration could require reduced U.S. federal government spending from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2029. As a result of this uncertainty, a decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. In the event that one or more of our programs are reduced, delayed, or terminated for which we provide products and services, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe BBA also temporarily suspended the public debt limit through July 31, 2021, which Congress temporarily extended through December 3, 2021. However, on December 16, 2021, President Biden signed legislation into law increasing the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, which is expected to allow the U.S. government to cover its debt obligations into fiscal year 2023. Failure by Congress to further suspend or increase the debt ceiling could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services, and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments.\nA downturn in the aircraft market could adversely affect our business.\nOur sales to large commercial aircraft manufacturers are cyclical in nature and can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including current and future passenger traffic levels, increasing fuel and labor costs, environmental concerns, inclusive of climate change, intense price competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, outbreak of infectious disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist attacks, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits, and backlog levels, all of which can be unpredictable and are outside our control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced air traffic as travel restrictions and social distancing measures were implemented to help control the spread of the virus. The reduced air traffic applied financial pressures on airlines, who, in order to preserve cash and liquidity, dramatically reduced flight hours and delayed the purchases of new aircraft. Although U.S. domestic air travel has increased during 2021, international travel has not yet begun to recover at the same pace. Given the uncertain length of this pandemic and associated restrictions to travel long distances, the commercial market may shift away from wide-body aircraft. Furthermore, as companies and employees become accustomed to working remotely, business travel and the associated flight hours may not reach the pre-pandemic levels. Any decrease in demand resulting from a downturn in the aerospace market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.\nBacklog represents products or services that our customers have contractually committed to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). We are a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2021 was $2.2 billion. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The timing of backlog may be impacted by project delays. The U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. We believe that these risks are heightened due to the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to numerous procurement rules and regulations.\nWe must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government\ncontracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.\nA termination arising out of our default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.\nOur U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.\nFurthermore, we are subject to other risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:\n\u2022the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;\n\u2022the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;\n\u2022contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;\n\u2022cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase; and\n\u2022the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors.\nOur operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions. Noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.\nWe have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Because the COVID-19 pandemic has so negatively impacted local economies, government intervention has increased, which in turn can create elevated risk and opportunity for corruption. Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. From time to time, we may file voluntary disclosure reports with the U.S. Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce regarding certain violations of U.S. export control laws and regulations discovered by us in the course of our business activities, employee training, or internal reviews and audits. To date, our voluntary disclosures have not resulted in a fine, penalty, or export privilege denial or restriction that has had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or ability to export. Our failure, or failure by our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.\nGovernmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include documentation with our products sold to aircraft manufacturing customers certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, the Corporation as well as the products that we manufacture must also be certified by our individual OEM customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of such product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to liability under environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.\nOur business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. We are also subject to worker health and safety requirements as well as various state and local public health laws, rules, regulations and orders related to COVID-19, including mask and social distancing requirements. While we are in compliance with government health and safety regulations related to COVID-19, the cost of complying, or failing to comply, with these regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination, or breach of contract. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by climate change regulations.\nClimate change regulations at the federal, state, or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions, change our manufacturing processes, obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions, fund offset projects, or undertake other costly activities. These regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment. New permits may be required for our current operations, or expansions thereof. Failure to timely receive permits could result in fines, suspension of production, or cessation of operations at one or more facilities. In addition, restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and the passing down of carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, and renewable portfolio standards by utility companies. The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nIncreasing focus on environmental, social, and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks.\nIncreasing focus on environmental, social, and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks. Regulators, stockholders, and other interested constituencies have focused increasingly on the environmental, social, and governance practices of companies. Our customers may require us to implement environmental, social, or governance responsibility procedures or standards before they continue to do business with us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event that our environmental, social, or governance responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL MATTERS\nPolitical and economic changes in foreign countries and markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, may have a material effect on our operating results.\nDuring 2021, approximately 26% of our total net sales were to customers outside of the United States. Additionally, we also have operating facilities located in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability and potential for social unrest, the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, restrictions on the repatriation of funds, restrictive trade policies, tariff regulations, difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses, government financed competition, changes in the local labor-relations climate, economic conditions in local markets, health concerns (including the COVID-19 pandemic), complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change, and limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the British Pound, Euro, and Canadian dollar. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. The Biden administration announced in 2021 several tax proposals to fund new government investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, among others. Certain of these proposals involve an increase in the domestic corporate tax rate, which if implemented could have a material impact on our future results of operations and cash flows. In addition, on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, included certain changes in tax law intended to stimulate the U.S. economy in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary beneficial changes to the treatment of net operating losses, interest deductibility limitations, and payroll tax matters. The CARES Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact our business unfavorably. Additionally, tax rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate or sell into may increase as a means of funding the significant cost of governmental stimulus measures enacted to assist and protect individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws or changes in tax rates may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in our tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof.\nFurthermore, the amount of income taxes paid by us is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such examinations. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed were for an amount in excess of amounts reserved, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.\nLong-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total\nrevenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nOur future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $2.0 billion, which represented approximately 49% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. For example, if the financial performance of such business was to decline significantly, we could incur a material non-cash charge to our income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $1.0 billion of debt outstanding. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt; reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business; making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates; limiting us from obtaining additional debt; and impacting our ability to pay dividends.\nWe self-insure health benefits and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience.\nWe are primarily self-insured for our health benefits. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect to periodically assess our self-insurance strategy. We are required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. In addition, because we do not carry \u201cstop loss\u201d insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability.\nIncreasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial markets and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans\u2019 funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.\nGENERAL RISKS\nOur future growth and continued success are dependent upon our key personnel.\nOur success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Additionally, it is particularly difficult to hire new employees during the COVID-19 pandemic as conducting interviews remotely makes it more difficult to ensure that we are recruiting and hiring high-quality employees. Further, the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic makes it less likely that potential candidates will be willing to leave a stable job to explore a new opportunity. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. As some of our key executives approach retirement age, we have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. However, we may be required to devote significant time and resources to identify and integrate key new personnel should key management losses occur earlier than anticipated. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOn September 9, 2021, President Biden directed the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (\u201cETS\u201d) requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated for COVID-19 or obtain a negative COVID-19 test at least once a week. President Biden also issued an Executive Order requiring certain COVID-19 precautions for government contractors and their subcontractors, including mandatory employee vaccination, with exemptions only for medical or religious reasons. On November 4, 2021, the OSHA issued an emergency regulation to carry out this mandate, which was expected to take effect on January 4, 2022. However, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a nationwide stay prohibiting OSHA from enforcing or implementing the ETS. But many states and localities are free to impose vaccine requirements. Despite the previous legal and timing uncertainties relating to these regulations, we implemented requirements regarding mandatory vaccines for U.S. based covered employees, subject to approved exemptions. It is possible that additional vaccine and testing mandates may be announced in other jurisdictions in which we operate our business. While it is not currently possible to predict with any certainty the exact impact any new state, local or foreign vaccine regulations would have on our operations, our suppliers and our customers, the implementation of such state, local or foreign government mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees, attract new employees, and result in labor disruptions and may have an adverse effect on future profitability. Further, implementation could also have similar consequences for our subcontractors, which may impact their ability to deliver the goods and services we need from them. In addition, any requirement to impose obligations on our suppliers under the Executive Order covering government contractors and their subcontractors could impact the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, whereby our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, or if tariffs or other restrictions on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell were to increase.\nA significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and Canada. Our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) and relies on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market, and sell our products globally. Although there are no immediate effects on our operations with respect to USMCA, we cannot predict future developments in the political climate involving the United States, Mexico and Canada, and thus, these may have an adverse and material impact on our operations and financial growth.\nThe United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods (such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years). Some of our products are included in these tariffs. All of this could lead to increased costs and diminished sales opportunities in the U.S. and abroad. Media and political reactions in the affected countries could potentially exacerbate the impact on our operations in those countries. The imposition of new or increased tariffs, duties, border adjustment taxes or other trade restrictions by the United States could also result in the adoption of new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions by other countries. The tariffs may in the future increase our cost of materials and may cause us to increase prices to our customers which we believe may reduce demand for our products. Our price increases may not be sufficient to fully offset the impact of the tariffs and result in lowering our margin on products sold. If the U.S. government increases or implements additional tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by other countries, the resulting trade barriers could have a significant adverse impact on our suppliers, our customers and on our business. We are not able to predict future trade policy of the U.S. or of any foreign countries in which we operate or purchase goods, or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements, or their impact on our business.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAlthough we currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity, global macroeconomic uncertainty, including the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China, the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets could affect our ability to fund our operations. In addition, certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships, which could impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers and suppliers. Depending on their severity and duration, the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.\nApproximately 7% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results if we are subject to labor actions.\nFuture terror attacks, war, natural disasters, climate change-related events, pandemic diseases (including the COVID-19 pandemic), or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.\nDespite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions through insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, we could be adversely impacted by terror attacks, war, natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, climate change-related events, pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, or other events such as strikes by the workforce of a significant customer or supplier. These risks could negatively impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural disasters. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays by our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concern of another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 89223, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "CW"}
