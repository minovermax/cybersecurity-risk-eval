{"cik": "1415404", "company": "EchoStar CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. If any of the following events occur or evolve in a way different than expected, our business, financial condition, results of operation, prospects or ability to fund a share or debt repurchase program, invest capital in or otherwise run our business, execute on our strategic plans or return capital to our shareholders could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects continue to develop, it is impossible at this time to predict its ultimate impact on our business. We have set forth some key risks identified to date.\nOur operations, and those of our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other third parties with whom we conduct business, including regulatory agencies, have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted our and our customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019, vendors\u2019 and other business partners\u2019 and investees\u2019 businesses, and have delayed the manufacture and deployment of our satellites. Disruption to our vendors\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 businesses could adversely impact our supply chain. Additionally, some regulatory bodies have reduced activities and/or temporarily closed their offices which may materially delay the review and/or approval of licenses or authorizations we need to operate our business. We cannot currently estimate or determine the final magnitude of these impacts.\nAdditionally, many of our subscribers are working remotely or engaging in distance learning. These activities have increased the usage on our HughesNet service so that there is little or no capacity remaining for subscriber growth in our most popular geographic areas. This limitation on capacity may result in our subscribers experiencing slower speeds, which, in turn, could result in higher churn and may negatively affect our business.\nA portion of the expected sales of our products or services have been, and additional sales may be, delayed or canceled as a result of effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of our customers.\nDue to the economic downturn arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of our enterprise customers are facing uncertain futures and certain of these customers have filed for bankruptcy protection. When enterprise customers fail or seek reorganization under the bankruptcy laws, we may be obliged to provide services for which we are not being paid. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased unemployment, which could result in reduced demand and increased inability to pay from our consumer customers.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nWe may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, capital expenditures, the development, acquisition and launch of new satellites and other strategic initiatives to complement or expand our business, which may not be successful and we may lose a portion or all of our investment.\nOur success may depend on the existence of, and our ability to capitalize on, opportunities to acquire or develop other businesses or technologies or partner with other companies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business, services or products or that may otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may pursue a number of strategic initiatives to complement or expand our business. Any such strategic initiatives may involve a high degree of risk, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the risks associated with developing and constructing new satellites;\n\u2022the diversion of our management\u2019s attention away from our existing business onto a strategic initiative;\n\u2022possible adverse effects on our and our targets\u2019 and partners\u2019 business, financial condition or operating results during the integration process;\n\u2022exposure to significant financial losses if the strategic initiatives are not successful;\n\u2022the inability to obtain regulatory approvals in the anticipated time frame, or at all;\n\u2022the risks associated with complying with regulations applicable to the acquired or developed business or technologies which may cause us to incur substantial expenses;\n\u2022the disruption of relationships with employees, vendors or customers; and\n\u2022the risks associated with foreign and international operations and/or investments or dispositions.\nNew strategic initiatives may require the commitment of significant capital that would otherwise have been directed to investments in our existing businesses or distributed to shareholders.\nWe could face decreased demand and increased pricing pressure with respect to our products and services due to competition.\nOur business operates in an intensely competitive, consumer- and enterprise-driven and rapidly changing environment and competes with a growing number of companies that provide similar products and services to consumer and enterprise customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete against our competitors due to their significant resources and operating history. Material competitive risks to our business include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Competition from new or different technology compared to our offerings;\n\u2022Competition from existing or new competitors entering the same markets we serve;\n\u2022Government funding for competing products and services, reducing demand for our products and services; and\n\u2022Competitive pressures to provide enhanced functionality for the same or lower price with each new generation of technology.\nOur business will be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately anticipate our satellite capacity needs or are unable to obtain satellite capacity.\nWe have made substantial contractual commitments for satellite capacity based on our existing customer contracts and backlog. If our existing customer contracts were to be terminated prior to their respective expiration dates, we may have insufficient revenue to cover our satellite capacity costs. On the other hand, we may not have sufficient satellite capacity available to meet increases in demand and we may not be able to quickly or easily adjust our capacity to such changes in demand. At present, until the launch and operation of additional satellites that our systems can utilize, there is limited additional capacity in North America, including within our own fleet of satellites, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide services to customers and grow our revenue and business. Our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to renew our capacity leases at economically viable rates, or if sufficient capacity is not available to us.\nWe are dependent upon third-party providers for components, manufacturing, installation services and customer support services, and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if any of these third-party providers fail to appropriately deliver the contracted goods or services.\nOur dependence upon third-party providers causes certain risks to our business, including the following:\n\u2022Components. A limited number of suppliers manufacture, and in some cases a single supplier manufactures, some of the key components required to build our products. We do not generally maintain long-term agreements with our suppliers or subcontractors for our products. If we change or lose suppliers, we could experience a delay in manufacturing our products, or we may be unable to produce our products at competitive prices and we may be unable to satisfy demand from our customers.\n\u2022Commodity Price Risk. Fluctuations in pricing of raw materials can affect our product costs and we may not be able to pass on the increased costs to our customers.\n\u2022Manufacturing. While we develop and manufacture prototypes for certain of our products, we use contract manufacturers to produce a significant portion of our hardware. If these contract manufacturers fail to provide products that meet our specifications in a timely manner or at all, our business could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022Installation, customer support, and other services. Some of our products and services utilize a network of third-party service providers. A decline in levels of service or attention to the needs of our customers could adversely affect our reputation, renewal rates and ability to win and retain customers. In addition, if the agreements for the provision of these services are terminated or not renewed, we could face difficulties replacing these service providers.\nOur foreign operations and investments expose us to risks and restrictions not present in our domestic operations.\nOur sales outside the U.S. accounted for 19.6%, 20.4% and 19.2% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect our foreign operations to represent a significant and growing portion of our business. Our foreign operations involve varying degrees of risk and uncertainties inherent in doing business abroad. Such risks include:\n\u2022Complications in complying with restrictions on foreign ownership and investment and limitations on repatriation of earnings. We may not be permitted to be the sole owner of our operations in some countries and may have to enter into partnership or joint venture relationships. Many foreign legal regimes and/or our contractual arrangements restrict our repatriation of earnings to the U.S. from our subsidiaries and joint venture entities. Applicable law in such foreign countries may also limit our ability to distribute or access our assets or offer our products and services in certain circumstances. In such event, we will not have unrestricted access to the cash flow and assets of our subsidiaries and joint ventures.\n\u2022Regulatory restrictions. Satellite market access, landing rights and terrestrial wireless rights are dependent on the national regulations established by foreign governments and international non-governmental bodies. Non-compliance with these requirements may result in the loss of the authorizations and licenses to conduct business in these countries, as well as fines, penalties, or other sanctions.\n\u2022Financial and legal constraints and obligations. Operating pursuant to foreign licenses subjects us to certain financial constraints and obligations, including, but not limited to: (a) tax liabilities that may or may not be dependent on revenue; (b) the regulatory requirements associated with maintaining such licenses, which may be subject to interpretation by foreign courts and regulatory bodies; (c) the burden of creating and maintaining additional entities, branches, facilities and/or staffing in foreign jurisdictions; and (d) regulations requiring that we make certain satellite capacity available for \u201cfree\u201d or available at reduced rates.\n\u2022Compliance with applicable export control laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries. We must comply with all applicable export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. A violation any export or trade-related regulations could materially adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, recessions and currency devaluations have affected, and may in the future affect, revenue, profits and cash earned from our international businesses.\n\u2022Regulations may favor state-owned enterprises or local service providers. Many of the countries in which we conduct business have traditionally had state-owned or state-granted monopolies on telecommunications services that favor an incumbent service provider. We face competition from these favored and entrenched companies in countries that have not liberalized.\nWe may not be able to generate cash to meet our debt service needs or fund our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was $2.4 billion. Our ability to make payments on or to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash, we may be forced to take actions such as revising or delaying our strategic plans, reducing or delaying capital expenditures and/or the development, design, acquisition and construction of new satellites, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to implement any of these actions on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nCovenants in our indentures restrict our business in many ways.\nThe indentures governing the Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation (\u201cHSSC\u201d) 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2021, 5.250% Senior Secured Notes due August 1, 2026 and 6.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due August 1, 2026 contain various covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that limit HSSC\u2019s ability and/or certain of its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022pay dividends or make distributions on HSSC\u2019s capital stock or repurchase HSSC\u2019s capital stock;\n\u2022allow to exist certain restrictions on such subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, make distributions, make other payments, or transfer assets;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022create liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022merge or consolidate with another company; and\n\u2022transfer and sell assets.\nFailure to comply with these and certain other financial covenants, if not cured or waived, may result in an event of default under the indentures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. If certain events of default occur and are continuing under the respective indenture, the trustee under that indenture or the requisite holders of the notes under that indenture may declare all such notes to be immediately due and payable and, in the case of the indenture governing our secured notes, could proceed against the collateral that secures the secured notes. If certain other events of default occur, the indentures will become immediately due and payable. Certain of our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure the 5.250% Senior Secured Notes due August 1, 2026.\nA natural disaster could diminish our ability to provide service to our customers.\nNatural disasters could damage or destroy our ground infrastructure and/or our other or our vendors\u2019 infrastructure, equipment and facilities, resulting in a disruption of service to our customers, which may adversely affect our business. We currently have backup systems and technology in place to safeguard our antennas and protect our ground infrastructure during natural disasters, but the possibility still exists that our ground infrastructure and/or our other and our vendors\u2019 infrastructure, equipment and facilities could be impacted during a major natural disaster.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR HUMAN CAPITAL\nWe rely on key personnel and the loss of their services may negatively affect our businesses.\nWe believe that our future success depends to a significant extent upon the performance of Mr. Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, and certain other key executives. The loss of Mr. Ergen or certain other key executives, the ability to effectively provide for the succession of our senior management, or the ability of Mr. Ergen or such other key executives to devote sufficient time and effort to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although some of our key executives may have agreements relating to their equity compensation that limit their ability to work for or consult with competitors, we generally do not have employment agreements with them. To the extent Mr. Ergen is performing services for both DISH Network and us, his attention may be diverted away from our business and therefore adversely affect our business.\nOur business growth and customer retention strategies rely in part on the work of technically skilled employees.\nOur response to technological developments depends, to a significant degree, on the work of technically skilled employees. In addition, we have made and will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products, services, satellites and related technologies, as well as entry into new business areas. Investments in new technologies, satellites and business areas are inherently dependent on these technically skilled employees as well. Competition for the services of such employees has become more intense as demand for these types of employees grows. We compete with other companies for these employees and although we strive to attract and retain these employees, we may not succeed in these respects. Additionally, if we were to lose certain key technically skilled employees, the loss of knowledge and intellectual capital might have an adverse impact on business.\nRestrictions on immigration or increased enforcement of immigration laws could limit our access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase our cost of doing business or otherwise disrupt our operations.\nThe success of our business is dependent on our ability to recruit engineers and other professionals, including those who are citizens of other countries. Immigration laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate are subject to legislative and regulatory changes, as well as variations in the standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions. It is difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws, or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or renewing work visas for our professionals. If immigration laws are changed or if new and more restrictive government regulations are enacted or increased, our access to qualified and skilled professionals may be limited.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SATELLITES\nOur ability to operate and control our satellites is subject to risks related to DISH Network\u2019s operation of the BSS Business and third-parties\u2019 operation of satellite operations centers.\nIn connection with the BSS Transaction, we transferred our satellite operation centers, which are used to monitor and control our satellites, to DISH Network. Therefore, we now are subject to the inherent risks of having a related party operate, maintain and manage these satellite operations centers. In addition, certain of our satellites are operated, maintained and managed by third parties.\nOur owned and leased satellites in orbit are subject to significant operational and environmental risks that could limit our ability to utilize these satellites.\nSatellites are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, which have occurred and may occur in the future in our satellites and the satellites of other operators. Any single anomaly could materially and adversely affect our ability to utilize the satellite. Anomalies may also reduce the expected capacity, commercial operation and/or useful life of a satellite, thereby reducing the revenue that could be generated by that satellite, or create additional expenses due to the need to provide replacement or back-up satellites or satellite capacity earlier than planned and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we work closely with the satellite manufacturers to determine and eliminate the cause of anomalies in new satellites and provide for redundancies of many critical components in the satellites, we may not be able to prevent the impacts of anomalies in the future.\nMeteoroid events, decommissioned satellites, and increased solar activity also pose a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites. We may be required to perform maneuvers to avoid collisions and these maneuvers may prove unsuccessful or could reduce the useful life of the satellite through the expenditure of fuel to perform these maneuvers.\nGenerally, the minimum design life of each of our satellites is 15 years. We can provide no assurance, however, as to the actual operational lives of our satellites, which may be shorter or longer than their design lives. Our ability to earn revenue depends on the continued operation of our satellites, each of which has a limited useful life.\nWe generally do not carry in-orbit insurance on our satellites or payloads because we have assessed that the cost of insurance is not economical relative to the risk of failures. If one or more of our in-orbit uninsured satellites or payloads fail, we could be required to record significant impairment charges for the satellite or payload.\nOur satellites under construction are subject to risks related to construction, technology, regulations and launch that could limit our ability to utilize these satellites, increase costs and adversely affect our business.\nSatellite construction and launch are subject to significant risks, including delays, anomalies, launch failure and incorrect orbital placement. The technologies in our satellite designs are very complex and difficulties in constructing our designs could result in delays in the deployment of our satellites or increased or unanticipated costs. There can be no assurance that the technologies in our existing satellites or in new satellites that we design, acquire and build will work as we expect, will not become obsolete, that we will realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of our satellite designs or our new satellites, and/or that we will obtain all regulatory approvals required to operate our new or acquired satellites. Launch anomalies and failures can result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites, which can take significant amounts of time, and to obtain other launch opportunities. Such significant delays could materially affect our business, our ability to meet regulatory or contractual required milestones, the availability and our use of other or replacement satellite resources and our ability to provide services to customers. In addition, significant delays in a satellite program could give customers who have purchased or reserved capacity on that satellite a right to terminate their service contracts relating to the satellite. We may not be able to accommodate affected customers on other satellites until a replacement satellite is available.\nOur use of certain satellites is often dependent on satellite coordination agreements, which may be difficult to obtain.\nSatellite operators are required to enter into international spectrum coordination agreements with other affected satellite operators and must be approved by the relevant governments. If a required agreement cannot be concluded, we may have to operate the applicable satellite(s) in a manner that does not cause harmful radio frequency interference with the affected satellite. If we cannot do so, we may have to cease operating such satellite(s) at the affected orbital locations.\nWe may face interference from other services sharing satellite spectrum.\nThe FCC and other regulators have adopted rules or may adopt rules in the future that require us to share spectrum on a basis with other radio services. There can be no assurance that these operations would not interfere with our operations and adversely affect our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY\nOur future growth depends on growing demand for our services.\nFuture demand and effective delivery for our products and services will depend significantly on the growing demand for our services, such as broadband internet connectivity. If the deployment of, or demand for, our services is not as widespread or as rapid as we or our customers expect, our revenue growth will be negatively impacted.\nOur business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, licenses and other agreements to conduct our business. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement could result in significant monetary liability and require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if any such challenges or claims prove to be without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business.\nMoreover, we rely in part on technologies developed or licensed by third parties. If we are unable to obtain or retain licenses or other required intellectual property rights from these third parties on reasonable terms, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we work with suppliers for the development and manufacture of components that are integrated into our products and our products may contain technologies provided to us by these suppliers. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether any such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others, or whether such suppliers have obtained or continue to obtain the appropriate\nlicenses or other intellectual property rights to use such technology. Our suppliers may not be required to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount. Legal challenges to these intellectual property rights may impair our ability to use the products and technologies that we need in order to operate our business and may have a material adverse effect on our business. See further discussion under Item 1. Business - Patents and Trademarks and Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K.\nLitigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences.\nWe are involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, audits, consumer claims and governmental and other legal proceedings. Some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities. The timing of the final resolutions is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments, settlements, injunctions or liabilities, any of which could require substantial payments or have other adverse impacts on our business.\nWe are exposed to significant cybersecurity threats and risks.\nWe and third parties with whom we work face a constantly evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats in which hackers and other parties use a complex assortment of techniques and methods to execute cyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents have increased significantly in quantity and severity and are expected to continue to increase. Additionally, the risk of cyberattacks and compromises will likely increase as we continue to expand our business into other areas of the world outside of North America, some of which are still developing their cybersecurity infrastructure maturity. Should we be affected by a material cyber-related incident, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other material negative consequences.\nOur business is subject to varying degrees of regulation that include programs designed to review our protections against cybersecurity threats and risks. If it is determined that our systems do not reasonably protect our partners\u2019 assets and data and/or that we have violated these regulations, we could be subject to enforcement activity and sanctions.\nWe expect to continue to incur increasing costs in preparing our infrastructure and maintaining it to resist cyberattacks. There can be no assurance that we can successfully detect, deter, prevent or mitigate the effects of cyberattacks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, costs, operations, prospects, results of operation or financial position. Furthermore, the amount and scope of insurance that we maintain against losses resulting from these events may not be sufficient to compensate us adequately for any disruptions to our business or otherwise cover our losses, including reputational harm and negative publicity as well as any litigation liability.\nCompliance with data privacy laws may be costly, and non-compliance with such laws may result in significant liability.\nThe personal information and data we process and store is increasingly subject to data security and data privacy laws of many jurisdictions. These laws impose a significant compliance burden and complying with them has required us to change our business practices or the functionality of our products and services. Privacy laws and regulations are becoming more complex and onerous, and a data privacy breach could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our products contain defects, we could be subject to significant costs to correct such defects and our product and network service contracts could be delayed or cancelled, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nThe products and the networks we deploy are highly complex, and some may contain defects when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released, despite testing and our quality control procedures. Defects may also occur in components and products that we purchase from third parties. In addition, many of our products and network services are designed to interface with our customers\u2019 existing networks, each of which has different specifications and utilizes multiple protocol standards. Our products and services must interoperate with the other products and services within our customers\u2019 networks, as well as with future products and services that might be added to these networks, to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix all defects in the products and networks we sell. The occurrence of any defects, errors or failures in our products or network services could materially affect our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE REGULATION OF OUR BUSINESS\nThe risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations, including the risk of changes to laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is regulated by numerous governmental agencies and other regulatory bodies, both domestically and internationally. In addition, our international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of many different jurisdictions that may differ significantly from U.S. laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines or penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Additionally, our ability to operate and grow our business depends on laws and regulations that govern the frequency bands and/or orbital locations we operate in or may operate in in the future.\nThese laws and regulations are subject to the administrative and political process and do change from time to time. Our business could suffer a material adverse impact if laws and regulations change and we are not able to adapt to these changes efficiently.\nOur business depends on regulatory authorizations issued by the FCC and state and foreign regulators that can expire, be revoked or modified, and applications for licenses and other authorizations that may not be granted.\nGenerally, all licenses granted by the FCC and most other countries are subject to expiration unless renewed by the regulatory agency. Our satellite licenses are currently set to expire at various times. In addition, we occasionally receive special temporary authorizations that are granted for limited periods of time (e.g., 180 days or less) and subject to possible renewal. Generally, our licenses and special temporary authorizations have been renewed on a routine basis, but there can be no assurance that this will continue.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE BSS TRANSACTION\nCertain of our directors and executive officers have interests in the BSS Transaction that may be different from, or in addition to, those of our other stockholders.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers have interests in the BSS Transaction that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. Our directors and executive officers who own shares of our common stock participated in the Distribution and the Merger on the same terms as our other stockholders. Additionally, Mr. Ergen, is a director and Chairman of both us and DISH. The EchoStar parties that approved the BSS Transaction, were aware of and considered these interests, among other things, in deciding to approve the terms of the Master Transaction Agreement and the BSS Transaction.\nIf the Distribution and the Merger do not qualify as a tax-free distribution and merger under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), then we and/or our stockholders may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes and under certain circumstances we may have indemnification obligations to DISH Network.\nThe parties to the BSS Transaction received a tax opinion from their respective counsels as to the tax-free nature of the transactions. They did not obtain a private letter ruling from the IRS with respect to the Distribution and the Merger and instead are relying solely on their respective tax opinions for comfort that the Distribution and the Merger qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Code. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete, or any undertaking to be fully complied with, could affect the validity of the tax opinions and result in tax liabilities for our shareholders and/or us.\nA putative class action lawsuit relating to the BSS Transaction has been filed against us, DISH Network, Mr. Ergen and certain of our officers.\nOn July 2, 2019, a complaint was filed by purported EchoStar stockholders. See Note 19 in our Accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about litigation related to the BSS Transaction.\nAn adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may be more susceptible to adverse events as a result of the BSS Transaction.\nWe have divested the BSS Business and our business will be subject to increased concentration of risks that affect our retained businesses. We are now a smaller, less diversified and more narrowly focused business, which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions.\nWe might not be able to engage in certain strategic transactions because we have agreed to certain restrictions to comply with U.S. federal income tax requirements for a tax-free spin-off.\nTo preserve the intended tax treatment of the Distribution, we have agreed to comply with certain restrictions under current U.S. federal income tax laws for spin-offs. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and/or harm our business, financial results and operations. If these restrictions, among others, are not followed, the Distribution could be taxable to us and possibly our stockholders.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OWNERSHIP\nWe are controlled by one principal stockholder who is our Chairman.\nCharles W. Ergen, our Chairman, beneficially owns approximately 54% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of the Class B common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Ergen into Class A common stock and giving effect to the exercise of options held by Mr. Ergen that are either currently exercisable as of, or may become exercisable within 60 days after, February 11, 2021) and beneficially owns approximately 92% of the total voting power of all classes of shares (assuming no conversion of any Class B common stock and giving effect to the exercise of options held by Mr. Ergen that are either currently exercisable as of, or may become exercisable within 60 days after, February 11, 2021). Through his beneficial ownership of our equity securities, Mr. Ergen has the ability to elect a majority of our directors and to control all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. As a result of Mr. Ergen\u2019s voting power, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in the NASDAQ listing rules and, therefore, are not subject to NASDAQ requirements that would otherwise require us to have (i) a majority of independent directors; (ii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; (iv) a compensation committee charter which provides the compensation committee with the authority and funding to retain compensation consultants and other advisors; and/or (v) director nominees selected, or recommended for the Board\u2019s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors.\nWe have potential conflicts of interest with DISH Network due to our common ownership.\nQuestions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between DISH Network and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. Areas in which conflicts of interest between DISH Network and us could arise include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Cross directorships and stock ownership. Charles W. Ergen serves as the Chairman of our and DISH\u2019s board of directors, is employed by both companies and has fiduciary duties to our and DISH\u2019s shareholders. Mr. Ergen may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company. For example, there is potential for a conflict of interest when we or DISH Network look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for both companies. In addition, some of our directors and officers, including Mr. Ergen, own DISH stock and options to purchase DISH stock. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company and DISH Network.\n\u2022Intercompany agreements with DISH Network. We have entered into various agreements with DISH Network. Pursuant to certain agreements, we obtain certain products, services and rights from DISH Network; DISH Network obtains certain products, services and rights from us; and we and DISH Network indemnify each other against certain liabilities arising from our respective businesses. Generally, the amounts paid for products and services provided under the agreements are based on cost plus a fixed margin, which varies depending on the nature of the products and services provided. Certain other intercompany agreements cover matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by DISH Network for certain of our businesses. We have also entered into certain commercial agreements with DISH Network. The terms of certain of these agreements were established while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH and were not the result of arm\u2019s length negotiations. The allocation of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations between DISH Network and us under certain agreements with DISH Network may not necessarily reflect what two unaffiliated parties might have agreed to. Had these agreements been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties, their terms may have been more or less favorable to us. In addition, DISH Network or its affiliates will likely continue to enter into transactions, including joint ventures, acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic initiatives and transactions, with us or other affiliates. Although the terms of any such transactions will be established based upon negotiations between us and DISH Network and, when appropriate, subject to approval by a committee of non-interlocking directors or in certain instances non-interlocking management, there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries or affiliates as may otherwise be obtained in negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.\n\u2022Competition for business opportunities. DISH Network may have interests in various companies that have subsidiaries or controlled affiliates that own or operate domestic or foreign services that may compete with services offered by our businesses. We may also compete with DISH Network when we participate in auctions for spectrum or orbital slots for our satellites or other business opportunities. In other auctions, we and DISH Network may be prohibited from participating separately, and cooperating with DISH Network may result in a less favorable outcome for us.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts of interest with DISH Network and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nWe do not have any agreements not to compete with DISH Network. However, many of our potential customers who compete with DISH Network have historically perceived us as a competitor due to our affiliation with DISH Network. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into any commercial relationships with potential customers who are competitors of DISH Network (particularly if we continue to be perceived as affiliated with DISH Network as a result of common ownership, certain shared management services and other arrangements with DISH Network).\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders, because of our capital structure and certain provisions of the BSS Transaction.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022a capital structure with multiple classes of common stock: a Class A that entitles the holders to one vote per share; a Class B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share; a Class C that entitles the holders to one vote per share, except upon a change in control of our company in which case the holders of Class C are entitled to ten votes per share; and a non-voting Class D;\n\u2022a provision that authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022a provision limiting who may call special meetings of shareholders; and\n\u2022a provision establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.\nAs discussed above, Mr. Ergen beneficially owns approximately 54% of our total equity securities and approximately 92% of the total voting power of all classes of shares and such ownership may make it impractical for any third party to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, pursuant to our articles of incorporation we have a significant amount of authorized and unissued stock that would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nAdditionally, in order to preserve the intended tax treatment of the Distribution, we have agreed to comply with certain restrictions under current U.S. federal income tax laws for spin-offs, including, refraining from engaging in certain transactions that would result in a fifty percent or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership. This restriction could discourage third parties from seeking to acquire us.\nGENERAL RISKS\nOur articles of incorporation designate the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County of the State of Nevada as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nAny person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our articles of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring certain claims, including claims against our directors, officers or employees, in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable and therefore the choice of forum provision may discourage lawsuits or increase costs with respect to such claims.\nWe may face other risks described from time to time in periodic and current reports we file with the SEC.", "PERMNO": 92469, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "SATS"}
