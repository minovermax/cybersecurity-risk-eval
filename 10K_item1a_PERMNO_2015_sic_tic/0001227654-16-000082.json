{"cik": "1227654", "company": "COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and all of the information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur mining, manufacturing and distribution operations are subject to a variety of risks and hazards, which may not be covered by insurance.\nThe process of mining, manufacturing and distribution involves risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, labor disputes, unusual or unexpected geological conditions, or acts of nature. Our rock salt mines and SOP production facilities are located near bodies of water and industrial operations. These risks and hazards could lead to uncontrolled water intrusion or flooding or other events or circumstances, which could result in the complete loss of a mine or could otherwise result in damage or impairment to, or destruction of, mineral properties and production facilities, environmental damage, delays in mining and business interruption, and could result in personal injury or death. Our products are converted into finished goods inventories of salt and plant nutrition products and are stored in various locations throughout North America and the U.K. These inventories may become impaired either through accidents or obsolescence.\nOur salt mines located in Cote Blanche, Louisiana, and Goderich, Ontario, Canada, constitute approximately 74% of our total salt production capacity. These underground salt mines supply most of the salt product necessary to support our North American highway deicing product line and significant portions of our consumer and industrial salt products. Although sales of our deicing products and profitability of the salt segment can vary from year to year partially due to weather variations in our markets, over the last three years sales of our highway deicing products have averaged approximately 45% of our consolidated sales. An extended production interruption or catastrophic event at either of these facilities could result in an inability to have product available for sale or to fulfill our highway deicing sales contracts and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAlthough we evaluate our risks and carry insurance policies to mitigate the risk of loss where economically feasible, not all of these risks are reasonably insurable, and our insurance coverage contains limits, deductibles and exclusions. We cannot assure you that our coverage will be sufficient to meet our needs in the event of loss. Such a loss may have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2015 FORM 10-K\nOur operations are dependent on our rights and ability to mine our properties and having renewed or received the required permits and approvals from third parties and governmental authorities.\nWe hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a third party or a governmental agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Certain organizations have challenged the Canadian government's ownership of the land under which our Goderich, Ontario, facility is operated. There can be no assurances that existing permits or the Canadian government's ownership will be upheld.\nFurthermore, many of our facilities are located on land leased from governmental authorities. Our leases generally require us to continue mining in order to retain the lease, the loss of which could adversely affect our ability to mine the associated reserves. In addition, our facilities are located near existing and proposed third-party industrial operations that could affect our ability to fully extract, or the manner in which we extract the mineral deposits to which we have mining rights.\nWe are currently seeking to expand our solar-evaporation-pond acreage at the Great Salt Lake, which may require additional water and other rights from governmental authorities. There can be no assurance that we will be granted the necessary rights for all or any portion of these undeveloped lands nor, if received, that the lands will be developed to produce marketable product.\nIn some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. We do not believe any action will be taken to suspend these accesses or easements. However, no assurance can be made that a third party will not take any action to suspend the access or easement, nor that any such action would not be materially adverse to our results of operations or financial condition.\nNew technology may reduce the demand for our products or result in new or less costly methods of competitors producing products, either of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe demand for our products may be adversely affected by advances in technology or development of competing products. More efficient application methods for salt and plant nutrition products may reduce demand. New application methods as well as any future technological advances may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. New methods of delivering plant nutrient products could increase competition and impact the demand for our products. Methods of producing sodium chloride, magnesium chloride and SOP in large quantities have historically been characterized by slow pace of technological advances for existing competitors or potential new entrants. New methods or alternative sources developed to produce sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, SOP or competing products could increase competition and impact the demand for our products, thereby impacting our results of operations.\nIncreasing costs or a lack of availability of transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver products at competitive prices.\nTransportation and handling costs are a significant component of the total delivered cost of product sales, particularly salt. The high relative cost of transportation tends to favor producers located nearest the customer. We contract bulk shipping vessels, barges, trucking and rail services to move salt from our production facilities to distribution outlets and customers. In many instances, we have committed to deliver salt, under penalty of non-performance, up to nine months prior to producing and delivering the salt for delivery to our customers. A reduction in the dependability or availability of transportation services or a significant increase in transportation service rates, including the impact of weather and water levels on the waterways we use, could impair our ability to deliver our products economically to our customers and impair our ability to expand our markets.\nIn addition, diesel fuel is a significant component of transportation costs we incur to deliver our products to customers. In limited circumstances, our arrangements with customers allow for full or partial recovery of changes in diesel fuel costs through an adjustment to the selling price. However, a significant increase in the price of diesel fuel that is not recovered through transportation costs we charge our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAgricultural economics, customer expectations about future plant nutrition market prices and availability, and customer application rates can have a significant effect on the demand for our plant nutrition products, which can affect our sales volumes and prices.\nWhen customers anticipate increased plant nutrient selling prices or improving agricultural economics, they may accumulate inventories in advance, which may result in a delay in the realization of price increases for our products. In addition, customers may delay their purchases when they anticipate future plant nutrient selling prices may remain constant or decline, or when they anticipate declining agricultural economics, which may adversely affect our sales volumes and selling prices. Customer expectations about the availability of plant nutrition products can have similar effects on sales volumes and prices.\nGrowers are continually seeking to maximize their economic return, which may impact the application rates for plant nutrition products. Growers\u2019 decisions regarding the application rate for plant nutrition products, including whether to forgo application altogether, may vary based on many factors, including crop and plant nutrient prices and nutrient levels in the soil. Growers are more likely to increase application rates when crop prices are relatively high or when plant nutrient prices and soil nutrient levels\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2015 FORM 10-K\nare relatively low. Growers are more likely to reduce application rates or forgo application of plant nutrition products when crop prices are relatively low and when plant nutrient prices and soil nutrient levels are relatively high. This variability can materially impact our sales prices and volumes.\nEconomic conditions in the agriculture sector, and supply and demand imbalances for competing plant nutrient products, can also impact the price of, or demand for, our products.\nMOP is the least expensive form of potash fertilizer based on the concentration of potassium oxide and, consequently, it is the most widely used potassium source for most crops. SOP is utilized by growers for many high-value crops, especially crops for which low-chloride content fertilizers and/or the presence of sulfur improves quality and yield. Economic conditions for agricultural products can affect the type and amount of crops grown as well as the type or amount of fertilizer product used. Potash is a commodity, and consequently it trades in a highly competitive market affected by global supply and demand. When the demand and price of potash are high, competitors are more likely to increase their production. Competitors may also expand their future production capacity of potash or new facilities may also be built by new market participants, both of which could impact available supplies. An over-supply of either type of potash product domestically or worldwide could unfavorably impact the sales prices we can charge for our specialty potash fertilizer, as a large price disparity between potash products could cause growers to choose a less-expensive alternative.\nThe seasonal demand for our products and the variations in our operations from quarter to quarter due to weather conditions, including any effects from climate changes, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nOur deicing product line is seasonal, with operating results varying from quarter to quarter as a result of weather conditions and other factors. On average, over the last three years, approximately two-thirds of our deicing product sales occurred during November through March each year when winter weather was most severe. Winter weather events are not predictable outside of a relatively short time frame either locally or on a broader scale, yet we must stand ready to deliver deicing products to local communities with little advance notice under the requirements of our highway deicing contracts. As a result, we attempt to stockpile sufficient supplies of highway deicing salt in the last three fiscal quarters to meet estimated demand for the winter season. Failure to deliver under our highway deicing contracts may result in significant penalties.\nIn addition, winter weather events may be influenced by climate change, weather cycles and other natural events. Any prolonged change in weather patterns in our relevant geographic markets could impact demand for our deicing products. Weather conditions that impact our highway deicing product line include temperature, amounts of wintry precipitation, number of snowfall events and the potential for, and duration and timing of, snowfall or icy conditions in our relevant geographic markets. Lower than expected sales during the winter season could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nOur plant nutrition operating results are dependent in part upon conditions in the agriculture sector. The fertilizer business, including our Protassium+ and micronutrient businesses, can be affected by a number of factors, including weather patterns, crop prices, field conditions (particularly during periods of traditionally high crop nutrients application) and quantities of crop nutrients imported to and exported from North America. Our ability to produce Protassium+ from our solar evaporation ponds is dependent upon sufficient lake brine levels and hot, arid summer weather conditions. Extended periods of precipitation or a prolonged lack of sunshine or cooler weather during the evaporation season would hinder the evaporation rate and hence our production levels, which may result in lower sales volumes and higher unit production costs.\nAdditionally, our ability to harvest minerals could be negatively impacted by any prolonged change in weather patterns, including any effects from climate change, leading to changes in mountain snowfall fresh water run-off that significantly impact lake levels or by increased rainfall during the summer months at our solar evaporation ponds at the Great Salt Lake. A cooler and/or wet evaporation season could also impact the harvest of minerals at the Great Salt Lake and result in an increase in our per-unit production costs. Similar factors can negatively impact the lake level and concentration of sulfates at the Big Quill Lake, thereby impacting the production at our Wynyard facility and the resulting per-unit production costs.\nIf our computer systems and information technology are compromised, our ability to conduct our business will be adversely impacted.\nWe rely on computer systems and information technology to conduct our business, including cash management, order entry, vendor payments, employee salaries and recordkeeping, inventory and asset management, shipping of products, and communication with employees and customers. We also use our systems to analyze and communicate our operating results and other data to internal and external recipients. In 2016, we expect to implement a comprehensive update to our enterprise resource planning system. Any implementation issues could be costly to resolve and have adverse effects on our ability to properly capture, process and report financial transactions. While we have taken steps to ensure the security of our information technology systems, we may be susceptible to cyber attacks, computer viruses and other technological disruptions. A material failure or interruption of access to our computer systems for an extended period of time or the loss of confidential or proprietary data could adversely affect our operations and regulatory compliance. While we have mitigation and data recovery plans in place, it is possible that significant\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2015 FORM 10-K\ncapital investment and time may be required to correct any of these issues. The additional capital investment needed to prevent or correct any of these issues may negatively impact our business and cash flows.\nIf we cannot successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements, we may experience significant increases in the cost of labor or a disruption in our operations.\nLabor costs, including benefits, represented approximately 30% of our total production costs in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,984 employees, of which 1,003 are located in the U.S., 806 in Canada and 175 in the U.K. Approximately 30% of our U.S. workforce and 50% of our global workforce is represented by labor unions. Of our 12 material collective bargaining agreements, three will expire in 2016, four will expire in 2017, four will expire in 2018 and one will expire in 2019.\nApproximately 10% of our workforce is employed in Europe where trade union membership is common. Although we believe that our employee relations are good, they can be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, political and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations.\nOur business is capital-intensive, and the inability to fund necessary capital expenditures in order to develop or expand our operations could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability.\nWe have begun to expand our SOP processing plant at our Great Salt Lake facility which requires us to make significant capital expenditures in 2016. In addition, we have shaft relining and continuous mining projects at our Goderich mine, which will require significant capital expenditures over the next several years. Capital expenditures required for projects we have undertaken may increase due to factors beyond our control. Although we currently finance most of our capital expenditures through cash provided by operations, we also may depend on the availability of credit to fund future capital expenditures. We could have difficulty finding or obtaining the financing required to fund our capital expenditures, which could limit our expansion ability or increase our debt service requirements; the occurrence of either could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and profitability.\nIn addition, our credit agreement contains restrictive covenants related to financial metrics. We may pursue other financing arrangements, including leasing transactions as a method of financing our capital needs. If we are unable to obtain suitable financing, we may not be able to complete our expansion plans. A failure to complete our expansion plans could negatively impact our growth and profitability.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to maintain our existing facilities and the amount of capital expenditures to maintain these facilities can fluctuate significantly when a large replacement or other need is required to maintain operations. These activities may require the temporary suspension of production at portions of our facilities, which could adversely affect our cash flows and profitability. For our solar pond operations, we may need to obtain regulatory approvals to complete these maintenance activities, and there can be no assurance that such approvals will be received. If these approvals are not received, the impact on our operations may be material.\nOur business is dependent upon highly-skilled personnel, and the loss of key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe success of our business is dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled managers and other personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the efficient operation of our business. The loss of the services of key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could lead to higher labor costs or the use of less-qualified personnel. We do not currently maintain \"key person\" life insurance on any of our key employees.\nCompetition in our markets and governmental policies and regulations could limit our ability to attract and retain customers, force us to continuously make capital investments, alter supply levels, and put pressure on the prices we can charge for our products.\nWe encounter competition in all areas of our business. Some of our competitors are privately-held companies. Therefore, information about these companies may be difficult to obtain, which may hinder us competitively. Competition in our product lines is based on a number of considerations, including product quality and performance, transportation costs (especially in salt distribution), brand reputation, price, and quality of customer service and support. Many of our customers attempt to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to increase their efficiency. Our customers increasingly demand a broad product range, and we must continue to develop our expertise in order to manufacture and market these products successfully. To remain competitive, we will need to invest continuously in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position. We may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive. Additionally, a portion of our plant nutrition business is dependent upon international sales, which accounted for approximately 9% of plant nutrition sales volumes in 2015. At times, we face global competition from other SOP and potash producers, and new competitors may enter the markets in which we sell at any time. We may face more competition in periods when the foreign currency exchange rates versus the dollar are favorable\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2015 FORM 10-K\nfor our competitors. A relatively strong U.S. dollar increases the attractiveness of the U.S. market for our international competitors. Changes in potash competitors\u2019 production or marketing focus could have a material impact on our business. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nOur production processes rely on the consumption of natural gas, electricity and certain raw materials. A significant interruption in the supply or an increase in the price of any of these products could adversely affect our business.\nEnergy costs, primarily natural gas and electricity, represented approximately 8% of our total production costs in 2015. Natural gas is a primary fuel source used in the evaporated salt production process. Our profitability is impacted by the price and availability of natural gas we purchase from third parties. We have a policy of hedging natural gas prices through the use of futures forward swap contracts. We have not entered into any contracts beyond three years for the purchase of natural gas. Our contractual arrangements for the supply of natural gas do not specify quantities and are automatically renewed annually unless either party elects not to do so. We do not have arrangements in place with back-up suppliers. In addition, potential climate change regulations or other carbon or emissions taxes could result in higher production costs for energy, which may be passed on to us, in whole or in part. A significant increase in the price of energy that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our products or covered through our hedging arrangements, or an extended interruption in the supply of natural gas or electricity to our production facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use KCl as a raw material feedstock in our SOP production process at our Wynyard facility, and it also may be used to supplement our solar harvest at our Ogden facility. We also use KCl as an additive to some of our consumer deicing products and to sell for water conditioning applications. KCl for our Wynyard facility is purchased at prices that have been substantially below market pricing under a long-term supply agreement. We purchased and consumed potassium mineral feedstock for SOP production over the last several years and may supplement our pond-based SOP production when it is economically feasible to do so. In addition, we have continued to purchase KCl for certain water conditioning and consumer deicing applications. Large positive or negative price fluctuations can occur without a corresponding change in sales price to our customers. This could change the profitability of these products, which could materially affect our results of operations and cash flows. This could reduce the amount of blended deicing and water conditioning products we produce, which could also adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur tax liabilities are based on existing tax laws in our relevant tax jurisdictions and include estimates. Changes in tax laws or estimates, including the impact of tax audits, could adversely impact our profitability, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe Company files U.S., Canadian, U.K. and Brazilian tax returns with federal and local taxing jurisdictions. Developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our potential tax exposure items requires significant judgment and assumptions as well as a thorough knowledge of the tax laws in various jurisdictions. We are subject to audit by various taxing authorities, and we may be assessed additional taxes during an audit. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits, including any appeals, in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that the actual outcomes of these audits or appeals will approximate our estimates, and the outcomes could have a material impact on our net earnings or financial condition. Our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S.\nCanadian provincial tax authorities have challenged tax positions claimed by one of the Company\u2019s Canadian subsidiaries and have issued tax reassessments for years 2002-2010. The reassessments are a result of ongoing audits and total approximately $77.7 million, including interest through December 2015. The Company disputes these reassessments and plans to continue to work with the appropriate authorities in Canada to resolve the dispute. There is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate resolution of this dispute, and any related disputes for other open tax years, may be materially higher or lower than the amounts the Company has reserved for such disputes. In connection with this dispute, local regulations require the Company to post security with the tax authority until the dispute is resolved. The Company has posted collateral in the form of a $49.2 million performance bond. The Company has paid approximately $27.3 million, most of which is recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, with the remaining balance to be paid after 2015.\nIn addition, Canadian federal and provincial taxing authorities have reassessed the Company for years 2004-2006, which have been previously settled by agreement among the Company, the Canadian federal taxing authority and the U.S. federal taxing authority. The Company has fully complied with the agreement since entering into it and believes this action is highly unusual. The Company is seeking to enforce the agreement which provided the basis upon which the returns were previously filed and settled. The total amount of the reassessments, including penalties and interest through December 31, 2015, related to this matter totals approximately $87.1 million. The Company has posted collateral in the form of an approximately $19.3 million performance bond and $34.7 million in the form of a bank letter guarantee which is necessary to proceed with future appeals or litigation.\nThe Company received Canadian income tax reassessments for years 2007-2008. The total amount of the reassessments, including penalties and interest through December 31, 2015, related to this matter is approximately $30.8 million. The Company does not agree with these adjustments and is receiving assistance from the tax jurisdictions for relief from the impact of double\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2015 FORM 10-K\ntaxation as available in the tax treaty between the U.S. and Canada. The Company has filed protective Notices of Objection and has agreed to post collateral of an approximately $8.6 million performance bond and $9.4 million in the form of a bank letter guarantee which is necessary to proceed with future appeals or litigation. Although the outcome of examinations by taxing authorities is uncertain, the Company believes it has adequately reserved for this matter.\nWhile these matters involve an element of uncertainty, management expects that their ultimate outcome will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. However, we can provide no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters, and the impact could be material if they are not resolved in our favor.\nWe have been able to manage our cash flows generated and used across the Company to permanently reinvest earnings in our foreign jurisdictions or efficiently repatriate those funds to the U.S. The amount of permanently reinvested earnings is influenced by, among other things, the profits generated by our foreign subsidiaries and the amount of investment in those same subsidiaries. The profits generated by our domestic and foreign subsidiaries are, to some extent, impacted by values charged on the transfer of our products between them. We calculate values charged on transfer based on guidelines established by a multi-national organization which publishes accepted tax guidelines recognized in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and those calculated values are the basis upon which our subsidiary profits and cash flows are recorded, including estimates involving income taxes. Such calculations, however, involve significant judgment and estimates by the Company\u2019s management. Some of our calculations have been approved by taxing authorities for certain periods, while the values for those same periods or different periods have been challenged by the same or other taxing authorities. While we believe our calculations and estimates are proper and consistent with the accepted guidelines, the values constitute estimates for which there can be no guarantee that the final resolution with all of the relevant taxing authorities will be consistent with our existing calculations and resulting financial statement estimates. Additionally, the timing for settling these challenges may not occur for many years. It is possible the resolution could impact the amount of earnings attributable to our domestic and foreign subsidiaries, which could impact the amount of permanently reinvested earnings and the tax-efficient access in all jurisdictions to consolidated cash on hand or future cash flows from operations and our ability to pay dividends and service our debt.\nEconomic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business, including economic loss, and have a negative impact on earnings.\nSince we produce and sell our products primarily in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total sales, were 24% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nexchange controls;\n\u2022\ntariffs, other trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\nrequirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments, or acquire new businesses in these jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements.\nFluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, especially the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling or Brazilian Real, may adversely affect our results of operations. Because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, the translation into U.S. dollars of sales or earnings can result in a significant increase or decrease in the reported amount of those sales or earnings. In addition, our debt service requirements are primarily in U.S. dollars even though a significant percentage of our cash flow is generated in Canadian dollars and British pounds sterling. Significant changes in the value of Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling and Brazilian Reals relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on U.S. dollar-denominated debt.\nIn addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risk when we or one of our subsidiaries enter into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks. It is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We have experienced and expect to experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings from time to time as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. See \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2015 FORM 10-K\nand Results of Operations - Effects of Currency Fluctuations and Inflation,\" and \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nOur overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our success in differing economic and political conditions. We cannot assure you that we will continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business.\nThe Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations with which we must comply in order to operate our business and obtain contracts with governmental entities.\nOur highway deicing customers principally consist of municipalities, counties, states, provinces and other governmental entities in North America and the U.K. This product line represented approximately 47% of our annual sales in 2015. We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations administered by federal, state, local and foreign governments relating to, but not limited to, the production, transporting and storing of our products, as well as the commercial activities conducted by our employees and our agents. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could preclude us from conducting business with governmental agencies and lead to penalties, injunctions, civil remedies or fines.\nEnvironmental laws and regulation may subject us to significant liability and could require us to incur additional costs in the future.\nWe are subject to numerous business, environmental and health and safety laws, and regulations in the countries in which we do business. They include laws and regulations relating to land reclamation and remediation of hazardous substance releases, and discharges to soil, air and water with which we must comply to effectively operate our business. Environmental laws and regulations with which we currently comply may become more stringent and could require material expenditures for continued compliance. Environmental remediation laws, such as CERCLA, impose liability, without regard to fault or to the legality of a party\u2019s conduct, on certain categories of persons (known as \"potentially responsible parties\" or \"PRPs\") who are considered to have contributed to the release of \"hazardous substances\" into the environment. Although we are not currently incurring material liabilities pursuant to CERCLA, in the future we may incur material liabilities under CERCLA and other environmental cleanup laws, with regard to our current or former facilities, adjacent or nearby third-party facilities, or off-site disposal locations. Under CERCLA, or its various state analogues, one party may, under some circumstances, be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. Liability under these laws involves inherent uncertainties. Violations of environmental, health and safety laws are subject to civil, and in some cases, criminal sanctions.\nIn the past, we have received notices from governmental agencies that we may be a PRP at certain sites under CERCLA or other environmental cleanup laws. In some cases, we have entered into \"de minimis\" settlement agreements with the U.S. governmental agencies with respect to certain CERCLA sites, pursuant to which we have made one-time cash payments and received statutory protection from future claims arising from those sites. At other sites for which we have received notice of potential CERCLA liability, we have provided information to the EPA that we believe demonstrates that we are not liable and the EPA has not asserted claims against us with respect to such sites. In some instances, we have agreed, pursuant to consent orders or agreements with the appropriate governmental agencies, to undertake investigations, which currently are in progress, to determine whether remedial action may be required to address such contamination. At other locations, we have entered into consent orders or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies to perform remedial activities that will address identified site conditions.\nAt present, we are not aware of any sites for which we expect to receive a notice from the EPA of potential CERCLA liability that would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, based on past operations, we may receive such notices in the future for issues at sites of which we are currently unaware. We currently do not expect our known environmental liabilities and site conditions, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse impact on our financial position. However, material expenditures could be required in the future to remediate the contamination at these or at other current or former sites.\nWe have also developed alternative mine uses. For example, we sold an excavated portion of our salt mine in the U.K. to a subsidiary of Veolia, a business with operations in the waste management industry. That business is permitted by the jurisdictional environmental agency to securely dispose of certain stable types of hazardous waste in the area of the salt mine owned by them for which they pay us fees. We believe that the mine is stable and provides a secure disposal location separate from our mining and records management operations. However, we recognize that any temporary or permanent storage of hazardous waste may involve risks to the environment. Although we believe that we have taken these risks into account during our planning process, and Veolia is required by U.K. statute to maintain adequate security for any potential closure obligation, it is possible that material expenditures could be required in the future to further reduce this risk or to remediate any future contamination.\nContinued government and public emphasis on environmental issues, including climate change, can be expected to result in increased future investments for environmental controls at ongoing operations, which would be charged against income from future operations. The U.S. has announced that reporting requirements for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and federal climate change legislation is possible in the future in the U.S., while Canada has already committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Future environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations may require substantial capital expenditures\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2015 FORM 10-K\nand may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see Item 1, \"Business - Environmental, Health and Safety Matters.\"\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Compass Minerals had $727.0 million of outstanding indebtedness, consisting of $250.0 million of senior notes (\"4.875% Senior Notes\") and approximately $477.0 million of borrowings under a senior secured term loan. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022\nwe may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nit may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy;\n\u2022\nit may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes; and\n\u2022\nit may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition, if we are unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, as needed.\nAlthough our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries, none of our subsidiaries are obligated to make funds available to CMI for payment on our 4.875% Senior Notes or to pay dividends on our capital stock. Accordingly, CMI\u2019s ability to make payments on our 4.875% Senior Notes and distribute dividends to our stockholders is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries to CMI, and our compliance with the terms of our senior secured credit facilities, including the total leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio. We cannot assure you that we will remain in compliance with these ratios, nor can we assure you that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide CMI with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund scheduled interest and principal payments on the 4.875% Senior Notes, when due. If we consummate an acquisition, including any potential acquisition of the remaining ownership of Produqu\u00edmica, our debt service requirements could increase. Furthermore, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nAn increase in interest rates would have an adverse effect on our interest expense under our senior secured credit facilities. Additionally, the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies or may require accelerated payments on our debt.\nWe pay variable interest on our senior secured credit facilities based on either the Eurodollar rate or the alternate base rate. Significant increases in interest rates will adversely affect our cost of debt.\nOur senior secured credit facilities and indebtedness limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase or redeem our stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ngrant liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell assets; and\n\u2022\nacquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies.\nOur senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain financial ratios. These financial ratios include an interest coverage ratio and a total leverage ratio. Although we have historically been able to maintain these financial ratios, we may not be able to maintain these ratios in the future. Covenants in our senior secured credit facilities may also impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to enter into acquisitions or joint ventures or engage in other favorable business activities.\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2015 FORM 10-K\nIf we default under our senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could require immediate payment of the entire principal amount. A default includes nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts when due; a change of control; default under agreements governing our other indebtedness in which the principal amount exceeds $30 million; material judgments in excess of $30 million; failure to provide timely audited financial statements; or inaccuracy of representations and warranties. Any default under our senior secured credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of principal payments under our other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities were to require immediate repayment, we would need to obtain new borrowings to be able to repay them immediately, or we could not repay our other indebtedness, which may also become immediately due. We may be able to obtain new borrowings to finance these accelerated payment requirements, however there can be no assurance that such borrowings could be obtained at terms which are acceptable to us. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control.\nThe acquisition of the remaining ownership of Produqu\u00edmica by early 2019 at the latest is part of our long-term strategic plan. The timing of the completion of our acquisition or our inability or failure to complete the acquisition could impact our financial performance.\nIn December 2015, we completed the acquisition of a 35% equity stake in Produqu\u00edmica, a Brazilian corporation, for approximately $114.1 million U.S. dollars at closing. Produqu\u00edmica is one of Brazil\u2019s leading manufacturers and distributors of specialty plant nutrients. The investment includes a path to full ownership by early 2019 at the latest. The majority shareholders have a put option that may be exercised in October of 2016, 2017, or 2018 to sell the remaining stake in Produqu\u00edmica. The funding and closing of the acquisition would occur early the following year, subject to regulatory review. We also have a call option that is exercisable in October 2018. The option exercise price is based on full-year adjusted EBITDA at a multiple of 9.4x (2016), 9.3x (2017) or 9.2x (2018). Currently, we estimate that the cost to purchase the remaining equity in Produqu\u00edmica would be approximately $230 to $250 million U.S. dollars, based upon their projected performance and exchange rates. The occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that would result in the termination or delay of our acquisition of the remaining Produqu\u00edmica ownership stake by early 2019 at the latest, including our inability to complete the acquisition due to our failure or the failure of Produqu\u00edmica or its majority shareholders to satisfy any of the conditions to closing, could impact our ability to achieve our long-term strategic goals. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to complete the acquisition, including any failure to complete the acquisition due to a failure to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we cannot successfully integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited and our financial condition adversely affected.\nOur business strategy includes supplementing internal growth with acquisitions of complementary businesses. We may be unable to identify suitable businesses to acquire. We compete with other potential buyers for complementary businesses. Competition and regulatory considerations may result in fewer acquisition opportunities. If we cannot complete acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected. Completion of acquisitions, including our plan for full ownership of Produqu\u00edmica by early 2019 at the latest, could disrupt the plans, financial condition and performance of our business, Produqu\u00edmica or both.\nThe information we obtain about an acquisition target may be limited, and we cannot assure you that an acquisition will perform as expected or positively impact our financial performance. Additionally, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses. Any potential acquisition, including the acquisition of full ownership of Produqu\u00edmica by early 2019, involves risk, including the ability to effectively integrate the acquired technologies, operations and personnel into our existing business; the diversion of capital and management\u2019s attention from other areas of the business; and the impact of debt obligations resulting from acquisitions.\nOur intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets, to be a valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights primarily through a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret protection. Our patents, which vary in duration, may not preclude others from selling competitive products or using similar production processes. We cannot provide assurances that pending applications for protection of our intellectual property rights will be approved. Our trademark registrations may not prevent our competitors from using similar brand names. We also rely on trade secret protection to guard confidential unpatented technology, and when appropriate, we require that employees and third-party consultants or advisors enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. It is possible that our competitors could independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology.\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2015 FORM 10-K\nMany of our important brand names are registered as trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries. The laws in certain foreign countries in which we do business do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States law. As a result, these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products, services and brands in foreign jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe cannot guarantee that our intellectual property rights would be upheld if challenged. Such claims, if proven, could materially and adversely affect our business and may lead to the impairment of the amounts recorded for goodwill and other intangible assets. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we may lose any competitive advantage provided by our intellectual property. In addition, although any such claims may ultimately prove to be without merit, the necessary management attention to and legal costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could be significant.\nWe may be restricted from paying cash dividends on our common stock in the future.\nWe currently declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, earnings, legal requirements, restrictions in our debt agreements, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. The terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit regular annual dividends to $80 million plus 50% of the preceding year net income, as defined, and may restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock if our total leverage ratio exceeds 4.50x (actual ratio of 2.3x as of December 31, 2015) or if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the credit facilities. We cannot assure you that the agreements governing our current and future indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facilities, will permit us to pay dividends on our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89952, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "CMP"}
