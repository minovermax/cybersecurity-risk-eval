Risk Factors\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes. Please also see \u201cCautionary Notes Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nSummary of Principal Risk Factors\nThe following risks and uncertainties are among the most significant we face. However, the risks and uncertainties identified in this subsection are not the only ones we face, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to all of the risk factors described in Item 1A.\nGeneral Risks Related to Our Business\n\u2022Our business is dependent upon the continued adoption of TCAR by hospitals and physicians.\n\u2022Adoption of TCAR depends upon positive clinical data and medical society recommendations, and negative clinical data or medical society recommendations would adversely affect our business.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and the spread of new variants continue to negatively impact our business and operations.\n\u2022We are experiencing inflationary pressures, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, which could increase our manufacturing costs and operating expenses and have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.\n\u2022If we are not able to maintain adequate levels of third-party coverage and reimbursement for the procedures using our products, if third parties rescind or modify their coverage, or if patients are left with significant out-of-pocket costs, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We rely on Cordis, to supply the ENROUTE stent, and if Cordis fails to supply the ENROUTE stent in sufficient quantities or at all, it will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We depend on a limited number of single source suppliers to manufacture our components, sub-assemblies and materials, including Cordis, which makes us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We have a history of net losses, we expect to incur operating losses in the future and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\n\u2022The failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, and other obligations could adversely affect our business.\nIntellectual Property Risks\n\u2022We may become a party to intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell and market our products.\n\u2022Our success will depend on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights.\n\u2022We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nRegulatory Risks\n\u2022Our products have in the past and could in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation or increase the probability of inspection by, or additional scrutiny from, the FDA or other relevant regulatory bodies.\n\u2022Changes in the CMS fee schedules may harm our revenue and operating results.\n\u2022If we fail to comply with broad based healthcare and other governmental regulations, we could face substantial fines and penalties and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\u2022If we fail to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for our products, or if clearances or approvals for future products and indications are delayed or not issued, our commercial operations would be harmed.\n\u2022Our clinical trials may fail to demonstrate competent and reliable evidence of the safety and effectiveness of our products, which would prevent or delay commercialization of our products in development.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of net losses, we expect to incur operating losses in the future and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception in March 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $49.8 million, and we expect to continue to incur additional losses in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $288.7 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and from sales of our portfolio of TCAR products that enable transcarotid artery revascularization. The losses and accumulated deficit have primarily been due to the substantial investments we have made to develop our products, as well as for costs related to general research and development, including clinical and regulatory initiatives to obtain marketing approval, sales and marketing efforts, investments in manufacturing and distribution capacity, and other infrastructure improvements.\nOver the next several years, we expect to continue to devote a substantial amount of our resources to increase adoption of TCAR using our products, expand commercialization efforts in the United States and select international markets, improve and expand reimbursement for TCAR, expand the labeled indications for our products, conduct clinical studies, and develop additional products. In addition, as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, director & officer liability insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, all of which continue to increase. Accordingly, we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability. Our failure to achieve and sustain profitability in the future will make it more difficult to finance our business and accomplish our strategic objectives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, failure of our products to significantly penetrate the target markets would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on, and currently sell products to enable, TCAR, which is our only product offering.\nTo date, all of our revenue has been derived, and we expect it to continue to be derived in the near term, from sales of our products that enable TCAR. TCAR is a relatively new treatment option for certain patients diagnosed with carotid artery disease and, as a result, physician awareness of TCAR and our products, and experience with TCAR and our products, is limited. A number of factors that are outside of our control may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results, including:\n\u2022Physician experience and hospital demand for our products and the extent of adoption of TCAR, including the rate at which physicians recommend our products and TCAR to their patients;\n\u2022Delays in, or failure to supply product, component and material deliveries by our third-party suppliers;\n\u2022Positive or negative media coverage, or public, patient and/or physician perception, of our products and TCAR or competing products and procedures;\n\u2022Any safety or effectiveness concerns that arise regarding our products or TCAR;\n\u2022Unanticipated delays in product development or product launches;\n\u2022Our ability to maintain our current or obtain further regulatory clearances or approvals; and\n\u2022Introduction of new products or procedures for treating carotid artery disease that compete with our products and the TCAR procedure.\nIt is therefore difficult to predict our future financial performance and growth, and such forecasts are inherently limited and subject to a number of uncertainties. If our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties we face, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change due to circumstances in our business or our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nIn addition, because we devote substantially all of our resources to our products that enable TCAR and rely on our products and the adoption of TCAR as our sole source of revenue, any factors that negatively impact our products or TCAR, or result in a decrease in sales of products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon the continued adoption of TCAR by hospitals and physicians.\nOur future growth and profitability largely depends on our ability to increase physician awareness and adoption of TCAR and on the willingness of physicians to recommend the procedure to more of their patients. Physicians may not use our products unless they are able to determine, based on experience, clinical data, medical society recommendations and other analyses, that our products provide a safe and effective treatment alternative for carotid artery disease. Even if we are able to raise awareness and increase adoption of TCAR among physicians, physicians tend to be slow in changing their medical treatment practices and may be hesitant to select our products or TCAR for recommendation to patients for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022Long-standing relationships with competing companies and distributors that sell other products, such as stents and embolic protection devices for transfemoral carotid artery stenting, or CAS;\n\u2022Competitive response and negative selling efforts from providers of alternative carotid revascularization products;\n\u2022Perceived liability risk generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n\u2022Lack or perceived lack of sufficient clinical evidence, including long-term data, supporting clinical benefits;\n\u2022Reluctance to change to or use new products and procedures; and\n\u2022Time commitment and skill development that may be required to gain familiarity and proficiency with TCAR and our products.\nPhysicians play a significant role in determining the course of a patient\u2019s treatment for carotid artery disease and, as a result, the type of treatment that will be recommended or provided to a patient. We focus our sales, marketing and education efforts primarily on vascular surgeons, and aim to educate referring physicians such as cardiologists, radiologists, neurologists, and general practitioners regarding the patient population that would benefit from TCAR. However, we cannot assure you that we will achieve broad education or market acceptance among these practitioners. For example, if diagnosing physicians who serve as the primary point of contact for patients are not made aware of TCAR, they may not refer patients to physicians for treatment using our products, and those patients may instead not seek treatment at all or may be treated with alternative procedures. In addition, some physicians may choose to utilize TCAR on only a subset of their total patient population or may not adopt TCAR at all. If a physician experiences an adverse event in one or more of their TCAR patients or elects to convert TCAR to CEA mid-procedure, they may not continue offering and performing TCAR at the same rate or at all. Further, as TCAR is a new procedure, it may not fit into the workstreams of certain physicians. If we are not able to effectively demonstrate that TCAR is beneficial in a broad range of patients, adoption of TCAR will be limited and may not occur as rapidly as we anticipate, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that TCAR or our products will achieve broad market acceptance among hospitals and physicians. Any failure of TCAR or our products to satisfy demand or to achieve meaningful market acceptance and penetration will harm our future prospects and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the medical device industry\u2019s relationship with physicians is under increasing scrutiny by the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, the Department of Justice, or DOJ, state attorneys general, and other foreign and domestic government agencies. Our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations governing our\nrelationships with physicians, or an investigation into our compliance by the OIG, DOJ, state attorneys general or other government agencies, could significantly harm our business.\nIn most cases, before physicians can use our products for the first time, our products must be approved for use by a hospital's new product or value analysis committee, or the staff of a hospital or health system. Following such approval, we may be required to enter into a purchase contract. Such approvals or requirements to enter into a purchase contract could deter or delay the use of our products by physicians. We cannot provide assurance that our efforts to obtain such approvals, enter into purchase contracts, or generate adoption will be successful or increase the use of our products, and if we are not successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdoption of TCAR depends upon positive clinical data and medical society recommendations, and negative clinical data or medical society recommendations would adversely affect our business.\nThe rate of adoption of TCAR and sales of our products that facilitate the procedure is heavily influenced by clinical data. Although the Society for Vascular Surgery\u2019s Vascular Quality Initiative contains real world data retrospectively comparing carotid revascularization procedures including TCAR, we have not conducted head-to-head clinical trials to prospectively compare TCAR to the procedures historically available to patients, such as CEA or CAS, which may limit the adoption of TCAR. Additionally, the Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis 2, or CREST-2, clinical trial currently funded by the National Institutes of Health, is ongoing and is designed to compare the effectiveness of each of CEA and CAS with best medical management solutions in standard surgical risk asymptomatic patients with carotid artery disease. Although we estimate that enrollment will not be completed until sometime after 2026, interim results have been released from time to time. At the completion of the four-year follow-up, the trial could conclude that medical management alone achieves the same therapeutic results as CEA and/or CAS, which could have an adverse impact on the adoption of TCAR. Finally, our competitors and third parties may also conduct clinical trials of our products without our participation. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or third parties, the interpretation of our or other clinical data or findings of new or more frequent adverse events, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs physicians are influenced by guidelines issued by physician organizations, such as the Society for Vascular Surgery, the rate of adoption of TCAR and sales of our products that facilitate the procedure are also influenced by medical society recommendations. We believe the Society for Vascular Surgery\u2019s Clinical Practice Guidelines, or SVS Guidelines, are of importance to the broader market acceptance of TCAR. The revised SVS Guidelines on the management of carotid artery disease were published in June 2021. Like previous versions of the guidelines, it generally discusses CAS and embolic protection methods, including flow reversal. The 2021 edition does state that TCAR is preferred over CEA and CAS in anatomically or physiologically high surgical risk patients, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. If subsequent versions of the SVS Guidelines do not recommend TCAR, or if the Society for Vascular Surgery issues a negative or more limited statement regarding TCAR, physicians may not adopt or continue to use TCAR or our products at the same rate or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if key opinion leaders who currently support TCAR cease to recommend TCAR or our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAdoption of TCAR depends upon appropriate physician training, and inadequate training may lead to negative patient outcomes, affect adoption of TCAR and adversely affect our business.\nThe success of TCAR depends in part on the skill of the physician performing the procedure and on our customers\u2019 adherence to appropriate patient selection and proper techniques provided in training sessions conducted by our training faculty. For example, we train our customers to ensure correct use of our ENROUTE NPS and proper deployment of our ENROUTE stent. However, physicians rely on their previous medical training and experience when performing TCAR, and we cannot guarantee that all such physicians will have the necessary surgical and endovascular skills to perform the procedure. While we mandate physician attendance at our TCAR training program or training with proctors, we do not control which physicians perform TCAR or how much training they receive. Physicians who have not completed our training sessions may nonetheless attempt to perform TCAR. If physicians perform TCAR in a manner that is inconsistent with its labeled indications, with components that are not our products or without adhering to or completing our training sessions, their patient outcomes may not be consistent with the outcomes achieved in our and other clinical trials, studies or registries of TCAR. This result may negatively impact the perception of patient benefit and safety and limit adoption of TCAR and our products that facilitate the procedure, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, hospitals and physician organizations may adopt physician credentialing guidelines requiring TCAR training that is more extensive than our training program. If physicians conclude that we do not provide adequate TCAR training, they may be less likely to adopt TCAR and our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the spread of new variants continue to negatively impact our business and operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and its variants, or COVID-19, in the United States has continued to result in intermittent travel restrictions and restrictive hospital policies impacting our sales professionals and therapy development specialists who support them. New virus variants, including the Delta and Omicron variants, and increased infection and related hospitalization rates throughout the pandemic have increased the volatility and uncertainty in the number of TCAR procedures and demand for our products. Our field-based team continues to be available to support TCAR procedures, either in person or virtually. Members of our field team may, however, choose not to enter hospitals due to preexisting conditions, personal choice, or on doctors\u2019 orders or may be unable to enter hospitals due to hospital policy. In addition, hospitals have and continue to experience staffing shortages that cause problems scheduling or rescheduling TCAR procedures. Physicians or their patients may postpone TCAR procedures in response to COVID-19 or divert resources to treat patients with COVID-19 or other conditions deemed higher priority. Some hospitals have also restricted or limited access for non-patients, including our sales professionals and therapy development specialists, which has negatively impacted our access to physicians and their staff. Our business and operations may be impacted by competition for operating room and hybrid operating rooms within hospitals that have dedicated certain resources only to COVID-19 patients. As hospitals cancel and defer elective surgeries, it reduces their revenue and impacts their financial results, which could result in pricing pressure on our products as they seek cost savings. Prolonged restrictions relating to COVID-19 could adversely affect our procedures and the revenue we derive as a result. Additionally, some hospitals may have cash flow problems or cease doing business due to the impact of COVID-19 on their operations, which could reduce the number of hospitals where TCAR is performed and adversely affect our ability to collect amounts due to us and our revenue as a result.\nWe expect these challenges to continue to impact the number of TCAR procedures for the foreseeable future, with procedure volumes impacted by increased COVID-19 hospitalizations and hospital capacity and staffing constraints due to recent COVID-19 variants. Patients may also be reluctant to visit their physicians at their offices or in hospitals due to fear of contracting COVID-19. Physicians may not be performing as many diagnostic tests for their patients and the labs where these tests are performed may not be open, staffed adequately or open the entire day. Even where physicians continue to treat symptomatic patients, treatment of asymptomatic patients is being deferred in many cases in areas where COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are significant. The reduction in diagnostic testing and physician visits, the increase in deferred treatment, and patient behaviors are translating into fewer than expected TCAR procedures being performed in the current environment.\nGovernmental mandates related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases have impacted, and we expect them to continue to impact, our personnel and personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, and the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt our supply chain and/or reduce our margins. An extended implementation of governmental mandates could impact our ability to operate effectively and conduct ongoing manufacturing or research and development activities. However, we are considered an essential business under applicable state rules and our manufacturing operations are ongoing. If key personnel or large groups of our employees contract the virus, that may also impact our business and operations. In the meantime, we have taken steps to provide for our employees, including providing the ability for employees to work remotely and implementing strategies to support a safe work environment for onsite employees. In addition, we have required our employees to get the COVID-19 vaccine. We are also assessing our business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic. We have implemented distancing policies and protocols established to continue manufacturing and other operations.\nThe outbreak and persistence of COVID-19 in international markets that we have targeted for our international expansion has delayed preparation for and launch of such expansion efforts. Regulatory timelines for approval in some countries have been delayed. Finally, we anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact clinical and regulatory matters. COVID-19 is delaying enrollment in clinical trials across the medical device industry and may affect any new trials we decide to pursue. Additionally, we may experience regulatory delays in our effort to seek a label expansion for the ENROUTE stent in standard surgical risk patients, as the FDA has from time to time diverted resources to address the impact of COVID-19. COVID-19 may cause disruptions that could have a material adverse impact on our clinical trial plans and timelines, including:\n\u2022Delays in receiving authorizations from local regulatory authorities, ethics committees and institutional review boards to initiate planned clinical trials;\n\u2022Delays or difficulties in enrolling or follow up visits for patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022Delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022Delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials, including interruptions in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials;\n\u2022Changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\u2022Diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022Interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others, or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the integrity of clinical trial data;\n\u2022Risk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will acquire COVID-19 while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events;\n\u2022Delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other third parties and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u2022Limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; and\n\u2022Refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies.\nAny of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the delay or denial of regulatory approvals or clearances of our product.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 or mitigate the burden on hospitals, and the speed with which normal economic, labor market and operating conditions resume, among others.\nCOVID-19 has created global supply chain constraints and constrained labor markets, which could result in the inability of our suppliers to deliver components, sub-assemblies and materials to us on a timely basis or at all.\nWe are concerned about ensuring an adequate supply of the components, sub-assemblies and materials that are used to manufacture our TCAR products as well as to support our research and development activities for new products. For example, certain liners and shrink tubing used in both the ENROUTE stent and ENROUTE NPS are in short supply and delivery of these materials are likely to be delayed, which could result in manufacturing delays for our TCAR products. If there were a shortage of supply, the cost of components, sub-assemblies and materials may increase or we may need to pay a premium to obtain sufficient supply, either of which could harm our ability to provide our products on a cost-effective basis or at all or we may experience delays in providing our TCAR products to our customers. We also may experience delays in and increased costs for our research and development programs and clinical trials due to the inability to obtain the necessary materials to advance these programs and trials. In connection with any supply shortages, reliable and cost-effective replacement sources may not be available on short notice or at all, and this may force us to increase prices and face a corresponding decrease in demand for our TCAR products, or force us to absorb these increased costs. In the event that any of our suppliers were to discontinue production of our key product components, sub-assemblies or the materials used in our TCAR products, developing alternate sources of supply for these items would be time consuming, difficult and costly. If we were to experience a supply shortage with our components, sub-assemblies and the materials necessary to manufacture our TCAR products our reputation in the market, demand for our TCAR products and our operating results may be significantly and adversely affected and new products may be delayed.\nWe are experiencing inflationary pressures, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, which could increase our manufacturing costs and operating expenses and have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.\nWe continuously monitor the effects of inflationary factors, such as increases in our cost of goods sold and selling and operating expenses, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Specifically, we are experiencing inflationary pressure affecting the cost of the components for our TCAR products and in the wages that we pay our employees due to\nchallenging labor market conditions. Competitive and regulatory conditions restrict our ability to fully recover, such as increased costs through price increases, higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases. As a result, we are unlikely to be able to pass these increased costs along to our customers or fully offset the impact of persistent inflation. Our inability or failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cause us to need to obtain additional capital earlier than anticipated.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products and manage our inventory.\nWe seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in order to protect ourselves from supply interruptions, but keep limited components, sub-assemblies, materials and finished products on hand. To ensure adequate inventory supply and manage our operations with our manufacturing partners and suppliers, we forecast anticipated materials requirements and demand for our products in order to predict inventory needs and then place orders with our suppliers based on these predictions. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products would be negatively affected by many factors, including our rapid growth, product recalls, pandemics, failure to accurately manage our expansion strategy, product introductions by competitors, an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products, our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new products, changes to hospital capacity, staffing, procedure and protocol changes, unanticipated changes in general market conditions or regulatory matters and weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions.\nInventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in a portion of our inventory becoming obsolete or expiring, as well as inventory write-downs or write-offs. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products or our own requirements for components, sub-assemblies and materials, our manufacturing partners and suppliers may not be able to deliver components, sub-assemblies and materials to meet our requirements and our manufacturing may be affected by the impact of COVID-19 on our suppliers. We have increased our inventory on hand in reaction to global supply chain constraints, but these inventory levels may prove to be inadequate. If we do not have adequate supply of components, sub-assemblies and materials there may be interruptions, delays or cancellations of deliveries of our TCAR products to our customers, any of which would damage our reputation, customer relationships and business. In addition, several components, sub-assemblies and materials incorporated into our products require lengthy order lead times, and additional supplies or materials may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or our manufacturing partners, or at all, and our manufacturing partners and suppliers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity in order to meet our increased requirements, any of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for our products and our results of operations.\nWe have limited long-term data regarding the safety and effectiveness of our products, including our ENROUTE stent and TCAR generally.\nOur products enable TCAR, which is a relatively new procedure, and our success depends on acceptance of our products and TCAR by the medical industry, including physicians and hospitals. The FDA reviews our products for safety and effectiveness, prior to commercial launch of these products. Thereafter, physicians, through their own use of the products and evaluation of clinical data, make their own decisions as to whether our products are safe and effective for their patients and improve their clinical outcomes. Important factors upon which the effectiveness of our products, including our ENROUTE stent, will be measured include but are not limited to long-term data regarding the risk of stroke and death and the rates of restenosis and reintervention following TCAR. The long-term clinical benefits of procedures that use our products are not fully known. Any late failure of our stent that results in a negative clinical outcome or need for reintervention could deter physicians from adopting our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe results of short-term clinical experience of our products do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefit. We believe that physicians will compare the rates of long-term risk of stroke and death, as well as restenosis and reintervention for procedures using our products, against alternative procedures, such as CEA and CAS. If the long-term data do not meet physicians\u2019 expectations, or if long-term data indicate that our products are not as safe or effective as other treatment options or as current short-term data would suggest, our products may not become widely adopted, physicians may recommend alternative treatments for their patients and our business could be harmed.\nIf we are not able to maintain adequate levels of third-party coverage and reimbursement for the procedures using our products, if third parties rescind or modify their coverage, or if patients are left with significant out-of-pocket costs, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTCAR is currently covered under certain circumstances for certain patients by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under a National Coverage Determination, and has been covered by some commercial payers, independent networks and other entities not governed by the National Coverage Determination. In the United States, we derive our revenue from sales to hospitals and medical centers, which typically bill all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with our products to various third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans\u2019 Administration, private commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare-related organizations, and then bill patients for any applicable deductibles or co-payments. For example, our contracts are with the hospitals and medical centers that purchase our products for use with TCAR and not with the commercial payers. As a result, access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products by third-party payers is essential to the acceptance of our products by our customers.\nHowever, in the United States, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services among third-party payers, so coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer, and each coverage decision and level of reimbursement is independent. As a result, third-party reimbursement may not be available or adequate for our products, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain our current levels of coverage or reimbursement or be able to expand coverage to other insurance carriers. Further, payers continually review new technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny or limit coverage for products and procedures or delay coverage approval until further clinical data are available. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained, or maintained if obtained. If third-party reimbursement is not available or adequate for TCAR procedures using our products, or if there is any decline in the amount that payers are willing to reimburse our customers for TCAR, new customers may not adopt, or may reduce their rate of adoption of, our products and we could experience additional pricing pressure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProducts for carotid stenting including our TCAR products are covered for Medicare beneficiaries under a National Coverage Determination, or NCD, for Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty. Coverage for non-Medicare patients depend upon commercial and other payer policies. Based on reimbursement information regarding CEA and CAS, we estimate that approximately 79% of carotid procedures are reimbursed by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and the remaining approximately 21% are reimbursed by commercial and other payers. Medicare is managed by CMS, which make the final determination regarding Medicare hospital and physician coverage and payment. Any future reconsideration of the applicable Medicare NCD may result in expansion of coverage of carotid stenting procedures including TCAR based on FDA-approved indications or continued coverage limitations to CMS approved CAS investigational studies. CMS reimburses hospital inpatient services based on Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups, or MS-DRGs. All CAS, TCAR and CEA procedures are currently paid only as Medicare inpatient procedures. CMS policy focus on hospital price transparency, site (e.g. inpatient, outpatient, ambulatory surgery center and office) neutral payments and MS-DRG refinements may place additional downward pressure on future hospital inpatient payments. Medicare payments to physicians are based on a Resource Based Relative Value System. CMS policy changes to increase reimbursement for physician primary care services may result in reductions to physician payments for specialty services and procedures. As a result of any reductions in payments to hospitals and physicians for TCAR procedures, TCAR utilization may decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, patients may elect to reduce or defer out-of-pocket costs during times of economic uncertainty or periods of legislative change. If hospital, physician and/or patient demand for TCAR, and thus our products that facilitate the procedure, are adversely affected by third-party reimbursement policies and decisions, it will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInternationally, reimbursement systems in foreign markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In certain international markets, a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Additionally, many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for products and procedures. In most markets there are both private insurance systems and government-managed systems. If sufficient levels of coverage and reimbursement are not available for TCAR or our current or future products, in either the United States or internationally, the demand for our products and our revenues will be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, when payers combine their operations, the combined company may elect to reimburse for TCAR at the lowest rate paid by any of the participants in the consolidation or use its increased size to negotiate reduced rates. If one of the payers participating in the consolidation does not reimburse for TCAR at all, the combined company may elect not to reimburse for TCAR, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property license from Cordis, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a license agreement with Cordis, under which Cordis has granted us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license, without the right to sublicense, to certain of its intellectual property related to the PRECISE\u00ae carotid stent for transcervical treatment of carotid artery disease with an intravascular stent for certain applications for accessing blood vessels through the neck and cervical area. In August 2021, Cardinal Health divested Cordis to private equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC. Our license agreement with Cordis imposes, and we expect that any future license agreements will impose, certain diligence, royalty, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors, including Cordis, may have the right to reduce the scope of our rights or terminate these agreements, in which event we may not be able to develop and market any product that is covered by these agreements. If not extended, this license will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of all applicable Cordis patents - in certain countries, for example, our rights are expected to expire within the next few years. Termination of this license for failure to comply with such obligations or for other reasons, or reduction, elimination or expiration of our licensed rights under it or any other license or agreement, may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses on less favorable terms or our not having sufficient intellectual property rights to operate our business or cause us to enter into new licenses for different stents. The occurrence of such events could materially harm our business and financial condition.\nThe risks described elsewhere pertaining to our intellectual property rights also apply to the intellectual property rights that we in-license, and any failure by us or our licensors, including Cordis, to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce these rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. In some cases we do not have control over the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the patents that we license, and may not have sufficient ability to provide input into the patent prosecution, maintenance and defense process with respect to such patents, and our licensors may fail to take the steps that we believe are necessary or desirable in order to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce the licensed patents.\nWe rely on Cordis to supply the ENROUTE stent, and if Cordis fails to supply the ENROUTE stent in sufficient quantities or at all, it will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on Cordis to manufacture the ENROUTE stent pursuant to a supply agreement between us and Cordis Corporation. We strive to maintain an inventory of several months\u2019 worth of ENROUTE stents to guard against potential shortfalls in supply, and we estimate that it would take one to two years to find an alternative supplier for our ENROUTE stent and multiple years to identify and seek approval for another stent, and in each case qualify it for use with our other products. In addition, Cordis currently manufactures the ENROUTE stent at a facility in Juarez, Mexico. This facility has previously and in the future could become subject to a COVID-19 outbreak which would cause Cordis to temporarily shut down manufacturing operations, which would in turn present risk to the ongoing supply of our stents used in TCAR procedures. If Cordis's ability to manufacture the ENROUTE stent is interrupted as a result, or if Cordis experiences a product recall or breaches its supply agreement with us, we may not have a sufficient number of stents for delivery to support TCAR procedures. Finally, if not extended, our supply agreement with Cordis will terminate when our license agreement with Cordis terminates and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to negotiate or enter into a new supply agreement with Cordis on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We or Cordis may wish to re-evaluate certain aspects of the supply agreement we have with Cordis which may lead to lengthy or costly negotiations and affect our ability to obtain the ENROUTE stent at an acceptable price or at all. Any shortfall in the supply of ENROUTE stents may result in lower adoption rates for TCAR, fewer TCAR procedures being performed generally, and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTCAR involves surgical risks and is contraindicated in certain patients, which may limit adoption.\nRisks of TCAR using our products include the risks that are common to surgical and endovascular procedures, including perforation, dissection, embolization, bleeding, infection, nerve injury and restenosis. Endovascular procedures occurring in the carotid arteries also include the additional risks of stroke, heart attack and death. We are aware of certain characteristics and features of TCAR that may prevent widespread market adoption, including the fact that physicians would need to adopt a new procedure, and that training for physicians will be required to enable them to effectively operate our products.\nOur current products are contraindicated, and therefore should not be used, in certain patients. Our ENROUTE NPS is contraindicated in patients in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated; patients with uncorrected bleeding disorders; patients with severe disease of the ipsilateral common carotid artery; and patients with uncontrollable intolerance to flow reversal. Our ENROUTE stent is contraindicated in patients in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated; patients in whom the ENROUTE NPS is unable to be placed; patients with uncorrected bleeding disorders; patients with known allergies to nitinol; and patients with lesions in the ostium of the common carotid artery. Our ENHANCE peripheral access kit is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected obstruction in the vessel. Our ENROUTE guidewire is contraindicated in patients judged not acceptable for percutaneous\nintervention. Additionally, patients that lack at least five centimeters of common carotid artery free of significant disease are not indicated for our ENROUTE NPS.\nWe face manufacturing risks that could adversely affect our ability to manufacture products and could reduce our gross margins and negatively affect our business and operating results.\nOur business strategy depends on our ability to manufacture, and our contract manufacturers ability to manufacture, our current and future products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis to meet customer demand, while adhering to product quality standards, complying with regulatory quality system requirements and managing manufacturing costs. We have a facility located in Sunnyvale, California, where we currently assemble and package certain of our products, and inspect, release and ship all of our products, either directly to our customers or to our facility in Plymouth, Minnesota. We currently produce our ENROUTE NPS at our Sunnyvale facility, and we and the contract manufacturers of our other products do not currently have redundant facilities although we expect to begin manufacturing of our ENROUTE NPS at our Plymouth facility in the second half of 2022. If our or our manufacturing partners\u2019 facilities suffers damage, or a force majeure event, this could materially impact our ability to operate.\nWe are also subject to numerous other risks relating to our manufacturing capabilities, including:\n\u2022Quality and reliability of components, sub-assemblies and materials that we source from third-party suppliers, who are required to meet our quality specifications, the majority of which are our single source suppliers for the products they supply;\n\u2022Our or our manufacturing partners\u2019 inability to secure components, sub-assemblies and materials in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022Our or our manufacturing partners\u2019 inability to maintain compliance with quality system requirements or pass regulatory quality inspections;\n\u2022Our or our manufacturing partners\u2019 failure to develop products in a timely manner or to required specifications or to increase production capacity or volumes to meet demand;\n\u2022Our or our manufacturing partners\u2019 inability to design or modify production processes to enable us to produce future products efficiently or implement changes in current products in response to design or regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022Difficulty identifying and qualifying, and obtaining new regulatory approvals, for alternative suppliers for components in a timely manner.\nAs demand for our products increases, we will have to invest additional resources to purchase components, sub-assemblies and materials, hire and train employees and enhance our manufacturing processes. If we or our manufacturing partners fail to increase our production capacity efficiently, we may not be able to fill customer orders on a timely basis, our sales may not increase in line with our expectations and our operating margins could fluctuate or decline. In addition, although we expect some of our products in development to share product features, components, sub-assemblies and materials with our existing products, the manufacture of these products may require modification of our or our manufacturing partners\u2019 current production processes or unique production processes, the hiring of specialized employees, the identification of new suppliers for specific components, sub-assemblies and materials or the development of new manufacturing technologies. It may not be possible for us or our manufacturing partners\u2019 to manufacture these products at a cost or in quantities sufficient to make these products commercially viable or to maintain current operating margins, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of single source suppliers to manufacture our components, sub-assemblies and provide other materials, which makes us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on single source suppliers for the components, sub-assemblies and materials for our products, such as our ENROUTE stent and for the key components, sub-assemblies and materials for our ENROUTE NPS. These components, sub-assemblies and materials are critical and there are relatively few alternative sources of supply. We have not qualified or obtained necessary regulatory approvals for additional suppliers for most of these components, sub-assemblies and materials, and we do not carry a significant inventory for some of these items. While we believe that alternative sources of supply may be available, we cannot be certain whether they will be available if and when we need them, or that any alternative suppliers would be able to provide the quantity and quality of components and materials that we would need to manufacture our products if our existing suppliers were unable to satisfy our supply requirements. To utilize other supply sources, we would need to identify and qualify new suppliers to our quality standards and obtain any\nadditional regulatory approvals required to change suppliers, which could result in manufacturing delays and increase our expenses. Our manufacturing partners rely on single source suppliers as well, and are subject to the foregoing risks.\nOur and our manufacturing partners\u2019 dependence on third-party suppliers subjects us to a number of risks that could impact our ability to manufacture our products and harm our business, including:\n\u2022Interruption of supply resulting from modifications to, or discontinuation of, a supplier\u2019s operations;\n\u2022Delays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues or a supplier\u2019s failure to produce components that consistently meet our quality specifications;\n\u2022Price fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers for key components;\n\u2022Inability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms due to global supply chain constraints or other factors;\n\u2022Difficulty identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers for components in a timely manner;\n\u2022Inability of suppliers to comply with applicable provisions of the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR or other applicable laws or regulations enforced by the FDA and other state and applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022Inability to adequately ensure the quality of products and components manufactured by third parties;\n\u2022Production delays related to the evaluation and testing of products and components from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications;\n\u2022Delays in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers; and\n\u2022An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the ongoing threat of new COVID-19 variants, particularly as it may impact our supply chain.\nAlthough we require our third-party suppliers to supply us with components that meet our specifications and comply with applicable provisions of the QSR and other applicable legal and regulatory requirements in our agreements and contracts, and we perform incoming inspection, testing or other acceptance activities to ensure the components meet our requirements, there is a risk that our suppliers will not always act consistent with our best interests, and may not always supply components that meet our requirements or supply components in a timely manner. For example, in the first quarter of 2021, we announced the voluntary recall of certain lots of our ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent System, manufactured by Cordis. Our decision to recall these lots was based on complaints we received about tips detaching from the stent delivery system as well as internal testing that we conducted. We have determined the root cause of the detachment was a single operator at Cordis, who, over a specific timeframe, produced lots in which a small number of units were not reliably manufactured to specification. Recalls like this one could cause the supply of our TCAR products to customers to be interrupted, us to incur additional expenses, have to purchase replacement products, negative publicity or damage to our reputation, any of which could cause our results of operations to be adversely impacted.\nOur quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations, including our revenue, net income or net loss and cash flow, may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly and annual financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Fluctuations in quarterly and annual results may decrease the value of our common stock. Because our quarterly results may fluctuate, period-to-period comparisons may not be the best indication of the underlying results of our business and should only be relied upon as one factor in determining how our business is performing.\nWe have a limited total addressable market based on our current labeling restrictions.\nThe total addressable market for TCAR is limited by a number of factors. Approximately 169,000 patients with carotid artery disease in the United States received treatment in the form of surgical or endovascular intervention in 2021. Of this group, we estimate that approximately one-third would be outside the scope of the FDA-approved labeling for the ENROUTE stent, as those patients are not deemed to be at high risk for adverse events from CEA, or high surgical risk. Although we have submitted a PMA supplement to the FDA to expand the labeling for the ENROUTE stent to treat\npatients at standard risk for adverse events from CEA, the current FDA-approved labeling for the ENROUTE stent is limited to patients at high risk for adverse events from CEA. Patients at high risk for adverse events from CEA are defined as having significant comorbidities and/or anatomic risk factors, and/or advanced age, that would make them riskier candidates for CEA. Furthermore, the safety and effectiveness of certain products for TCAR has not been established for certain patients. For example, the FDA-cleared labeling for the ENROUTE NPS states that patients should have at least five centimeters of common carotid artery free of significant disease for initial access to the artery and positioning of the ENROUTE sheath. In addition, per the FDA-approved labeling for the ENROUTE stent, TCAR is limited to asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis of at least 80% and symptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis of at least 50%, both of which must also be high surgical risk. In addition, physicians may choose to perform CEA in patients with certain anatomical characteristics, including heavily calcified carotid arteries, calcified lesions and severe vessel tortuosity. Finally, current labeling for our products includes contraindications for certain patients, thus further reducing our total addressable market.\nExpanding the addressable market for TCAR is dependent upon labeling and reimbursement expansion initiatives.\nThe ENROUTE stent is not currently indicated for use in standard surgical risk patients. To access a larger portion of the market for carotid artery disease, we have filed a PMA supplement and will need to obtain approval by the FDA for a label expansion of the ENROUTE stent in standard surgical risk patients and obtain corresponding reimbursement coverage expansion for TCAR with CMS. As a condition of PMA approval, the FDA may require additional post-market data from clinical studies or registries, which we are preparing for. However, there are no guarantees that we will be able to obtain such FDA approval or CMS label expansion for the ENROUTE stent, or that any label expansion or additional reimbursement coverage will be sufficient to adequately access the standard risk portion of the market for carotid artery disease patients. If we are unable to obtain labeling and reimbursement coverage expansion, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in public health insurance coverage and government reimbursement rates for the TCAR procedures using our products could affect the adoption of our products and our future revenue.\nThe federal government is considering ways to change, and has changed, the manner in which healthcare services are paid for in the United States. Individual states may also enact legislation that impacts Medicaid payments to hospitals and physicians. In addition, CMS establishes Medicare payment levels for hospitals and physicians on an annual basis, which can increase or decrease payment to such entities. Internationally, medical reimbursement systems vary significantly from country to country, with some countries limiting medical centers\u2019 spending through fixed budgets, regardless of levels of patient treatment, and other countries requiring application for, and approval of, government or third-party reimbursement. Even if we succeed in bringing our products to market in additional foreign countries, uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy, legislation and regulation, as well as private market practices, could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at acceptable prices.\nCost-containment efforts of our customers, purchasing groups and governmental organizations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nIn an effort to reduce costs, many hospitals in the United States have become members of Group Purchasing Organizations, or GPOs, and Integrated Delivery Networks, or IDNs. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with medical device companies and distributors and then offer these negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. GPOs and IDNs typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. Bids are generally solicited from multiple providers with the intention of driving down pricing or reducing the number of vendors. Due to the highly competitive nature of the GPO and IDN contracting processes, we may not be able to obtain new, or maintain existing, contract positions with major GPOs and IDNs. Furthermore, the increasing leverage of organized buying groups reduces market prices for our products and/or require administrative fees, thereby reducing our revenue and/or margins.\nWhile having a contract with a GPO or IDN for a given product category can facilitate sales to members of that GPO or IDN, such contract positions can offer no assurance that any level of sales will be achieved, as sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders. Even when a provider is the sole contracted supplier of a GPO or IDN for a certain product category, members of the GPO or IDN are generally free to purchase from other suppliers. Furthermore, GPO and IDN contracts typically are terminable without cause by the GPO or IDN upon 60 to 90 days\u2019 notice. Accordingly, the members of such groups may choose to purchase alternative products due to the price or quality offered by other companies, which could result in a decline in our revenue.\nWe may not be able to achieve or maintain satisfactory pricing and margins for our products.\nManufacturers of medical devices have a history of price competition, and we can give no assurance that we will be able to achieve satisfactory prices for our products or maintain prices at the levels we have historically achieved. Any decline in the amount that payers reimburse our customers for TCAR could make it difficult for customers to continue using, or to adopt, our products and could create additional pricing pressure for us. If we are forced to lower the price we charge for our products, our gross margins will decrease, which will adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business. If we are unable to maintain our prices, or if our costs increase and we are unable to offset such increase with an increase in our prices, our margins could erode. We will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressure, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nIf our manufacturing facility becomes damaged or inoperable, or if we are required to vacate a facility, we may be unable to produce the products we manufacture or we may experience delays in production or an increase in costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently maintain our manufacturing and a portion of our research and development and non-field-based sales, general and administrative operations in a building located in Sunnyvale, California, which is situated on or near earthquake fault lines, and we do not yet have redundant manufacturing although we expect to begin manufacturing of our ENROUTE NPS at our Plymouth facility in the second half of 2022. Should our building be significantly damaged or destroyed by natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, fires or other events, it could take months to relocate or rebuild, during which time our employees may seek other positions, our research, development and manufacturing would cease or be delayed and our products may be unavailable. Moreover, the use of a new facility or new manufacturing, quality control, or environmental control equipment or systems generally requires FDA review and, with respect to certain products, approval of a PMA supplement. Because of the time required to authorize manufacturing in a new facility under FDA, the State of California and non-U.S. regulatory requirements, we may not be able to resume production on a timely basis even if we are able to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity. While we maintain property and business interruption insurance, such insurance has limits and would only cover the cost of rebuilding and relocating and lost revenue, but not general damage, losses caused by earthquakes, losses we may suffer due to our products being replaced by competitors\u2019 products or loss in value due to associated decreases in our stock price. The inability to perform our research, development and manufacturing activities, combined with our limited inventory of materials and components and manufactured products, may cause physicians to discontinue using our products or harm our reputation, and we may be unable to reestablish relationships with such physicians in the future. Consequently, a catastrophic event at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the current lease for our Sunnyvale, California manufacturing facility expires in 2024, and our operations are growing at a pace that may require us to find a replacement or expansion facility in California sooner. We may be unable to renew our lease or find a new facility on commercially reasonable terms. If we were unable or unwilling to renew at the proposed rates, relocating our manufacturing facility would involve significant expense in connection with the movement and installation of key manufacturing equipment and any necessary recertification with regulatory bodies, and we cannot assure investors that such a move would not delay or otherwise adversely affect our manufacturing activities or operating results. If our manufacturing capabilities were impaired by our move, we may not be able to manufacture and ship our products in a timely manner, which would adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, we rely on our manufacturing partners to supply certain of our products, and our partners are subject to similar risks with respect to their facilities. If our manufacturing partners\u2019 facilities are damaged or destroyed and their ability to supply products to us is limited, it could negatively affect our reputation, physician relationships and TCAR adoption, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Several of our products are sterilized at a particular third party facility, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to or closure of one or more of such facilities, we may be unable to sterilize such products at the previous levels or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a sterilization facility, a third party may not be available on a timely basis to replace capacity in the event sterilization capacity is lost.\nIf we fail in our training initiatives, to increase our sales and marketing capabilities or to develop broad brand awareness, our growth will be impeded and our business will suffer.\nWe currently rely on our direct sales force to sell our products in targeted geographic regions in the U.S., and any failure to maintain and grow our direct sales force could harm our business. The members of our direct sales force are highly trained and possess substantial technical and clinical expertise, which we believe is critical in driving adoption of TCAR. The members of our U.S. sales force are at-will employees. The loss of these personnel to competitors, or otherwise, could materially harm our business. If we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical and clinical expertise and qualifications, or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical and clinical expertise in replacement personnel, our revenues and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nIn order to generate future growth, we plan to continue to expand and leverage our sales, marketing, and medical affairs infrastructure to increase our trained physician and hospital customer base and our business. Identifying and recruiting qualified sales, marketing and medical affairs personnel and training them on TCAR, on applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and on our internal policies and procedures requires significant time, expense and attention. It often takes several months or more before a sales representative is fully trained and productive. Our business may be harmed if our efforts to expand and train our sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue, and our higher fixed costs may slow our ability to reduce costs in the face of a sudden decline in demand for our products. Any failure to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or timely reduce fixed costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our medical affairs department may not train physicians at a rate sufficient to expand our physician base in a manner consistent with our business plan. Our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing efforts. We plan to dedicate significant resources to our marketing programs. Our business may be harmed if our marketing efforts and expenditures do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. In addition, we believe that developing and maintaining broad awareness of our brand is critical to achieving broad acceptance of our products and penetrating new accounts. Brand promotion activities may not generate patient or physician awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the costs and expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote, maintain and protect our brand, we may fail to attract or retain the physician acceptance necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand building efforts, or to achieve the level of brand awareness that is critical for broad adoption of our products.\nThe market for our products is highly competitive. If our competitors are able to develop or market carotid artery disease treatments that are safer, more effective or gain greater acceptance in the marketplace, than any products we develop, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nOur industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. We are initially positioning TCAR as an alternative to CEA and CAS in high surgical risk patients. CEA has historically been performed by vascular surgeons as the primary surgical solution for carotid artery disease. The major manufacturers of products, such as patches and shunts, used in connection with CEA include LeMaitre Vascular, Getinge / Maquet, Baxter, Terumo, Gore and Edwards. Some competitors market products for use in CAS, such as peripheral access kits, stents, distal and proximal embolic protection devices, guidewires, balloons and sheaths. Such companies include Abbott, Boston Scientific, Cordis, Medtronic, Terumo, Gore, Contego Medical and InspireMD. These technologies, other products that are in ongoing clinical trials, new drugs or additional indications for existing drugs could demonstrate better safety, effectiveness, clinical results, lower costs or greater physician and patient acceptance.\nWe compete, or may compete in the future, against other companies which have longer operating histories, more established products and greater resources, which may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration or improved operating results. These companies enjoy several competitive advantages, including:\n\u2022Greater financial and human capital resources;\n\u2022Significantly greater name recognition;\n\u2022Established relationships with vascular surgeons and other treating specialties, referring physicians, customers and third-party payers;\n\u2022Additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and\n\u2022Established sales, marketing and worldwide distribution networks.\nBecause of the size of the market opportunity for the treatment of carotid artery disease, we believe potential competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to aggressively promote their products or develop new products. New treatment options may be developed that could compete more effectively with our products due to the prevalence of carotid artery disease and the extensive research efforts and technological progress that exist within the market.\nOur ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully and deliver any new products in a timely manner.\nThe market for our products is competitive, dynamic, and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation. New entrants or existing competitors could attempt to develop products that compete directly with\nours. Demand for our products and future related products could be diminished by equivalent or superior products and technologies offered by competitors. If we are unable to innovate successfully, our products could become obsolete and our revenue would decline as our customers purchase our competitors\u2019 products.\nWe are currently focused on improving existing products for TCAR, developing new products for TCAR, and developing new products for other disease states beyond carotid artery disease. If we are unable to develop new products, applications or features due to constraints, such as insufficient cash resources, high employee turnover, inability to hire personnel with sufficient technical skills or a lack of other research and development resources, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position compared to other companies. Furthermore, many of our competitors devote a considerably greater amount of funds to their research and development programs than we do, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to research and development programs. Our failure or inability to devote adequate research and development resources or compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors could harm our business.\nAny significant delays in our product launches may significantly impede our ability to enter or compete in a given market and may reduce the sales that we are able to generate from these products. We may experience delays in any phase of a product development, including during research and development, clinical trials, regulatory review, manufacturing and marketing. Delays in product introductions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDefects or failures associated with our products could lead to additional recalls, safety alerts or litigation, as well as significant costs and negative publicity.\nOur business is subject to significant risks associated with the manufacture, distribution and use of medical devices that are placed inside the human body, including the risk that patients may be severely injured by or even die from the misuse or malfunction of our products caused by design flaws or manufacturing defects. In addition, component failures, design defects, off-label uses or inadequate disclosure of product-related information could also result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient. These problems could lead to a recall or market withdrawal of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products and could result in significant costs, negative publicity and adverse competitive pressure. For example, in the first quarter of 2021, we announced the voluntary recall of certain lots of our ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent System, manufactured by Cordis. The circumstances giving rise to recalls are unpredictable, and any recalls of existing or future products increase the probability of inspection by, or additional scrutiny from, the FDA and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide a limited warranty that our products are free of material defects and conform to specifications, and offer to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of defective products. As a result, we bear the risk of potential warranty claims on our products. In the event that we attempt to recover some or all of the expenses associated with a warranty claim against us from our suppliers or vendors, we may not be successful in claiming recovery under any warranty or indemnity provided to us by such suppliers or vendors and any recovery from such vendor or supplier may not be adequate.\nThe medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims. Operating in the area of the neck with the brain as the end organ is dangerous and presents risks of adverse events such as bleeding, arterial dissection, cranial nerve injury, myocardial infarction, stroke and death, which subject us to a greater risk of being involved in litigation than companies with products used in less critical areas of the body. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products cause, or merely appear to have caused, an injury or death, even if due to physician error. In addition, an injury or death that is caused by the activities of our suppliers, such as those that provide us with components and materials, or by an aspect of a treatment used in combination with our products, such as a complementary drug or anesthesia, may be the basis for a claim against us by patients, hospitals, physicians or others purchasing or using our products, even if our products were not the actual cause of such injury or death. We may choose to settle any claims to avoid fault and complication not due to failure of our products. An adverse outcome involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all of our products, and could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future. In some circumstances, adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the suspension or delay of regulatory reviews of our premarket notifications or applications for marketing. Any of the foregoing problems could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we carry product liability insurance in the United States and in other countries in which we conduct business, including for clinical trials and product marketing, we can give no assurance that such coverage will be available or adequate to satisfy any claims. Product liability insurance is expensive, subject to significant deductibles and exclusions, and may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain or maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we\ncould be exposed to significant liabilities. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Defending a suit, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could be costly, could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and might result in adverse publicity, which could result in reduced acceptance of our products in the market, product recalls or market withdrawals.\nWe are required to file adverse event reports under Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulations with the FDA, which reports are publicly available on the FDA\u2019s website. We are required to file MDRs if our products may have caused or contributed to a serious injury or death or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a serious injury or death if it were to recur. Any such MDR that reports a significant adverse event could result in negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and future sales.\nThe failure of TCAR to meet patient expectations or the occurrence of adverse events from TCAR could impair our financial performance.\nOur future success depends upon patients having an experience with TCAR that meets their expectations in order to increase physician demand for our products as a result of positive feedback, social media and word-of-mouth. Patients may be dissatisfied if their expectations of the procedure and results, among other things, are not met. Despite what we believe to be the safety profile of our products, patients may experience adverse events such as arterial restenosis or dissection, cranial nerve injury, wound complications, transient ischemic attacks, stroke, heart attack, and death. If the results of TCAR do not meet the expectations of the patients, or patients experience adverse events, it could discourage patients from referring TCAR to others. For example, although we have not received any reports of strokes, deaths or other long-term patient sequelae from the tip detachments that triggered our recent recall, if there were to be patient injury, dissatisfied patients may express negative opinions through social media or we may otherwise suffer reputational damage or become subject to product liability lawsuits. Any failure to meet patient expectations and any resulting negative publicity or lawsuits could harm our reputation and future sales.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business.\nOur success depends largely on the continued services of key members of our executive management team and others in key management positions. For example, the services of Erica Rogers, our Chief Executive Officer, and Lucas Buchanan, our Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer, are essential to driving adoption of our products, executing on our corporate strategy and ensuring the continued operations and integrity of financial reporting within our company. In addition, the services of Andrew Davis, our Chief Commercial Officer, are critical to driving the growth in sales of our products. Any of our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. If we lose one or more key employees, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategy.\nIn addition, our research and development programs, and sales efforts depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled engineers and sales professionals. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified engineers and sales professionals in the future due to the competition for qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do. When we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers have previously and may in the future attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, which may result in a diversion of our time and resources and, potentially, damages. In addition, job candidates and existing employees, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment along with salary, benefits and other factors. If the perceived benefits of our stock awards decline, either because we are a public company or for other reasons, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed.\nThe use, misuse or off-label use of our products may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.\nThe ENROUTE stent has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of high surgical risk patients who require carotid revascularization and meet certain treatment parameters. If physicians expand the patient population in which they elect to use our products that is outside of the intended use approved by the FDA, then the use, misuse, or off-label use of our products may result in outcomes and adverse events including stroke, myocardial infarction and death, potentially leading to product liability claims. Our products are not indicated for use in all patients with carotid artery disease, and therefore cannot be marketed or advertised in the United States for certain uses without additional approvals or clearances from the FDA. However, we cannot prevent a physician from using our products for off-label applications or\nusing components or products that are not our products when performing TCAR. In addition, we cannot guarantee that physicians are trained by us or their peers prior to utilizing our products. Complications resulting from the use of our products off-label or use by physicians who have not been trained appropriately, or at all, may expose us to product liability claims and harm our reputation. Moreover, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or physician training, including our paid consultants\u2019 educational materials, constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to enforcement action, including warning letters, untitled letters, fines, penalties, or seizures. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines and/or other penalties against companies for alleged improper promotion and has investigated, prosecuted, and/or enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion.\nIn addition, if our products are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation initiated by physicians, hospitals or patients. Product liability claims are especially prevalent in the medical device industry and could harm our reputation, divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and may result in sizable damage awards against us. Although we maintain product liability insurance, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for future product liability claims. We may not be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, harm our reputation, significantly increase our expenses, and reduce product sales. Product liability claims could cause us to incur significant legal fees and deductibles and claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be harmed.\nAny growth that we experience in the future will require us to expand our sales, general and administrative personnel, manufacturing and distribution operations, and facilities and information technology infrastructure. In addition to the need to scale our organization, future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. Rapid expansion in personnel could mean that less experienced people manufacture, market and sell our products, which could result in inefficiencies and unanticipated costs, reduced quality and disruptions to our operations. In addition, rapid and significant growth may strain our administrative and operational infrastructure. Our ability to manage our business and growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our business could be harmed.\nAs demand for our products or any of our future products increases, we will need to continue to scale our capacity, expand customer service, billing and systems processes and enhance our internal quality assurance program. We cannot assure you that any increases in scale, related improvements and quality assurance will be successfully implemented or that appropriate personnel will be available to facilitate the growth of our business. Failure to implement necessary procedures, transition to new processes or hire the necessary personnel could result in higher costs or inability to meet increased demand. If we encounter difficulty meeting market demand, quality standards or physician expectations, our reputation could be harmed and our business could suffer.\nDue to our recent growth in our business, we have leased additional space to provide offices, manufacturing and distribution operations and facilities for the employees we expect to hire in Plymouth, Minnesota and are also considering additional leased facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area. There is competition for office, shipping and warehousing space in the San Francisco Bay area and elsewhere and we can provide no assurance that we will find additional space or that such space will be on reasonable terms. If we are unable to obtain additional space or support on commercially reasonable terms our costs may go up or our business operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may not be able to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs and commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and investments and expected revenue will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022The degree and rate of market acceptance of TCAR and our products;\n\u2022Whether we acquire third-party companies, products or technologies;\n\u2022Restructuring, refinancing or repayment of debt;\n\u2022The scope and timing of investment in our sales force, marketing initiatives and physician training programs;\n\u2022The scope, rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities, current or future clinical studies and additional regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u2022The scope and timing of investment in acute ischemic stroke and other neurovascular and cardiac products we develop;\n\u2022The costs associated with any future product recall that may occur;\n\u2022The costs of attaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022The impact of COVID-19, including new variants, on our business and operations;\n\u2022The emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments; and\n\u2022The rate at which we expand internationally.\nWe may seek to raise additional capital through equity offerings or debt financings and such additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, any additional equity or debt financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. For example, if we raise funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, the terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations including restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, effect certain mergers, incur debt, grant liens, pay dividends and distributions on capital stock, make investments and acquisitions, and enter into transactions with affiliates, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nIn the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms, such as relinquishment or licensing of certain technologies or products that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, or reserve for future potential arrangements when we might otherwise be able to achieve more favorable terms. In addition, we may be forced to work with a partner on one or more of our products or market development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, delay clinical trials necessary to market our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products. If this were to occur, our ability to grow and support our business and to respond to market challenges could be significantly limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs international expansion of our business occurs, it will expose us to market, regulatory, political, operational, financial, legal and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nOur long-term strategy is to increase our international presence, including but not limited to securing regulatory approvals in Japan and China. We currently have the right to affix the CE Mark to our products, allowing us to commercialize in Europe in the future if we choose to do so. This strategy may include establishing and maintaining physician outreach and education capabilities outside of the United States and expanding our relationships with international distributors, providers and payers. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022Difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations;\n\u2022Multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, privacy laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022Reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022Obtaining regulatory clearance where required for our products in various countries;\n\u2022Requirements to maintain data and the processing of that data on servers located within such countries;\n\u2022Complexities associated with managing multiple payer reimbursement regimes, government payers or patient self-pay systems;\n\u2022Difficulties in adequately training and managing international distributors;\n\u2022Limits on our ability to penetrate international markets if we are required to manufacture our products locally;\n\u2022Financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, foreign tax laws and complexities of foreign value-added tax systems, the effect of local and regional financial pressures on demand and payment for our products and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022Restrictions on the site-of-service for use of our products and the economics related thereto for physicians, providers and payers;\n\u2022Natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other market restrictions; and\n\u2022Regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over activities subject to regulation under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and comparable laws and regulations in other countries.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the terms of our existing intellectual property license and supply agreement with Cordis, there are certain restrictions on our ability to sell the ENROUTE stent through select direct competitors of Cordis Corporation. If we are unable to locate international distributors that are not select direct competitors to Cordis Corporation, to market and sell our ENROUTE stent, our ability to expand our business internationally may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of debt, which may affect our ability to operate our business and secure additional financing in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of approximately $49.0 million in principal outstanding under our Loan Agreement with Stifel Bank. We must make significant interest-only monthly payments under the Loan Agreement, which has diverted and will continue to divert resources from other activities. Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property, and we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, dispose of assets, effect certain mergers, incur debt, grant liens, pay dividends and distributions on capital stock, make investments and acquisitions, and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a loan facility of this size and type. The covenants related to the Loan Agreement, as well as any future financing agreements into which we may enter, may restrict our ability to finance our operations and engage in, expand or otherwise pursue our business activities and strategies. While we have not previously breached and are not currently in breach of these or any other covenants contained in our Loan Agreement, there can be no guarantee that we will not breach these covenants in the future. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and future breaches of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Loan Agreement. If not waived, future defaults could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the Loan Agreement to become immediately due and payable, termination of commitments to extend further credit, a 5% increase in the applicable rate of interest and the exercise by the lender of other rights and remedies provided for under the Loan Agreement. If we do not have or are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either upon maturity or in the event of a default, our assets could be foreclosed upon and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may negatively impact our ability to operate and continue our business as a going concern.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, or enter into license agreements, distribution arrangements or strategic partnerships, which could fail to result in a commercial product or generate sales, divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nAlthough we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such transactions, we may in the future seek to acquire, license or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our portfolio, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We could also seek to enter into distribution arrangements or strategic partnerships with third parties that we believe could increase our revenue or offer other commercial benefits. However, we cannot assure you that we would be able to successfully complete any acquisition, license agreement or distribution agreement we choose to pursue, or that we would be able to successfully integrate any business or product or technology in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we would derive benefits from any distribution arrangement or other strategic partnership. The pursuit of potential acquisition, license or partnering opportunities may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable transactions, whether or not they are consummated. We may not be able to identify desirable acquisition targets or strategic partners, or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target or partner, or obtain the expected benefits of any acquisition, license, investment or other strategic partnership arrangement.\nTo date, the growth of our operations has been largely organic, and we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses or technologies. We may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired personnel, operations and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following an acquisition. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the use of our available cash, or the incurrence of debt, which could harm our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business, product or technology fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $301.3 million and $254.5 million, respectively. Our U.S. federal NOLs arising in tax years ending on or before December 31, 2017 are subject to expiration and will begin to expire in 2027 (U.S. federal NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 are not subject to expiration) and our state NOLs will begin to expire in 2028. We may use these NOLs to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. However, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, may limit the NOLs we may use in any year for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the event of certain changes in ownership of our company. An \u201cownership change\u201d pursuant to Section 382 of the Code generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of a company\u2019s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Although we have not performed a formal study under Section 382 of the Code, we believe we may have experienced at least one \u201cownership change\u201d in the past and may have experienced others. In addition, future issuances or sales of our stock, including certain transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control, could result in future \u201cownership changes.\u201d \u201cOwnership changes\u201d that have occurred in the past or that may occur in the future could result in the imposition of an annual limit on the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs and other tax attributes we can use to reduce our taxable income or income tax liability, potentially increasing and accelerating our liability for income taxes, and also potentially causing those tax attributes to expire unused. Any limitation on using NOLs could, depending on the extent of such limitation and the NOLs previously used, result in our retaining less cash after payment of U.S. federal and state income taxes during any year in which we have taxable income, rather than losses, than we would be entitled to retain if such NOLs were available as an offset against such income for U.S. federal and state income tax reporting purposes, which could adversely impact our operating results. Furthermore, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, although the treatment of U.S. federal NOLs arising in tax years beginning on or before December 31, 2017 has generally not changed, U.S. federal NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 may only be used to offset 80% of our taxable income. This change may require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes in future years despite generating a loss for federal income tax purposes in prior years.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or our customers or patients, or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may become exposed to, or collect and store sensitive data, including procedure-based information and legally-protected health information, credit card, and other financial information, insurance information, and other potentially personally identifiable information. We also store sensitive intellectual property and other proprietary business information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology, or IT, and infrastructure, and that of our other technology partners, may be vulnerable to cyber attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. We rely extensively on IT systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in\nconducting our business. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure, by our workforce, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our or our third-party providers' systems, portable media or storage devices. We could also experience a business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Although the aggregate impact on our operations and financial condition has not been material to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue as cybersecurity threats have been rapidly evolving in sophistication and becoming more prevalent in the industry. We are investing in protections and monitoring practices with respect to our data and IT to reduce these risks and continue to monitor our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches to our or our third-party providers\u2019 databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws and any investigation, and the outcome of any investigation, by government agencies of possible violations by us of the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from corruptly providing any benefits to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are in the process of further enhancing policies and procedures intended to help ensure compliance with these laws. In the future, we may operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Moreover, because of the significant role government entities play in the regulation of many foreign healthcare markets, we may be exposed to heightened FCPA and similar risks arising from our efforts to seek regulatory approval of and reimbursement for our products in such countries. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from improper acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, would significantly disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may become a party to intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell and market our products.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. It is possible that U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications or trademarks controlled by third parties may be alleged to cover our products, or that we may be accused of misappropriating third parties\u2019 trade secrets. Additionally, our products include components that we purchase from vendors, and may include design components that are outside of our direct control. Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios, trade secrets, trademarks, and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for or obtain, patents or trademarks that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use, sell and/or export our products or to use product names. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups that are non-practicing entities have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement in order to extract settlements. From time to time, we may receive threatening letters, notices or \u201cinvitations to license,\u201d or may be the subject of claims that our products and business operations infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. The defense of these matters can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand and cause us to incur significant expenses or make substantial payments. Vendors from whom we purchase hardware or software may not indemnify us in the event that such hardware or software is accused of infringing a third-party\u2019s patent or trademark or of misappropriating a third-party\u2019s trade secret.\nSince some patent applications are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our products. Competitors may also contest our patents, if issued, by showing the patent examiner that the invention was not novel or was obvious. In litigation, a competitor could claim that our patents, if issued, are not valid for a number of reasons. If a court agrees, we would lose our rights to those challenged patents.\nIn addition, we may in the future be subject to claims by our former employees or consultants asserting an ownership right in our patents or patent applications, as a result of the work they performed on our behalf. Although we generally require all of our employees and consultants and any other partners or collaborators who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to assign or grant similar rights to their inventions to us, we cannot be certain that we\nhave executed such agreements with all parties who may have contributed to our intellectual property, nor can we be certain that our agreements with such parties will be upheld in the face of a potential challenge, or that they will not be breached, for which we may not have an adequate remedy.\nFurther, if patents, trademarks, or trade secrets are successfully asserted against us, this may harm our business and result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products, license fees, damages and the payment of attorney fees and court costs. In addition, if we are found to willfully infringe third-party patents or trademarks or to have misappropriated trade secrets, we could be required to pay treble damages in addition to other penalties. Although patent, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement.\nSimilarly, interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may be necessary to determine priority with respect to our patents, patent applications, trademarks or trademark applications. We may also become involved in other proceedings, such as reexamination, inter parties review, derivation or opposition proceedings before the USPTO or other jurisdictional body relating to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing our products or using product names, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we may file lawsuits or initiate other proceedings to protect or enforce our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. Competitors may infringe our issued patents, trademarks or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. Furthermore, even if our patents are found to be valid and infringed, a court may refuse to grant injunctive relief against the infringer and instead grant us monetary damages and/or ongoing royalties. Such monetary compensation may be insufficient to adequately offset the damage to our business caused by the infringer\u2019s competition in the market. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will depend on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must develop, maintain and protect the proprietary aspects of our brands, technologies and data. We rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our brands, technologies and data. These legal measures afford only limited protection, and competitors or others may gain access to or use our intellectual property and proprietary information. Our success will depend, in part, on preserving our trade secrets, maintaining the security of our data and know-how and obtaining and maintaining other intellectual property rights. We may not be able to obtain or maintain intellectual property or other proprietary rights necessary to our business or in a form that provides us with a competitive advantage. In addition, our trade secrets, data and know-how could be subject to unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure to unauthorized parties, despite our efforts to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, clients and other vendors who have access to such information, and could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by third parties. Our intellectual property, including trademarks, could be challenged, invalidated, infringed, and circumvented by third parties, and our trademarks could also be diluted, declared generic or found to be infringing on other marks. If any of the foregoing occurs, we could be forced to re-brand our products, resulting in loss of brand recognition and requiring us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands, and suffer other competitive harm. Third parties may also adopt trademarks similar to ours, which could harm our brand identity and lead to market confusion. Failure to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights necessary to our business and failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our intellectual property rights could negatively impact our ability to compete and cause us to incur significant expenses. The intellectual property laws and other statutory and contractual arrangements in the United States and other jurisdictions we depend upon may not provide sufficient protection in the future to prevent the infringement, use, violation or misappropriation of our trademarks, data, technology and other intellectual property and services, and may not provide an adequate remedy if our intellectual property rights are infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated.\nWe rely, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, expand, enforce, and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio or other proprietary rights, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights. The process of applying for and obtaining a patent is expensive, time consuming and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous, or we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights at all. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the issuance of a patent does not ensure that it is valid or enforceable, so even if we obtain patents, they may not be valid or enforceable against third parties. Our patent applications may not result in issued patents and our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Moreover, even if we are able to obtain patent protection, such patent protection may be of insufficient scope to achieve our business objectives. Issued patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Decisions by courts and governmental patent agencies may introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of patents owned by or licensed to us. Furthermore, the issuance of a patent does not give us the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our own products and practicing our own technology. Alternatively, third parties may seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend and/or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid, unenforceable or not infringed; competitors may then be able to market products and use manufacturing and analytical processes that are substantially similar to ours. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our other proprietary information, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of trade secrets, and other proprietary information that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and some courts are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. To maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information, we rely heavily on confidentiality provisions that we have in contracts with our employees, consultants, collaborators and others upon the commencement of their relationship with us. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by such third parties, despite the existence generally of these confidentiality restrictions. These contracts may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information. There can be no assurance that such third parties will not breach their agreements with us, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. Despite the protections we do place on our intellectual property or other proprietary rights, monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property or other proprietary rights will be adequate. In addition, the laws of many foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property or other proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited abroad, which could affect our ability to expand to international markets or require costly efforts to protect our technology.\nTo the extent our intellectual property or other proprietary information protection is incomplete, we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology, or develop similar technology. Our competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts or design around our protected technology. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm the value of our products, brand and business. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our products and harm our business, the value of our investment in research and development or acquisitions could be reduced and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of their confidential or proprietary information. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions. If we fail to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, or if our competitors obtain our trade secrets or independently develop technology similar to ours or competing technologies, our\ncompetitive market position could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some courts are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets and agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and might not be enforceable in certain cases.\nWe also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and other confidential information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential information and enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated confidential information is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breach.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nA company may attempt to commercialize competing products utilizing our proprietary design, trademarks or tradenames in foreign countries where we do not have sufficient patent protection and where legal recourse may be limited. This may have a significant commercial impact on our foreign business operations.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents or trademarks on our current and future products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability and trademarking may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from utilizing our inventions and trademarks in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies or trademarks in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent or trademark protection to develop or market their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent and trademark protection, but enforcement on infringing activities is inadequate. These products or trademarks may compete with our products or trademarks, and our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents and trademarks or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent and trademarks rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents and trademarks at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent or trademark applications at risk, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. In addition, certain countries in Europe and certain developing countries, including India and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if our patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to our patents to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license. Finally, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property of a third party, including trade secrets or know-how, or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors and third parties may claim an ownership interest in intellectual property we regard as our own.\nMany of our employees and consultants were previously employed at or engaged by other medical device, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, consultants and contractors, may have executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, misappropriated the intellectual property or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information, of these former employers or competitors.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to claims from third parties challenging our ownership interest in intellectual property we regard as our own, based on claims that our employees or consultants have breached an obligation to assign inventions to another employer, to a former employer, or to another person or entity. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any other claims, and it may be necessary or we may desire to enter into a license to settle any such claim; however, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers.\nAn inability to incorporate technologies or features that are important or essential to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may prevent us from selling our products. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our existing and future products.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. In 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These also include provisions that switched the United States from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, allow third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and set forth additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by the USPTO administered post grant proceedings. Under a first-to-file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The USPTO developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective in 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement and defense of our patents and applications. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, foreign courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by U.S. and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents or patent applications and our ability to obtain additional patent protection in the future.\nThe failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, and other obligations could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, consultants, alliance partners and other third parties to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our products and manage certain parts of our business. Using these third parties poses a number of risks, such as: (i) they may not perform to our standards or legal requirements; (ii) they may not produce reliable results; (iii) they may not perform in a timely manner; (iv) they may not maintain confidentiality of our proprietary information; (v) disputes may arise with respect to ownership of rights to technology developed with our partners; and (vi) disagreements could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of our products or result in litigation or arbitration. Moreover, some third parties are located in markets subject to political and social risk, corruption, infrastructure problems and natural disasters, in addition to country-specific privacy and data security risk given current legal and regulatory environments. Failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, and other obligations may materially affect our business.\nIf our trademarks and tradenames are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on trademarks, service marks, tradenames and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register these trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in proceedings before the USPTO and comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources towards advertising and marketing new brands and managing through regulatory implications such as relabeling. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. Certain of our current or future trademarks may become so well known by the public that their use becomes generic and they lose trademark protection. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nHealthcare policy changes, including recently enacted legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States, which made a number of substantial changes in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other ways in which it may affect our business, the Affordable Care Act:\n\u2022Established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research;\n\u2022Implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and\n\u2022Expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs.\nWe do not yet know the full impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on our business. The taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act and the expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased sale of our products and, lower reimbursement by payers for our products, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Biden Administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the Affordable Care Act, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. Additionally, all or a portion of the Affordable Care Act and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge, which could result in lower numbers of insured individuals, reduced coverage for insured individuals and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare\npayments to providers by 2% per fiscal year, effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, enacted on April 16, 2015, repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments which began in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians\u2019 participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations. It is unclear what effect new quality and payment programs, such as MACRA, may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe expect additional state and federal healthcare policies and reform measures to be adopted in the future. Any of these could make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products or to manufacture, market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained. They could result in reduced demand for our products or result in additional pricing pressure. Any such reforms could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our customers. Any changes of, or uncertainty with respect to, future coverage or reimbursement rates could affect demand for our products, which in turn could impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products and could have an adverse material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes and reforms in the European Union and other countries where we may decide to commercialize could have similar effects.\nChanges in the CMS fee schedules may harm our revenue and operating results.\nGovernment payers, such as Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, as well as insurers, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. From time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered and implemented changes in the CMS fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. Reductions of reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for procedures that use our products or changes in policy regarding coverage of these procedures, such as adding requirements for payment, or prior authorizations, may be implemented from time to time. Reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third-party payers may occur as well. Similar changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments for procedures that use medical device products as well as added costs and have added more complex regulatory and administrative requirements. Further changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and on our business. Actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with broad based healthcare and other governmental regulations, we could face substantial fines and penalties and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe products we offer are highly regulated, and there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly and adversely in the future. Our arrangements with physicians, hospitals and medical centers will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations that may restrict the financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products. Our employees, consultants, and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements. Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to conduct business, include, without limitation:\n\u2022Federal and state laws and regulations regarding billing and claims payment applicable to TCAR and regulatory agencies enforcing those laws and regulations;\n\u2022FDA prohibitions against the advertisement, promotion and labeling of our products for off-label uses, or uses outside the specific indications approved by the FDA;\n\u2022The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which broadly prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the CMS programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties per violation, plus up to\nthree times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines and imprisonment. Similarly, violations can result in mandatory exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022The federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government. These laws can apply to manufacturers who provide inaccurate information on coverage, coding, and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill third-party payers. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022Federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making, or causing to be made, false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022The FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and other local anti-corruption laws that apply to our international activities;\n\u2022The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or Open Payments, created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to licensed physicians, certain other healthcare professionals, and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations, to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Additionally, on October 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the \u201cSubstance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promoted Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act\u201d which in part (under a provision entitled \u201cFighting the Opioid Epidemic with Sunshine\u201d) extends the reporting and transparency requirements for physicians in the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners (with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021). Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. Our failure to submit required information on time may result in civil monetary penalties with additional amounts for \u201cknowing failures\u201d, for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; HIPAA also created criminal liability for knowingly and willfully falsifying or concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards when applicable can result in civil monetary penalties, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties including fines and/or imprisonment. State attorneys general can also bring a civil action to enjoin a HIPAA violation or to obtain statutory damages on behalf of residents of his or her state; and\n\u2022Analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers or patients; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm customers, foreign and state laws, including the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, governing the privacy and security of health\ninformation in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions or safe harbors, it is possible that some of our activities, such as stock-option compensation paid to physicians, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. We may be subject to private \u201cqui tam\u201d actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments.\nThe growth of our business and sales organization and our planned expansion outside of the United States may increase the potential of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state and foreign laws described above or any other current or future fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, for individuals, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for our products, or if clearances or approvals for future products and indications are delayed or not issued, our commercial operations would be harmed.\nOur products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by regulatory agencies in other countries where we do business. Government regulations specific to medical devices are wide ranging and govern, among other things:\n\u2022Product design, development and manufacture;\n\u2022Laboratory, preclinical and clinical testing, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution;\n\u2022Premarketing clearance or approval;\n\u2022Record keeping;\n\u2022Product marketing, promotion and advertising, sales and distribution; and\n\u2022Post-marketing surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and recalls and correction and removals.\nBefore a new medical device, including our recently FDA approved IDE for our feasibility study in acute ischemic stroke, Neuroprotection in Transcarotid Embolectomy (NITE-1), or a new intended use for an existing product, can be marketed in the United States, a company must first submit and receive either 510(k) clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, or approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application from the FDA, unless an exemption applies.\nIn many cases, the process of obtaining PMA approval, which was required for the ENROUTE stent, is much more rigorous, costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a device legally on the market, known as a \u201cpredicate\u201d device, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. To be \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the PMA approval process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based on extensive data, including technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices for which the 510(k) process cannot be used and that are deemed to pose the greatest risk. Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally need prior FDA approval of a PMA supplement. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k), or such modification may put the device into class III and require PMA approval. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12\nmonths, but may last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the PMA is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u2022Our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable regulatory entity or notified body that our products are safe or effective for their intended uses;\n\u2022The disagreement of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body with the design, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials or the analyses or interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022Serious and unexpected adverse device effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials;\n\u2022The data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required;\n\u2022Our inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the device outweigh the risks;\n\u2022An advisory committee, if convened by the applicable regulatory authority, may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the applicable regulatory authority require, as a condition of approval, additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions, or even if an advisory committee, if convened, makes a favorable recommendation, the respective regulatory authority may still not approve the product;\n\u2022The applicable regulatory authority may identify significant deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, facilities or analytical methods or those of our third party contract manufacturers;\n\u2022The potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory bodies to change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance or approval; and\n\u2022The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may audit our clinical trial data and conclude that the data is not sufficiently reliable to support approval or clearance.\nSimilarly, regulators may determine that our financial relationships with our principal investigators resulted in a perceived or actual conflict of interest that may have affected the interpretation of a study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site or the utility of the clinical trial itself. Even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for the product, which may limit the market for the product. Moreover, the FDA and European Union regulatory authorities strictly regulate the labeling, promotion and advertising of our products, including comparative and superiority claims vis a vis competitors\u2019 products, that may be made about products.\nAs a condition of approving a PMA application, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. As a part of our PMA approval, we agreed with the FDA to conduct a post-approval study at a minimum of 30 sites in the United States to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our products in at least 600 subjects. We completed enrollment in this study and submitted our final report to the FDA. In February 2020 we received notice from the FDA of their review and that we have fulfilled the post-approval study requirement. A PMA supplement with the updated labeling was submitted to FDA in December 2019 and subsequently approved by FDA in June 2020. The updated labeling included outcomes and adverse event data from the ROADSTER 2 Post-Approval Study. Failure to have conducted the post-approval study in compliance with applicable regulations or to have timely completed required post-approval studies or comply with other post-approval requirements could result in withdrawal of approval of the PMA, which would harm our business.\nIn addition, we are required to investigate all product complaints we receive, and timely file reports with the FDA, including MDRs that require that we report to regulatory authorities if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If these reports are not submitted in a timely manner, regulators may impose sanctions and we may be subject to product liability or regulatory enforcement actions, including warning letters, untitled letters, fines, civil penalties, recalls, seizures, operating restrictions, denial of requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new\nproducts, new intended uses or modifications to existing products, withdrawal of current 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals and narrowing of approved or cleared product labeling, all of which could harm our business. In addition, the FDA may provide notice of and conduct additional inspections, such as \u201cfor cause\u201d inspections, of our business, sites and facilities as part of its review process. As of February 28, 2022, we had filed 495 MDR reports with the FDA for adverse events and device malfunctions including, but not limited to, stroke, arterial dissection, tip detachment, stent thrombosis and wound complications.\nIf we initiate a correction or removal action for our products to reduce a significant risk to health posed by our products, we would be required to submit a publicly available correction and removal report to the FDA and, in many cases, similar reports to other regulatory agencies. This report could be classified by the FDA as a device recall which could lead to an additional inspection by, or increased scrutiny from, the FDA, other international regulatory agencies and our customers regarding the quality and safety of our products. Furthermore, the submission of these reports could be used by competitors against us and cause physicians to delay or cancel prescriptions, which could harm our reputation. For example, in the first quarter of 2021, we announced the voluntary recall of certain lots of our ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent System, manufactured by Cordis. Recalls like this one could cause the supply of our TCAR products to customers to be interrupted, us to incur additional expenses, negative publicity or damage to our reputation, any of which could cause our results of operations to be adversely impacted.\nThe FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the advertising, promotion and labeling of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances and approvals, that there is adequate and reasonable scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading in any respect. If the FDA or FTC determines that any of our advertising or promotional claims are misleading, not substantiated or not permissible, we may be subject to enforcement actions, including adverse publicity, warning letters, and we may be required to revise our promotional claims and make other corrections or restitutions.\nThe FDA and state authorities have broad investigation and enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022Adverse publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022Repair, replacement, refunds, recalls, termination of distribution, administrative detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022Denial of our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products;\n\u2022Withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u2022Criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our business and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, the FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our products. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate competent and reliable evidence of the safety and effectiveness of our products, which would prevent or delay commercialization of our products in development.\nWe may be required to conduct clinical studies that demonstrate competent and reliable evidence that our products are safe and effective before we can commercialize our products. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. We cannot be certain that our planned clinical trials or any other future clinical trials will be successful. In addition, even if such clinical trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our products for approval. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, we may be required to expend significant resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our products.\nEven if regulatory approval is secured for any of our products, the terms of such approval may limit the scope and use of our products, which may also limit their commercial potential.\nMaterial modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances, premarket approval, or CE Marks, or may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until new clearances or approvals are obtained.\nMaterial modifications to the intended use or technological characteristics of our products will require new 510(k) clearances, premarket approvals or CE Marks prior to implementing the modifications, or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances or approvals are obtained. Furthermore, changes to our manufacturing facility or supplier of components used in our products require prior FDA approval of a PMA supplement. The FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance; however, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision. Any modification to an FDA cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA supplement. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining required future clearances would harm our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth. We have made modifications to our products in the past that we believe do not require additional clearances or approvals, and we may make additional modifications in the future. If the FDA or an EU Notified Body disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for any of these modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop selling or marketing our products as modified, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our products. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions.\nIf we, or our suppliers, fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, the European Union\u2019s Medical Device Directive, or the European Union\u2019s Medical Device Regulation, our manufacturing or distribution operations could be delayed or shut down and our revenue could suffer.\nOur manufacturing and design processes and those of our third-party component suppliers are required to comply with the QSR and the European Union\u2019s Medical Device Directive, or MDD, and the European Union\u2019s Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, which cover procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. We are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses, and to ongoing ISO 13485 compliance in our operations, including design, manufacturing, and service, to maintain our CE Mark. In addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our facilities and records for periodic unannounced inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA, state authorities, EU Notified Bodies and comparable agencies in other countries. If we fail a regulatory inspection, our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing interrupted. Failure to take timely and adequate corrective action in response to an adverse regulatory inspection could result in, among other things, a shutdown of our manufacturing or product distribution operations, significant fines, suspension of marketing clearances and approvals, seizures or recalls of our device, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which would cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, which may result in manufacturing delays for our products and cause our revenue to decline.\nWe are registered with the FDA as a medical device specifications developer, manufacturer and complaint file establishment. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health, or CDPH, and our Notified Body to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations at both our design and manufacturing facilities, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. These inspections may be initiated as a result of concerns regarding the safety of our products or the components thereof.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will continue to remain in material compliance with the QSR, MDD, or MDR. If the FDA, CDPH or our notified body in the European Union, BSI, inspect any of our facilities and discover compliance problems, we may have to cease manufacturing and product distribution until we can take the appropriate remedial steps to correct the audit findings. Taking corrective action may be expensive, time consuming and a distraction for management and if we experience a delay at our manufacturing facility we may be unable to produce our products, which would harm our business.\nWith the transition from the MDD to the new MDR, notified bodies are required to seek designation to operate as conformity assessment authorities under the new law, which was effective in May 2021. BSI, our notified body, successfully obtained designation to operate as conformity assessment authorities under the new law.\nThe impact of the new EU Medical Device Regulation may be costly and disruptive to our business.\nThe European Union has released regulations to ensure patient safety with the use of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and in-vitro diagnostics. The new regulations replace predecessor directives and emphasize a global convergence of regulations. Major changes include:\n\u2022Reclassification of some products;\n\u2022Greater emphasis on clinical data;\n\u2022Data transparency, including publication of clinical trial data and safety summaries;\n\u2022Defined content and structure for technical files to support registration;\n\u2022Unique device identification system;\n\u2022Greater burden on post-market surveillance and clinical follow-up;\n\u2022Reduction of adverse event reporting time from 30 to 15 days after the event; and\n\u2022More power to notified bodies.\nCompliance with these new regulations may result in Europe being less attractive as a \u201cfirst market\u201d destination. Marketing authorization timelines will become more protracted and the costs of operating in Europe will increase. A significantly more costly path to regulatory compliance is anticipated. Adjusting to the new Medical Device Regulation may prove to be costly and disruptive to our business.\nOur products have and may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation.\nThe FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us has occurred, and could occur again in the future, as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design or labeling defects. In January 2021, we announced the voluntary recall of certain lots of our ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent System. Additional recalls of our products would divert managerial attention, be expensive, harm our reputation with customers and harm our financial condition and results of operations. Additional recall announcements could also negatively affect our stock price.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations could be expensive, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability.\nOur research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal, remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous substances and the sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of products containing hazardous substances. Liability under environmental laws and regulations can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and noncompliance could result in substantial liabilities, fines and penalties, personal injury and third-party property damage claims and substantial investigation and remediation costs. Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We cannot assure you that violations of these laws and regulations will not occur in the future or have not occurred in the past as a result of human error, accidents, equipment failure or other causes. The expense associated with environmental regulation and remediation could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n\u2022Changes in analysts\u2019 estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts, the loss of analyst coverage or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 estimates;\n\u2022Quarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022Periodic fluctuations in our revenue, which could be due in part to the way in which we recognize revenue;\n\u2022The financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022General market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including deteriorating market conditions due to investor concerns regarding inflation and hostilities between Russia and Ukraine;\n\u2022Changes in reimbursement by current or potential payers;\n\u2022Changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in the medical device industry in particular;\n\u2022Actual or anticipated changes in regulatory oversight of our products;\n\u2022The results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022The loss of key personnel, including changes in our board of directors and management;\n\u2022Product recalls or other problems associated with our products;\n\u2022Legislation or regulation of our market;\n\u2022Lawsuits threatened or filed against us, including litigation by current or former employees alleging wrongful termination, sexual harassment, whistleblower or other claims;\n\u2022The announcement of new products, product enhancements or new product trials by us or our competitors;\n\u2022Announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022Announcements related to patents issued to us or our competitors and related litigation; and\n\u2022Developments in our industry.\nIn recent years, the stock markets generally have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to comply with, among other requirements, the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. If we have a material weakness, we would receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered accounting firm.\nOur compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We have engaged outside consultants who function in the capacity of an internal audit group, and we will continue to hire additional consultants, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge as we maintain the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our\nfinancial reports, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy our current and any future material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and Delaware law, could discourage a change in control of our company or a change in our management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover. These provisions include:\n\u2022Advance notice requirements applicable to stockholders for matters to be brought before a meeting of stockholders and requirements as to the form and content of a stockholders\u2019 notice;\n\u2022A supermajority stockholder vote requirement for amending certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022The right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer;\n\u2022Allowing stockholders to remove directors only for cause;\n\u2022A requirement that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022Allowing all vacancies, including newly created directorships, to be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, except as otherwise required by law;\n\u2022A requirement that our stockholders may only take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022Limiting the forum to Delaware for certain litigation against us; and\n\u2022Limiting the persons that can call special meetings of our stockholders to our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, the chief executive officer or the president, in the absence of a chief executive officer.\nThese provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management. The existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. See \u201cDescription of Capital Stock.\u201d\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 abilities to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against the company or any director or officer of the company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (5) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or federal court located within the State of Delaware if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. A complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act may be brought in state or federal court. With respect to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, only claims brought derivatively under the Exchange Act would be subject to the forum selection clause described above. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies' certificates of incorporation and bylaws has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any action, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. Although we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law for the specified types of actions and proceedings, the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our shares of capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this exclusive forum provision, but will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and, as a result, any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects for future earnings and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our loan agreement limits our ability to, among other things, pay dividends or make other distributions or payments on account of our common stock, in each case subject to certain exceptions. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates and you then sell our common stock.", "PERMNO": 18566, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "SILK"}
