{"cik": "1051741", "company": "FIRST NIAGARA FINANCIAL GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors\nMaking or continuing an investment in securities issued by the Company, including our common stock, involves certain risks that you should carefully consider. The following are the key risk factors that affect us. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price for your securities could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nThe Company will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger with KeyCorp is pending, which could adversely affect its business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger with KeyCorp on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company, and, consequently, KeyCorp. These uncertainties may impair the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with the Company to seek to change their existing business relationships with the Company. Retention of certain employees at the Company may be challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts the Company from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions without the consent of KeyCorp until the Merger occurs. These restrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. See the Proxy Statement/Prospectus for a description of the restrictive covenants to which the Company is subject.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed.\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include: the approval of the Merger proposal by Company and KeyCorp shareholders, as well as approval of the amendments to KeyCorp's articles by KeyCorp's shareholders, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, absence of orders prohibiting completion of the Merger, approval of the shares of KeyCorp common stock and the new KeyCorp preferred stock to be issued to Company common and preferred shareholders, as applicable, and the continued representations and warranties by both parties (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement), and the performance by both parties of their covenants and agreements, and the receipt by both parties of legal opinions from their respective tax counsels. These conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may not be completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed by October 30, 2016, either KeyCorp or the Company may choose not to proceed with the Merger. Moreover, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after shareholder approval. KeyCorp and the Company may also elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, First Niagara may be required to pay a termination fee of $137.5 million to KeyCorp. See the Proxy Statement/Prospectus for a further description of these circumstances.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact the Company.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Company shareholders declining to approve the Merger Agreement, the ongoing business of the Company may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, the Company would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price (including to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed) and credit ratings downgrades;\n\u2022\nthe Company may experience negative reactions from its customers, vendors and employees;\n\u2022\nthe Company will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed, including the termination fee;\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of the Company's businesses prior to completion of the Merger. Such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of KeyCorp (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent the Company from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger, including acquisitions (see the Proxy Statement/Prospectus for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to the Company); and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by Company management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to the Company as an independent company.\nIn addition to the above risks, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company's board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, Company shareholders cannot be certain that the Company will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration Keycorp has agreed to provide in the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to pay a termination fee of $137.5 million to KeyCorp. See the Proxy Statement/Prospectus for additional information.\nBecause the market price of KeyCorp common stock may fluctuate, Company shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive in the Merger.\nUpon completion of the Merger, each share of Company common stock will be converted into the per share merger consideration consisting of shares of KeyCorp common stock and cash pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The stock portion of the merger consideration that Company shareholders will receive is a fixed number of shares of KeyCorp common stock; it is not a number of shares with a particular fixed market value. The market value of KeyCorp common stock and Company common stock at the effective time of the Merger may vary significantly from their respective values on the date the merger agreement was executed or at other dates, including the date on which Company shareholders vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Because the exchange ratio relating to the stock portion of the merger consideration is fixed at 0.680 and will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the market value of KeyCorp common shares or Company common stock, the market value of the KeyCorp common shares issued in connection with the Merger and the Company common stock converted in connection with the Merger may be higher or lower than the values of those shares on earlier dates, and may be higher or lower than the value used to determine the exchange ratio.\nThere will be a time lapse between each of the date of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the date on which Company shareholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement at the special meeting and the date on which Company shareholders entitled to receive shares of KeyCorp common stock actually receive such shares. The market value of KeyCorp common stock may fluctuate during these periods as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in KeyCorp\u2019s businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are outside of the control of the Company and KeyCorp. Consequently, at the time Company shareholders must decide whether to approve the Merger Agreement, they will not know the actual market value of the shares of KeyCorp common stock they will receive when the Merger is completed. The actual value of the shares of KeyCorp common stock received by Company shareholders will depend on the market value of shares of KeyCorp common stock on that date. This market value may be less or more than the value used to determine the Exchange Ratio.\nLitigation relating to the Merger could require us to incur significant costs and suffer management distraction, as well as delay and/or enjoin the Merger\nEight shareholders of the Company have filed separate putative class action complaints challenging the merger. Six complaints are filed in New York State Supreme Court, Erie County. One complaint is filed in the Court of Chancery, Delaware, and one is filed in United States District Court, District of Delaware. The complaints are brought against the Company, each of its directors individually, and KeyCorp. The complaints allege generally that each of the directors breached his or her fiduciary duty to the Company's public shareholders in that: (a) the sales process was flawed; (b) the merger consideration is inadequate and undervalues the intrinsic value of the Company; (c) the merger agreement contains unfair preclusive deal protection devices; and (d) certain directors and officers of the Company will receive personal benefits from the merger not shared in by other public shareholders. Seven of the complaints further allege that KeyCorp and the Company aided and abetted the Company's directors\u2019 fiduciary duty breaches. Some of the complaints also challenge KeyCorp\u2019s anticipated contribution to the First Niagara Foundation or that the Company's Registration Statement filed on November 30, 2015 in connection with the proposed merger is materially misleading. The complaint filed in U.S. District Court, District of Delaware also alleges that the preliminary proxy filed in connection with the November 30, 2015 Registration Statement violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder.\nAll of the lawsuits seek, among other things, to enjoin or rescind the Merger, and to obtain an award of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees and damages for the alleged fiduciary breaches.\nPlaintiffs in all six of the matters pending in Erie County, New York entered into and filed a joint stipulation seeking consolidation of the actions, and appointment of designated co-lead plaintiffs and co-lead counsel for the actions. The stipulation is pending before the court.\nThe defendants believe these lawsuits are entirely without merit, and intended to vigorously defend against the claims.\nThe Company and KeyCorp also could be subject to additional demands or litigation related to the Merger whether or not the Merger is completed.\nEconomic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity, profitability, and financial condition\nFrom December 2007 through June 2009, the U.S. economy was in recession, and the recovery to date has been weaker than expected by many market participants at the end of the recession. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. was greatly reduced. Although economic conditions have improved, certain sectors remain weak and unemployment remains high. Most recently, oil prices have declined significantly, with the price of oil decreasing to below $30 per barrel, from a high of $110 per barrel in 2011. Recovery by many businesses has been impaired by lower consumer spending. A return to prolonged or deteriorating economic conditions could have one or more of the following adverse effects on our business:\n\u2022\nDecrease in the demand for loans and other products and services that we offer driving even higher competition;\n\u2022\nDecrease in net interest income derived from our lending and deposit gathering activities;\n\u2022\nDecrease in the value of our investment securities;\n\u2022\nDecrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate;\n\u2022\nImpairment of certain tangible and intangible assets, such as goodwill; and\n\u2022\nIncrease in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for loan losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.\nOverall interest rates have been at historically low levels for an unprecedented long time. Low interest rates, compounded by a flattening yield curve, challenge banks' net interest margin which is the main driver of income for banks of our size and scope.\nConcentration in real estate loans in our footprint may increase our exposure to credit risk\nAt December 31, 2015, our portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $8.7 billion, or 36% of total loans. While our concentration of commercial real estate loans in New York has steadily decreased over the past several years, from 68% at December 31, 2010 to 50% at December 31, 2015, a large portion of this portfolio remains concentrated in this geographical area.\nAt December 31, 2015, our portfolio of residential real estate loans (including home equity loans) totaled $6.4 billion, or 27% of total loans. While our concentration in these loans in New York has steadily decreased over the past several years, from 67% at December 31, 2010 to 45% at December 31, 2015, a large portion of this portfolio remains concentrated in this geographical area.\nA significant weakening in economic conditions in New York, such as unemployment or other factors beyond our control, could reduce our ability to generate new loans and increase default rates on these loans and otherwise negatively affect our financial results. A decline in real estate valuations in New York could lower the value of the collateral securing our residential real estate loans, leading to higher credit losses.\nCommercial real estate and business loans increase our exposure to credit risks\nAt December 31, 2015, our portfolio of commercial real estate and business loans totaled $14.7 billion, or 61% of total loans. We plan to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans, which generally expose us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential real estate loans because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one commercial loan outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential real estate loan.\nMore recently, we have emphasized our construction lending business. At December 31, 2015, our construction loans totaled $1.3 billion, or 5% of total loans. There are risks inherent in construction lending, as the value of the project is uncertain prior to the completion of construction and subsequent lease-up. A sudden downturn in the economy could result in stalled projects or collateral shortfalls, thus exposing us to increased credit risk.\nConcentration of loans in our primary market area may increase risk\nOur success is impacted by the general economic conditions in the geographic areas in which we operate, primarily New York, Western and Eastern Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Western Massachusetts. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in these markets have a significant impact on the ability of borrowers to repay loans. As such, a decline in real estate valuations in these markets would lower the value of the collateral securing those loans. In addition, a significant weakening in general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, or other factors beyond our control could reduce our ability to generate new loans and increase default rates on those loans and otherwise negatively affect our financial results.\nA portion of our loan portfolio is acquired and was not underwritten by us at origination\nAt December 31, 2015, 12% of our loan portfolio was acquired and was not underwritten by us at origination, and therefore is not necessarily reflective of our historical credit risk experience. We performed extensive credit due diligence prior to each acquisition and marked the loans to fair value upon acquisition, with such fair valuation considering expected credit losses that existed at the time of acquisition. Additionally, we evaluate the expected cash flows of these loans on a quarterly basis. However, there is a risk that credit losses could be larger than currently anticipated, thus adversely affecting our earnings. At December 31, 2015, remaining credit marks available to absorb losses on a pool-by-pool basis totaled $62 million, representing a 2% coverage ratio.\nAlmost one-third of our assets are invested in securities, with over 10% of our securities portfolio in collateralized loan obligations, 9% of our portfolio in commercial mortgage-backed securities, 5% of our portfolio in high yield corporate bond securities, and 3% of our portfolio in asset-backed securities\nOur collateralized loan obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities are structured investments with complex formulas to determine the amount of cash flows that get paid to holders of each security type within the various structures. Changes in expected cash flows due to factors such as changing credit experience of the underlying collateral, changes in interest rates or changes in prepayment speeds could affect the amount of interest and principal cash flows we receive and the amount of interest income that we recognize. Additionally, given the structural complexities inherent in these types of securities, there could be cash flow provisions that we may not fully understand. Our high yield corporate bonds are not structured and therefore are susceptible to company specific liquidity and credit risks.\nThe Volcker Rule collateralized loan obligation provisions could result in adverse consequences for us, including lower earnings, lower tangible capital and/or lower regulatory capital\nThe so-called \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act restrict the ability of affiliates of insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, to sponsor or invest in private funds or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading. The Federal Reserve adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule in December, 2013. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the Volcker Rule and the final rules adopted thereunder. We own $0.6 billion of legacy collateralized loan obligation (\"CLO\") securities that we believe are impacted by the Volcker Rule of which $237 million are currently not compliant with that rule that carry a weighted average yield of 3.1%. If we decide to sell or are required to sell these noncompliant securities, our future net interest income could be adversely impacted if our alternative use for these funds yields a lower rate. A 100 basis point reduction in yield upon reinvestment of the noncompliant securities into similar duration securities would result in reduced net interest income of $2 million, or less than one cent per diluted common share.\nWe are evaluating potentially significant price movements in these securities which could adversely impact our tangible capital. For instance, a hypothetical 10% reduction in current CLO market prices would result in a $24 million loss to our current noncompliant CLO securities valuation. Since these securities are currently held as available for sale, the resulting change in Other Comprehensive Income (\"OCI\"), after tax, would be approximately $16 million. Further, if we decide to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell such securities before recovery, we may recognize losses that could adversely impact our regulatory capital ratios. An after tax loss of $16 million would lower regulatory capital ratios by six basis points.\nOur provision for credit losses may be insufficient\nOur customers might not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans might be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Hence, we may experience significant loan losses, which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on loan quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan\nlosses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nOur emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating our allowance for loan losses. As we continue to increase the amount of these loans, additional or increased provisions for credit losses may be necessary and as a result would decrease our earnings.\nBank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe accept deposits that do not have a fixed term and which may be withdrawn by the customer at any time for any reason\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $25.4 billion of deposit liabilities that have no maturity and, therefore, may be withdrawn by the depositor at any time. These deposit liabilities include our checking, savings, and money market deposit accounts.\nMarket conditions may impact the competitive landscape for deposits in the banking industry. The unprecedented low rate environment and future actions the Federal Reserve may take may impact pricing and demand for deposits in the banking industry. Additionally, while we are not currently subject to the LCR or capital surcharges related to reliance on wholesale funding as our total assets are less than $50 billion, the impacts of these may also lead to increased competition for deposits as the larger banks seek to comply with the regulations. In addition to increased competition for deposits in the banking industry, the Merger may have an impact on our ability to retain customer deposits.\nThe withdrawal of more deposits than we anticipate could have an adverse impact on our profitability as this source of funding, if not replaced by similar deposit funding, would need to be replaced with wholesale funding, the sale of interest earning assets, or a combination of these two actions. The replacement of deposit funding with wholesale funding could cause our overall cost of funding to increase, which would reduce our net interest income. A loss of interest earning assets could also reduce our net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be significantly affected by changes in the level of interest rates and the steepness of the yield curve. Our financial results depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. While we have modeled rising interest rate scenarios using historic data and such scenarios result in an increase in our net interest income, our interest-bearing liabilities may reprice or mature more quickly than modeled, thus resulting in a decrease in our net interest income. Further, a flatter yield curve than we modeled would also result in a decline net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our investment securities. Generally, the value of our investment securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Decreases in the fair value of our investment securities, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity or our earnings if the decrease in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the average life of our loans and mortgage related securities. Decreases in interest rates resulting from actions taken by the Federal Reserve has caused an increase in prepayments of our loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. As prepayment speeds on mortgage related securities increase, the premium amortization increases prospectively, and additionally there would be an adjustment required under the application of the interest method of income recognition, and will therefore result in lower net interest income. Under these circumstances, we are also subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable\nto the rates on our existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\nA reduction in the Company's credit rating to below investment grade could adversely impact us or the holders of our securities\nWe are regularly evaluated by ratings agencies. Their ratings are based on their interpretation of a number of factors, including our financial strength and factors outside of our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the broader economy. Following the announcement of the Merger, each of the rating agencies have published updated reports regarding their view of the impact of the Merger on the Company\u2019s credit ratings. During the fourth quarter 2015, Standard and Poor (\u201cS&P\u201d) affirmed the Company\u2019s long term issuer rating of BBB- (which is at the investment grade minimum), but moved their outlook from stable to positive. Similarly in the fourth quarter 2015, Moody\u2019s placed the Company\u2019s ratings on review for upgrade and Fitch placed the Company\u2019s ratings on Rating Watch Positive. Although the rating agencies currently hold positive outlooks for our ratings, there can be no assurances that we will maintain our current ratings and future downgrades could have adverse consequences for us. In addition to a negative perception by our customers, a downgrade of our debt securities could result in adverse price movements of such securities and higher borrowing costs on any debt securities we issue in the future. A rating downgrade of our Company to two notches below investment grade by any rating agency triggers a breach of covenant on our Company's line of credit, resulting in a possibility of limiting our access to that credit line. While this line of credit could potentially be renegotiated to cure the breach, it could result in higher interest and non-usage rates as well as additional fees.\nIf our total consolidated assets were to reach $50 billion, we would become subject to stricter prudential standards required by the Dodd-Frank Act for large bank holding companies\nIn December 2011, the Federal Reserve, pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, proposed rules applying enhanced prudential standards to, among others, bank holding companies having $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The enhanced prudential standards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, risk-management requirements, stress testing of capital, credit limits and early remediation regimes. The final rules also apply certain risk-management and stress testing requirements to bank holding companies like the Company with $10 billion or more but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets. The Dodd-Frank Act permits, but does not require, the Federal Reserve to apply to these institutions heightened prudential standards in a number of other areas, including short-term debt limits and enhanced public disclosure.\nOur total consolidated assets were $39.9 billion at December 31, 2015. If our assets reach the $50 billion threshold, whether driven by organic growth or future acquisitions, we will become subject to the stricter prudential standards required by the Dodd-Frank Act and will incur higher levels of expense to comply with these standards. Moreover, KeyCorp has $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets and, accordingly, if the Merger is completed, we will be part of a larger organization that is subject to these stricter prudential standards.\nSee \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d for more information about the regulations to which we are subject.\nStrong competition may limit our growth and profitability and the pending Merger may intensify this competition\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms (including hedge funds and other private equity investments) operating locally and elsewhere. More recently, peer to peer lending has emerged as an alternative borrowing source for our customers and many other non-banks offer lending and payment services in competition with banks. Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than us and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our ability to successfully compete in our market areas.\nWe also face the risk that our competitors also may seek to use the pending Merger with KeyCorp to target our customers.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain skilled people\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees, and continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of financial institutions. Our compensation plans are an important element in the attraction and retention of key employees. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire these people or to retain them.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things, and the costs of compliance with their regulations are significant. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector. Not all the rules required or expected to be implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted or even proposed, certain of the rules that have been adopted or proposed under the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to phase-in or transitional periods, and many of the rules that have been adopted are subject to interpretation or clarification. The implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for our businesses continue to depend to a large extent on the implementation of the legislation by the Federal Reserve and other agencies as well as how market practices and structures change in response to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nOther changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. For example, since the establishment of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has been focused on numerous consumer-based regulations, the exam focus of our regulators has evolved to include greater scrutiny and annual examinations of previously less reviewed regulations, such as the Servicemember's Civil Relief Act and the Flood Disaster Protection Act. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in civil or criminal sanctions by state and federal agencies, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of our banking charter, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d for more information about the regulations to which we are subject.\nAny future FDIC insurance premium increases may adversely affect our earnings\nThe amount that is assessed by the FDIC for deposit insurance is set by the FDIC based on a variety of factors. These include the DIF\u2019s reserve ratio, the Bank\u2019s assessment base, which is equal to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, and various inputs into the FDIC\u2019s assessment rate calculation, including the Bank\u2019s:\n\u2022\nCAMELS rating,\n\u2022\ncriticized and classified assets,\n\u2022\ncapital levels, including the Tier 1 leverage ratio,\n\u2022\nhigher-risk assets, defined as construction and development loans, leveraged loans and securities, nontraditional mortgages and subprime consumer loans, and higher risk securitizations,\n\u2022\nratio of core earnings to average assets,\n\u2022\nratio of core deposits to total liabilities,\n\u2022\nliquidity ratio (as defined by the FDIC),\n\u2022\nour projected shortfall (in event of failure) between projected insured deposits and the projected assets available to pay off projected insured deposits as a percentage of current domestic deposits,\n\u2022\nbalance sheet composition,\n\u2022\namount of unsecured debt, including subordinated debt and debt issues by another depository institution, and\n\u2022\namount of brokered deposits.\nIf there are additional financial institution failures we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Moreover, in October 2015 the FDIC published for comment a proposed rule that would enable the FDIC to reach the 1.35% DIF reserve ratio by imposing a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The proposed rule could result in a significant additional deposit insurance expense for the Bank and, on a consolidated basis, the Company. Such increases or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely impact our earnings. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Deposit Insurance\u201d for more information about FDIC insurance premiums.\nWe are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt, is dividends from the Bank. The Company's ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is substantially dependent upon the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company. Subject to the Bank meeting or exceeding regulatory capital requirements, the prior approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the Bank's net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. In addition, Federal Reserve guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should not pay dividends in a rolling four quarter period in an amount that exceeds net income for that period. Federal law also prohibits the Bank from paying dividends that would be greater than its undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of its allowance for loan losses.\nThe $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge we recorded in the third quarter of 2014 impacted our regulatory dividend capacity formula. Even though the non-cash goodwill charge did not impact cash flow for dividends, the size of the charge does require that we get regulatory approval from the OCC to make distributions or other returns of capital from the Bank to the Company in the future.\nBased on current estimates, we expect to need quarterly approval from the OCC until the first quarter of 2017 based on their calculation formula. While we cannot be assured that the OCC will approve our quarterly dividend requests going forward, based on conversations with the regulators and barring any unforeseen future developments that would materially impact our profitability, we believe that we can maintain our holding company common and preferred dividend payments at their current levels.\nThe Bank paid dividends of $100 million and $80 million to the Company during 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, the Bank returned capital of $90 million and $85 million to the Company during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIf the Bank is unable to make dividend payments to the Company, and sufficient cash is not otherwise available at the Company, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. See \u201cPayment of Dividends\u201d above under \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nIn addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\nOur goodwill could become impaired again in the future. If our goodwill were to become impaired again, it could further limit the ability of our bank to pay dividends to our holding company, adversely impacting the holding company\u2019s liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt\nThe most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including the sales price of the Company to KeyCorp, the current market price of our common stock, projections of earnings, and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of the Company. We are required to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or between annual impairment tests if a triggering event occurs. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of goodwill will be reduced. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little impact on the tangible book value of our common shares or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2015, the book value of our goodwill was $1.3 billion.\nIn the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge. As discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, the size of the charge impacted our regulatory capacity formula. Negative changes to the assumptions necessary for the determination of the significant estimates used in computing fair value of our Banking reporting unit would result in further impairment. When we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of November 1, 2015, we concluded that our goodwill balance was not impaired.\nA goodwill impairment charge could impact the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company. See Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity Risk\u201d and Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 11. Capital\u201d for further details.\nWe are subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees, or operational errors, including clerical or record keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems or disclosure of confidential proprietary information of our customers. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, sales practices, customer treatment, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by the Company can result in negative public opinion about our other business.\nIf personal, nonpublic, confidential, or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and the large transaction volumes may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and to the risk that we (or our vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to clients, reputational\ndamage, and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, perhaps materially.\nWe may not be able to successfully realize the benefits from our Strategic Investment Plan, which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability\nIn light of the announced Merger with KeyCorp, we have decided to temporarily pause several aspects of the Strategic Investment Plan previously announced in January 2014 and aimed at improved revenue generation and operational efficiencies by improving our feature functionalities and reducing the cost to serve as well as address growing industrywide regulatory imperatives.\nShould the Merger with KeyCorp not be completed, resuming the Strategic Investment Plan may not produce the financial returns or benefits previously contemplated. Timelines and cost estimates may vary materially given the need to re-engage vendors and talent to complete these projects, which may prove to be difficult. Additionally, we may be required to record impairment of assets created by the Strategic Investment Plan if the Merger is not completed and we decide to permanently discontinue some or all aspects of the Strategic Investment Plan.\nWe rely on third-party relationships to conduct our business, which subjects us to strategic, reputation, compliance and transaction (operational) risk\nWe rely on third party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs. Although there are benefits in entering into third party relationships with vendors, there are risks associated with such activities. When entering a third party relationship, the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the third party but remain our responsibility. Management and the Board of Directors are ultimately responsible for the activities conducted by vendors. To that end, Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing vendor relationships. Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place at First Niagara and our vendors to protect the bank and its customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.\nIncreased risk most often arises from poor planning, oversight, and control on the part of the bank and inferior performance or service on the part of the third party, and may result in legal costs or loss of business. While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third party service providers, any problems caused by third party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business. Replacing third party vendors could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses.\nWe are exposed to fraud in many aspects of the services and products that we provide\nWe offer debit cards and credit cards to our banking customers and expanded our online banking and online account opening capabilities in 2014. Historically, we have experienced operational losses from fraud committed by third parties that steal credentials from our customers or merchants utilized by our customers. We have little ability to manage how merchants or our banking customers protect the credentials that our customers have to transact with us. When customers and merchants do not adequately protect customer account credentials, our risks and potential costs increase. As (a) our sales of these services and products expand, (b) those who are committing fraud become more sophisticated and more determined, and (c) our banking services and product offerings expand, our operational losses could increase.\nThere are risks resulting from the complex models we utilize as part of our planning and decision making processes\nLike most banks, we use models for a broad range of activities, including but not limited to: evaluating credit exposures; investment securities, including collateralized mortgage obligation prepayments and refinancing; measuring risk; preparing DFAST capital calculations; deposit behavior to changing rates; and determining capital and adequacy of allowance for loan losses. We have implemented a model risk governance framework and other control procedures commensurate with business activities, and the extent and complexity of the models used considering the materiality of model risk at an individual model level and in the aggregate. While models can\nimprove business decisions, they can also increase our risk profile due to the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on models that are either incorrect or misinterpreted. Such adverse consequences include poor decision making leading to lower revenues, higher expenses (including provisions for loan losses) and inaccurate financial reporting.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or security breach\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure or interruption of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure or interruption will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. A breach in security of our systems, including a breach resulting from our newer online capabilities such as mobile banking, increases the potential for fraud losses. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nAnti-takeover laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect share value\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company without our board of directors' approval. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of a bank holding company. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company, including shares of our common stock or shares of our preferred stock were those shares to become entitled to vote upon the election of two directors because of missed dividends, creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer \u201ccontrols\u201d the bank holding company. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any bank, including the Bank. There also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. Taken as a whole, these statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation could result in the Company being less attractive to a potential acquirer and thus could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFinancial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although management has established business continuity and disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liability when we take title to property\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 85994, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FNFG"}
