{"cik": "1694187", "company": "Neon Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn evaluating the Company and our business, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and in other documents that we file with the SEC. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks described below are not intended to be exhaustive and are not the only risks facing the Company. New risk factors can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict the impact that any factor or combination of factors may have on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Merger with BioNTech SE\nFailure to complete, or delays in completing, the potential merger with BioNTech announced on January 16, 2020 could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, business, financial results and/or stock price.\nOn January 15, 2020, we entered into an agreement with BioNTech pursuant to which, if all of the conditions to closing are satisfied or waived, we will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioNTech. Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, a number of which are not within our control. Any failure to satisfy these required conditions to closing may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the transaction. We cannot predict with certainty whether or when any of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully consummate the proposed merger as currently contemplated under the Merger Agreement or at all.\nOur efforts to complete the Merger could cause substantial disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which may materially adversely affect our results of operation and our business. Uncertainty as to whether the Merger will be completed may affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the transaction is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the transaction. Uncertainty as to our future could adversely affect our business and our relationship with collaborators, suppliers, vendors, regulators and other business partners. For example, vendors, collaborators and other counterparties may defer decisions about working with us or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Changes to, or termination of, existing business relationships could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the transaction could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the transaction or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nRisks related to the failure of the proposed merger to be consummated include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nwe would not realize any or all of the potential benefits of the Merger, including any synergies that could result from combining our financial and proprietary resources with those of BioNTech, which could have a negative effect on our stock price;\n\u2022\nunder some circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee to BioNTech of $3,200,000;\n\u2022\nwe will remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs relating to the Merger regardless of whether the Merger is consummated;\n\u2022\nthe trading price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price for our stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed;\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management and employees may have been diverted to the Merger rather than to our own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nwe could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the Merger as employees and other service providers may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the Merger; and\n\u2022\nunder the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Merger, which restrictions could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as we otherwise would have done if we were not subject to these restrictions.\nThe occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, business, and our stock price.\nWe cannot be sure if or when the Merger will be completed.\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the authorization of the Merger by our shareholders. We cannot guarantee that the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement will be satisfied. If we are unable to satisfy the closing conditions in BioNTech\u2019s favor or if other mutual closing conditions are not satisfied, BioNTech will not be obligated to complete the Merger. Under certain circumstances, we would be required to pay BioNTech a termination fee of $3,200,000.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our board of directors, in discharging its fiduciary obligations to our shareholders, will evaluate other strategic alternatives or financing options that may be available, which alternatives may not be as favorable to our shareholders as the Merger. Any future sale or merger, financing or other transaction may be subject to further shareholder approval. We may also be unable to find, evaluate or complete other strategic alternatives, which may materially adverse affect our business.\nOur efforts to complete the Merger could cause substantial disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which may materially adversely affect our results of operation and our business. Uncertainty as to whether the Merger will be completed may affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the transaction is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the transaction. A substantial amount of our management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention is being directed toward the completion of the transaction and thus is being diverted from our day-to-day operations. Uncertainty as to our future could adversely affect our business and our relationship with collaborators, suppliers, vendors, regulators and other business partners. For example, vendors, collaborators and other counterparties may defer decisions concerning working with us, or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Changes to, or termination of, existing business relationships could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the transaction could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the transaction or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nUntil the Merger is completed, the Merger Agreement restricts BioNTech and us from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party, and, in regards to us, requires us to operate in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. These restrictions may prevent BioNTech and us from making appropriate changes to our respective businesses or pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nBecause the Merger Agreement provides for a fixed exchange ratio for the number of shares of BioNTech ADSs that will be issued for each outstanding share of our common stock, the consideration received at the time of the Merger may be lower than the public trading value of shares of our common stock when we entered into the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement provides for a fixed exchange ratio for the number of shares of BioNTech ADSs that will be issued for each outstanding share of our common stock in the Merger. If the public trading value of shares of BioNTech common stock declines over the period of time required to satisfy the Merger\u2019s closing conditions, the consideration received at the time of the Merger may be lower than the public trading value of shares of our common stock when we entered into the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, could discourage a potential competing acquiror of us from making an alternative transaction proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay a termination fee to BioNTech.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that we shall not, and requires us to refrain from permitting our representatives to, among other things, solicit, participate in negotiations with respect to or approve or recommend any third party proposal for an alternative transaction, subject to exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement relating to the receipt of certain unsolicited proposals. Further, while our board of directors is permitted to make a recommendation change to our stockholders with respect to the Merger under certain circumstances, unless BioNTech terminates the Merger Agreement, we nonetheless will be required to submit the proposals to a stockholder vote at a special meeting. This requirement, which is often called a \u201cforce the vote\u201d provision, means that we do not have the right before the stockholder vote to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay BioNTech a termination fee of $3,200,000.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us or pursuing an alternative transaction from considering or proposing such a transaction, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the consideration in the Merger, or might result in a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner proposing to pay a lower price to our stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger.\nLawsuits may be filed against us and the members of our board of directors arising out of the proposed merger, which may delay or prevent the proposed merger.\nPutative stockholder complaints, including stockholder class action complaints, and other complaints may be filed against us, our board of directors, BioNTech, BioNTech\u2019s board of directors and others in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The outcome of litigation is uncertain, and we may not be successful in defending against any such future claims. Lawsuits that may be filed against us, our board of directors, BioNTech, or BioNTech\u2019s board of directors could delay or prevent the Merger, divert the attention of our management and employees from our day-to-day business and otherwise adversely affect us financially.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Technology and Industry\nWe have incurred net losses in every year since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in the future.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical immuno-oncology company with a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in October 2013. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we reported net losses of $79.8 million and $76.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $253.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with our ongoing activities if, and as, we:\n\u2022\ninitiate or continue clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nadvance our development programs into and through preclinical and clinical development;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022\nhire additional clinical, quality assurance and scientific personnel;\n\u2022\nexpand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to commercialize on our own or jointly with third parties; and\n\u2022\nacquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.\nTo become and remain profitable, we or any potential future collaborator must develop and eventually commercialize products with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining marketing approval for product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling products for which we may obtain marketing approval and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenue that is significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company also could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nEven if we succeed in commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nTo date, we have not generated any product revenue, have a history of losses and will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. If we fail to obtain necessary financing, we will not be able to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since our inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to conduct further research and development and preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies and clinical trials of our current and future programs, to seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates and to launch and commercialize any products for which we receive regulatory approval, including potentially building our own commercial organization. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $29.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2020. However, our future capital requirements and the period for which our existing resources will support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect. We will in any event require additional capital in order to complete clinical development of any of our current programs. Our monthly spending levels will vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any approved\nmarketing and commercialization activities. Our funding requirements, both near and long-term, as well as the timing and amount of our operating expenditures, will depend largely on:\n\u2022\nthe initiation, progress, scope, timing, costs and results of preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe clinical development plans we establish for these product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of product candidates that we develop or may in-license;\n\u2022\nthe terms of any collaboration agreements we may choose to execute;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA, the EMA, the Dutch Health Authority, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including any patent infringement actions that may be brought by third parties in the future against us or our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of formulation development and manufacturing, including the completion of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities; and\n\u2022\nthe cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products on our own.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds or other support for our development efforts and we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Until we can generate sufficient product or royalty revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance our future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing or distribution arrangements. If we raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights. Further, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, your ownership interest will be diluted. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we would be subject to fixed payment obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We also could be required to seek collaborators for one or more of our current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or relinquish our rights to product candidates or technologies that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or product candidates or one or more of our other research and development initiatives. Any of the above events could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs a result of our recurring losses from operations, recurring negative cash flows from operations and substantial cumulative losses, there is uncertainty regarding our ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate our business effectively, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and required additional funding to finance our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate all of our research and development programs or other business activities, and our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. In the future, reports from our independent registered public accounting firm may also contain statements expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur most advanced product candidates are uniquely manufactured for each patient and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to scaling our manufacturing capabilities. If we or any of our third-party manufacturers\nwith whom we contract encounter these types of difficulties, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure.\nThe manufacturing process used to produce our product candidates is complex and novel and has not been validated for clinical or commercial production. For example, for NEO-PTC-01, we will harvest T cells from a patient and then, through a proprietary ex vivo process, prime, activate and expand those T cells to create an autologous T cell therapy that will ultimately be infused back into the patient\u2019s body. Similarly, for NEO-PV-01, we custom design and manufacture up to 20 individually selected peptides with a proprietary formulation to construct a unique vaccine for each patient. As a result of these complexities, the cost to manufacture our product candidates is generally higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds and the manufacturing process is less reliable and is more difficult to reproduce.\nOur manufacturing process will be susceptible to product loss or failure due to logistical issues associated with the collection of a patient\u2019s tumor and blood or other samples, shipping that material to analytical laboratories, and shipping the final product back to the location using cold chain distribution where it will be administered to the patient, manufacturing issues associated with the differences in patient starting materials, interruptions in the manufacturing process, contamination, equipment or reagent failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in cell growth, and variability in product characteristics. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, lot failures, product defects, product delays, product recalls, product liability claims and other supply disruptions. If for any reason we lose a patient\u2019s starting material or one of our custom manufactured products at any point in the process, the manufacturing process for that patient will need to be restarted and the resulting delay may adversely affect that patient\u2019s outcome. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, the manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination, which could result in our inability to produce or ship product. Because our product candidates are manufactured for each particular patient, we will be required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to materials as they move from the patient to the manufacturing facility, through the manufacturing process and back to the patient. Maintaining this type of chain of identity is difficult and complex and the failure to do so could result in adverse patient outcomes, loss of product, or regulatory action, including withdrawal of any approved products from the market. Further, as product candidates are developed through preclinical to later-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered in an effort to optimize processes and results. If we make these types of changes, we may not achieve our intended objectives and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently than we expect, potentially affecting the results of clinical trials.\nAlthough we continually attempt to optimize our manufacturing process, doing so is a difficult and uncertain task and there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for advanced clinical trials or commercialization, including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-out, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency and timely availability of reagents or raw materials. If we are unable to adequately validate or scale-up the manufacturing process with any of our current manufacturers, we will need to transfer to another manufacturer and complete the manufacturing validation process, which can be a lengthy process. We ultimately may not be successful in transferring our production system or the manufacturers on whom we rely may not have the necessary capabilities to complete the implementation and development process. If we are able to adequately validate and scale-up the manufacturing process for our product candidates with a contract manufacturer, we will still need to negotiate an agreement for commercial supply with that contract manufacturer and it is not certain we will be able to come to agreement on terms acceptable to us. As a result, we may ultimately be unable to reduce the cost of goods for our product candidates to levels that will allow for an attractive return on investment if and when those product candidates are approved and commercialized.\nThe manufacturing process for any products that we may develop is subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval processes and we will need to contract with manufacturers who we believe can meet applicable FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis. If we or our CMOs are unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we need to commercialize our products. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance that either we or our CMOs will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications and under required good manufacturing practices acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product, or to meet potential future demand. Any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials, require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidates, impair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur future success depends on our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis with acceptable manufacturing costs, while at the same time maintaining good quality control and complying with applicable regulatory requirements and an inability\nto do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. In addition, we could incur higher manufacturing costs if manufacturing processes or standards change and we could need to replace, modify, design or build and install equipment, all of which would require additional capital expenditures. Specifically, because our product candidates may have a higher cost of goods than conventional therapies and may require long-term follow up evaluations, the risk that coverage and reimbursement rates may be inadequate for us to achieve profitability may be greater.\nWe may in the future evaluate the use of one or more CMOs, as well as the possibility of establishing our own capabilities and infrastructure, including a manufacturing facility. If we were to choose to build our own manufacturing facility, we would need significant funding and would need to select an adequate location. We expect that development of our own manufacturing facility would provide us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, enable the more rapid implementation of process changes and allow for better long-term margins. However, we have no experience in developing a manufacturing facility and may never be successful in developing our own manufacturing facility or capability. If we determine to establish our own manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure, we will also need to hire additional personnel to manage our operations and facilities and develop the necessary infrastructure to continue the research and development and eventual commercialization, if approved, of our product candidates. If we fail to select the correct location, complete the construction in an efficient manner, recruit the required personnel and generally manage our growth effectively, the development and production of our product candidates could be curtailed or delayed. We may establish multiple manufacturing facilities as we expand our commercial footprint to multiple geographies, which may lead to regulatory delays or could prove costly. Even if we are successful, our manufacturing capabilities could be affected by cost-overruns, unexpected delays, equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors that could prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of our manufacturing strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product, together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the relevant agency authorizes its release. Slight deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability, may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. Lot failures or product recalls could cause us to delay product launches or clinical trials, which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Problems in our manufacturing process could restrict our ability to meet market demand for our products.\nWe also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, quality control and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing processes, which could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nAny problems in our manufacturing process or facilities could make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners, including larger pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs.\nOur business is highly dependent on the success of our product candidates. All of our product candidates will require significant additional nonclinical and clinical development before we can seek regulatory approval for and launch a product commercially.\nOur business and future success depend on our ability to obtain regulatory approval of and then successfully launch and commercialize our product candidates. All of our product candidates will require additional clinical and nonclinical development, regulatory review and approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity, and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenue from product sales.\nIn December 2019, we filed a clinical trial authorization with the Dutch Health Authority for our planned trial of NEO-PTC-01 in the Netherlands in patients with metastatic melanoma who are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors. NEO-PTC-01 involves the priming, activation and expansion of neoantigen-specific T cells ex vivo, an approach that may be less effective than anticipated, and our planned clinical trial is subject to risks related to trial execution, including uncertainty of timing or achievement of approval from the Dutch Health Authority to conduct the trial, difficulties with patient enrollment, trial design and establishing trial protocols.\nWe announced in November 2019 that we would cease undertaking new additional spending commitments related to our NEO-PV-01 and NEO-SV-01 programs. NEO-PV-01 is currently being investigated in three Phase 1b clinical trials. We plan to continue to conduct follow-up from our NT-002 clinical trial of NEO-PV-01 in first-line patients with untreated advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and will cease future enrollment in our NT-003 trial in metastatic melanoma. We received approval on an IND submitted to the FDA for NEO-SV-01, a neoantigen vaccine for the treatment of a genetically defined subset of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, but do not currently have plans to initiate a trial of NEO-SV-01. As a result, we currently have fewer active programs and expect that a substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures over the next several years will be devoted to NEO-PTC-01 and NEO-STC-01. Accordingly, our business currently depends heavily on the successful\ndevelopment, regulatory approval, and commercialization of NEO-PTC-01 and NEO-STC-01. We cannot be certain that either of our programs or any future programs will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if we receive regulatory approval. If we were required to discontinue development of our current programs or if they do not receive regulatory approval or fail to achieve significant market acceptance, we would be delayed in our ability to achieve profitability, if ever.\nThe successful development of biopharmaceuticals, such as neoantigen-targeted therapies, is highly uncertain.\nSuccessful development of biopharmaceuticals, such as neoantigen-targeted therapies, is highly uncertain and is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Neoantigen-targeted therapies that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for several reasons including:\n\u2022\nnonclinical or preclinical testing or study results may show the neoantigen-targeted therapies to be less effective than desired or to have harmful or problematic side effects;\n\u2022\nclinical trial results may show the neoantigen-targeted therapies to be less effective than expected (e.g., a clinical trial could fail to meet its primary endpoint(s)) or could have unacceptable side effects or toxicities;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals or experience a delay in receiving those approvals, including delays that may be caused by slow enrollment in clinical trials, patients dropping out of trials, the required length of time to achieve trial endpoints, additional time requirements for data analysis or biologics license application, or BLA, preparation, discussions with the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities , requests from regulatory authorities for additional nonclinical or clinical data, or unexpected safety or manufacturing issues;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing costs, turnaround time, formulation issues, pricing or reimbursement issues, or other factors that make the neoantigen-targeted therapy uneconomical; and\n\u2022\nthe proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies that may prevent the neoantigen-targeted therapy from being commercialized.\nThe length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority may vary significantly from one therapy to the next and may be difficult to predict.\nEven if we are successful in getting market approval for our product candidates, commercial success of any approved products will also depend in large part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and managed care organizations, which may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In order to qualify for reimbursement, third-party payors could require us to conduct additional studies, including post-marketing studies related to the cost effectiveness of a product, which could be costly and divert our resources. If government and other healthcare payors were not to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for any of our products once approved, market acceptance and commercial success would be reduced.\nIn addition, if any of our products is approved for marketing, we will be subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding the submission of safety and other post-marketing information and reports and registration, and will need to continue to comply (or ensure that our third-party providers comply) with cGMPs and GCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, there is always the risk that we or a regulatory authority might identify previously unknown problems with a product post-approval, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency. Compliance with these requirements is costly and any failure to comply or other issues with our product candidates post-approval could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nPreclinical development is uncertain. Our preclinical programs may experience delays or may never advance to clinical trials, which would adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize these programs on a timely basis or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWith the exception of NEO-PV-01, all of our other product candidates are still in the preclinical discovery stage and their risk of failure is high. Before we can commence clinical trials for a product candidate, we must complete extensive preclinical testing and studies that support our planned INDs in the United States, or similar applications in other jurisdictions. We cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcomes of our preclinical testing and studies and cannot predict if the FDA or other regulatory authorities will accept our proposed clinical programs or if the outcomes of our preclinical testing and studies will ultimately support the further development of our programs. As a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit INDs or similar applications for our preclinical programs on the timelines we expect, if at all, and we cannot be sure that submission of INDs or similar applications will result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials to begin.\nFor example, in December 2019 we filed a clinical trial authorization with the Dutch Health Authority for our planned trial of NEO-PTC-01 in the Netherlands in patients with metastatic melanoma who are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors. NEO-\nPTC-01 involves the priming, activation and expansion of neoantigen-specific T cells ex vivo, an approach that may be less effective than anticipated, and our planned clinical trial is subject to risks related to trial execution, including uncertainty of timing or achievement of approval from the Dutch Health Authority to conduct the trial, difficulties with patient enrollment, trial design and establishing trial protocols.\nClinical development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of any product candidates.\nTo obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to commercialize any product candidates, we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our products are safe, pure and potent or effective in humans. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete and the outcome of any clinical trial is inherently uncertain. We may be unable to establish clinical endpoints that applicable regulatory authorities would consider clinically meaningful and a clinical trial can fail at any stage of testing. The outcome of nonclinical studies and early clinical trials, or interim analyses of these trials, may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. For example, our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trials of NEO-PV-01 are open-label and not all enrolled patients have completed these trials. Further, we expect any later-stage clinical trials of NEO-PV-01 will require placebo comparison or comparison with an active comparator. Differences in trial design between early stage clinical trials and later-stage clinical trials make it difficult to extrapolate the results of earlier clinical trials to later clinical trials. Moreover, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in nonclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nSuccessful completion of clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting a BLA to the FDA, a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the EMA, and similar marketing applications to comparable foreign regulatory authorities for each product candidate and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any product candidates. We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin or be completed on schedule, if at all.\nFor example, in December 2019 we filed a clinical trial authorization with the Dutch Health Authority for our planned trial of NEO-PTC-01 in the Netherlands in patients with metastatic melanoma who are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors. NEO-PTC-01 involves the priming, activation and expansion of neoantigen-specific T cells ex vivo, an approach that may be less effective than anticipated, and our planned clinical trial is subject to risks related to trial execution, including uncertainty of timing or achievement of approval from the Dutch Health Authority to conduct the trial, difficulties with patient enrollment, trial design and establishing trial protocols.\nWe may experience delays in completing our preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies and initiating or completing clinical trials. We also may experience numerous unforeseen events or circumstances during, or as a result of, any future clinical trials that we may conduct that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards, or IRBs, or ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable terms with prospective trial sites and prospective CROs as the terms of these agreements can be subject to extensive negotiation and vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of any product candidates may fail to show safety, purity or potency, or produce negative or inconclusive results, which may cause us to decide, or regulators to require us, to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials or which may cause us to decide to abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of any product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipated or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or fail to return for post-treatment follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipated;\n\u2022\nour CROs and other third-party contractors involved in our clinical trials may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or they may deviate from the clinical trial protocol or drop out of the trial, which may require that we add new clinical trial sites or investigators;\n\u2022\nwe may elect to, or regulators, IRBs or ethics committees may require that we or our investigators, suspend or terminate clinical research or trials for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies and clinical trials of any product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe potential insufficiency or inadequacy of the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to manufacture and supply product to patients consistent with clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators, IRBs or ethics committees to suspend or terminate trials, or reports may arise from nonclinical or clinical testing of other cancer therapies that raise safety or efficacy concerns about our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to submit additional data such as long-term toxicology studies, or impose other requirements on us, before permitting us to initiate a clinical trial.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs of the institutions in which these clinical trials are being conducted, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or if a clinical trial is recommended for suspension or termination by the relevant Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB. A suspension or termination may be imposed due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities that results in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product or treatment, failure to establish or achieve clinically meaningful trial endpoints, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. Many of the factors that could cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Further, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials or may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials.\nOur product development costs will increase if we experience delays in conducting clinical testing or receiving marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, potentially impairing our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and harming our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Any delays in our nonclinical or future clinical development programs may harm our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations significantly.\nWe rely on our RECON bioinformatics engine to identify neoantigen targets. Our competitive position could be materially harmed if our competitors develop platforms similar to RECON that they use to develop rival product candidates.\nWe rely on trade secrets, unpatented know-how, inventions and other proprietary information to strengthen our competitive position. We consider know-how to be our primary intellectual property with respect to our RECON (Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology) bioinformatics engine. The algorithms comprising RECON require accurate input data to enable the algorithms to detect patterns. Our clinical trials allow us to collect clinical data together with myriad samples of blood and tumor tissue, which we use as a feedback loop to make improvements to RECON. However, know-how protected by trade secret can be difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that, with respect to this platform, this know-how may over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the method and the movement of skilled personnel.\nWe cannot rule out that our competitors may have or obtain the knowledge necessary to analyze and characterize similar data to our known data for the purpose of identifying and developing products that could compete with our current or future product candidates. Our competitors may also have significantly greater financial, product development, technical and human resources and access to other human tumors than we do. Further, our competitors may have significantly greater experience in using translational science methods to identify and develop product candidates.\nWe may not be able to prohibit our competitors from using technology or methods that are the same as or similar to RECON to develop their own product candidates. If our competitors develop bioinformatics and engage in the computation and analysis of complex algorithms to identify neoantigen targets and develop associated therapies, our ability to develop and market a promising product or product candidate may diminish substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nContinuous and up-to-date clinical data is a key feature of RECON. We cannot guarantee that we will be permitted by regulatory authorities, or have the resources to obtain, continuous clinical data that would be input into RECON. For example, regulatory authorities may require that we refrain from inputting any additional data into RECON after we commence a pivotal clinical trial. If we are prevented or impeded from adding additional clinical data into RECON, we will not be able to advance RECON and its utility may be diminished. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any changes or additions we make to RECON will ultimately result in improved therapeutic outcomes for any product candidates that are generated as a result of RECON. As\na result, our ability to develop product candidates through the use of RECON that provide therapeutic benefit may be significantly impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nOur planned clinical trials or those of our future collaborators may reveal significant adverse events not seen in our preclinical or nonclinical studies and may result in a safety profile that could inhibit regulatory approval or market acceptance of any of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. In addition, initial success in clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained when those trials are completed. There is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety issues, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved as products and there can be no assurance that any of our current or future clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of any of our product candidates.\nCertain of our product candidates will be developed in combination with one or more cancer therapies. This combination may have additional side effects that were not present in initial clinical trials of our product candidates with other cancer therapies. The uncertainty resulting from the use of our product candidates in combination with other cancer therapies may make it difficult to accurately predict side effects in future clinical trials.\nIf significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our current or future clinical trials, we may have difficulty recruiting patients to our clinical trials, patients may drop out of our trials, or we may be required to abandon the trials or our development efforts of one or more product candidates altogether. We, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, or an IRB, may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that trial subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects. Some potential therapeutics developed in the biotechnology industry that initially showed therapeutic promise in early-stage trials have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Even if the side effects presented do not preclude the drug from obtaining or maintaining marketing approval, undesirable side effects may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its tolerability versus other therapies. Any of these developments could materially harm our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe patient eligibility and exclusion criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of patients to trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe design of the trial;\n\u2022\nthe ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion.\nIn addition, our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are similar therapeutic areas as our product candidates, which may reduce the number and types of patients available to us. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials at those sites. Moreover, because our product candidates represent a departure from more commonly used methods for cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, rather than enroll patients in a clinical trial. This may be particularly true for patients with late-stage disease who may perceive that our approach is not effective for patients with that disease profile.\nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trials. These delays could also prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates.\nWe expect to develop some of our product candidates in combination with other therapies, and safety or supply issues with combination use products may delay or prevent development and approval of our product candidates.\nWe intend to develop some of our product candidates in combination with one or more approved or unapproved cancer therapies.\nEven if any product candidate we develop were to receive marketing approval or be commercialized for use in combination with other existing therapies, we would continue to be subject to the risks that the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States could revoke approval of the therapy used in combination with our product or that safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with any of those existing therapies. If the therapies we use in combination with our product candidates are replaced as the standard of care for the indications we choose for any of our product candidates, the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States may require us to conduct additional clinical trials. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in our own products, if approved, being removed from the market or being less successful commercially.\nWe may also evaluate some of our product candidates in combination with one or more cancer therapies that have not yet been approved for marketing by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. We will not be able to market and sell any product candidate we develop in combination with an unapproved cancer therapy if that unapproved cancer therapy does not ultimately obtain marketing approval. In addition, unapproved cancer therapies face the same risks described with respect to our product candidates currently in development and clinical trials, including the potential for serious adverse effects, delay in their clinical trials and lack of FDA approval.\nIf the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States do not approve these other drugs or revoke their approval of, or if safety, efficacy, manufacturing, or supply issues arise with, the drugs we choose to evaluate in combination with our product candidates , we may be unable to obtain approval of or market those product candidates.\nNeoantigen-targeted therapies are a novel approach and negative perception of the efficacy or safety of any of our product candidates could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nNeoantigen-targeted therapies remain novel and unproven technologies, with no neoantigen-targeted therapy approved to date in the U.S. or EU. Neoantigen T cell therapies, neoantigen vaccines or any other modality that we seek to use may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. For example, earlier cancer vaccines attempted to direct the immune system against a class of molecules found predominantly, but not exclusively, at the tumor site. Since the targets of these cancer vaccines were are also found on normal cells, they were regarded as \u2018self\u2019, which caused the immune system to prohibit destruction of the cancerous cells. As a result, these cancer vaccines did not generate potent immune responses. Our neoantigen vaccines may be perceived to face the same challenges as the earlier cancer vaccines, which could limit our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials or if approved, negatively impact our vaccines\u2019 market acceptance. Further, with respect to our NEO-PTC-01 program, the use of T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent scientific development and may not become broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers and others in the medical community.\nOur success will depend upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of diseases targeted by our product candidates prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are more familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. Adverse events in clinical trials of our product candidates or in clinical trials of others developing similar products and the resulting publicity, as well as any other adverse events in the field of neoantigen-targeted therapies cancer vaccines, or T cell therapies, could result in a decrease in demand for any product that we may develop. In addition, responses by the U.S., state or foreign governments to negative public perception may result in new legislation or regulations that could limit our ability to develop or commercialize any product candidates, obtain or maintain regulatory approval or otherwise achieve profitability. More restrictive statutory regimes, government regulations or negative public opinion would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop.\nNEO-PV-01, our personal neoantigen-based cancer vaccine product candidate, includes a development-stage vaccine adjuvant, poly-ICLC. It is difficult for us to predict how our use of poly-ICLC will be viewed by the FDA or other regulatory agencies as we attempt to demonstrate the safety of NEO-PV-01.\nWe use an adjuvant, poly-ICLC, with our NEO-PV-01 vaccine product candidate, which makes it difficult to predict how the FDA and applicable other regulatory agencies will evaluate the safety of NEO-PV-01. Adjuvants are compounds that are added to vaccines to enhance the activation of and improve the immune response and efficacy of vaccines. Any vaccine, because of the presence of an adjuvant, may have side effects that may pose too great a safety risk to warrant approval of the vaccine. Development-\nstage vaccine adjuvants, such as poly-ICLC, may pose an increased safety risk to patients. Poly-ICLC has been used as an adjuvant in other investigational vaccine trials but has never been approved by the FDA for commercial use. The existence of additional trials using this adjuvant may provide support for approval of our product candidates, however, negative safety or efficacy results from other trials using poly-ICLC could similarly jeopardize the continued development of our product candidates that use poly-ICLC as an adjuvant.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our research and development activities involve the use of biological and hazardous materials and produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, as well as environmental damage that could result in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these types of materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these types of materials. In the event of any contamination or injury, we may be held liable for any resulting damages in an amount that could potentially exceed our resources, and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of changes to applicable laws and regulations and cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not carry specific biological waste or hazardous waste insurance coverage or workers compensation or property and casualty and general liability insurance policies that include coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates if we face product liability lawsuits.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of testing our product candidates in clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if our product candidates cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing or sale. We could face product liability claims that may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. In addition, we could face claims asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims or state consumer protection claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even the successful defense against a claim of this nature would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, claims of liability of this nature may result in:\n\u2022\nour inability to bring a product candidate to the market or commercialize any product candidate;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants and inability to continue clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u2022\nthe withdrawal of IRB approval for the conduct of clinical trials using our product candidates; and\n\u2022\na decline in our share price.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop, alone or with collaborators. Even if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against losses, that indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise. Although we currently carry $10.0 million in clinical trial insurance, that amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate and, in the future, we may be unable to maintain this insurance coverage or we may not be able to obtain additional or replacement insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay those amounts.\nThe market opportunities for our product candidates may be limited or small.\nThe potentially addressable patient population for our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates. In addition, our projections of both the number of people who have the cancers we are targeting, as well as the subset of people with these cancers in a position to receive our therapies, if approved, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these cancers. The number of potential patients for our product candidates may turn out to be lower than expected. Even if we obtain significant market share for our product candidates, if the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and well-established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel therapeutics or to in-license novel therapeutics that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further due to advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug or biologic products that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized or less costly than our product candidates, or they may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, convenience of use, price and reimbursement.\nWe anticipate competing with the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, many of which are conducting research in neoantigen based therapies and all of which have greater financial and human resources than we currently have. In addition to these fully-integrated biopharmaceutical companies, we will also face competition from other immunotherapy-focused oncology companies. Further, we directly compete with a number of neoantigen therapeutics-focused companies, some of whom are developing vaccines, while others are developing T cell therapies and/or T cell receptor-based therapies. These competitors include Aduro Biotech, Inc., Achilles Therapeutics Limited, Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, Adaptive Biosciences, Inc., Adicet Bio, Inc., Advaxis, Inc., Agenus Inc., AgenTus Therapeutics, Inc., BioNTech SE, bluebird bio, Inc., Celgene Corporation, Genocea Biosciences, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Gritstone Oncology, Inc., Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH, IMV Inc., Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc., ISA Pharmaceuticals, B.V., Lion TCR Pte. Ltd., Marker Therapeutics, Inc., Medigene AG, Moderna, Inc., Nouscom AG, PACT Pharma, Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., TScan Therapeutics, Inc., Vaccibody AS, Zelluna Immunotherapy AS and ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. For further information on our potential merger with one of our competitors, BioNTech SE, please see section above titled \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Merger with BioNTech.\"\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, the availability and price of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our product candidates. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our product candidates is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from\nexisting methods of treatment to our product candidates, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products or choose to reserve our product candidates for use in limited circumstances.\nEven if a product candidate we develop receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any product candidate we develop receives marketing approval, whether as a single agent or in combination with other therapies, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. For example, other cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are well established in the medical community and doctors may continue to rely on these therapies. If the product candidates we develop do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of any product candidate, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nefficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nprice competitiveness;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement, including with respect to the use of the approved product as a combination therapy;\n\u2022\nadoption of a companion diagnostic and/or complementary diagnostic; and\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects.\nWe may need to grow the size of our organization and we may experience difficulties identifying and hiring the right employees and in managing this growth.\nAlthough we announced in November 2019 a 24% reduction in our headcount, it is possible that, in the future, we may experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of technology research, product development and manufacturing, regulatory affairs and, if any product candidates are submitted for or receive marketing approval, sales, marketing and distribution. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees;\n\u2022\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical and FDA review process for our product candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and\n\u2022\nimproving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates may depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.\nWe currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors, contractors and consultants to provide certain services, including substantially all aspects of regulatory approval, clinical management and manufacturing. There can be no assurance that the services of independent organizations, advisors, contractors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed or that we will be able to find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by independent organizations, advisors, contractors or consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates or otherwise advance our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing independent organizations, advisors, contractors or consultants or find other competent resources on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding the roster of independent organizations, advisors and consultants on whom we rely on an outsourced basis, we may not be able successfully to implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nOur corporate restructuring and the associated headcount reduction announced in November 2019 may not result in anticipated savings, could result in total costs and expenses and attrition that are greater than expected and could disrupt our business.\nOn November 20, 2019, we announced a 24% reduction in headcount as part of a corporate restructuring. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our cost structure from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from the restructuring, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We also cannot guarantee that we will not have to undertake additional headcount reductions or restructuring activities in the future. Furthermore, our restructuring activities may be disruptive to our operations. For example, our headcount reductions could yield unanticipated consequences, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions, or increase difficulties in our day-to-day operations. Our headcount reductions could also harm our ability to attract and retain qualified management, scientific, clinical, manufacturing and other personnel who are critical to our business. Any failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could prevent us from successfully developing and commercializing our product candidates in the future.\nIf we lose key management personnel, or if we fail to retain or recruit additional highly skilled personnel, our ability to identify and develop new or next generation product candidates will be impaired, could result in loss of markets or market share and could make us less competitive.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our management, scientific and medical personnel. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, other key employees and other scientific and medical advisors and our inability to find suitable replacements could result in delays in product development and harm our business.\nWe conduct our operations at our facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This region is home to many other biopharmaceutical companies and many academic and research institutions and competition for skilled personnel in our market is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nAdditionally, while we put in place retention arrangements at the time we effected our November 2019 corporate restructuring, the combination of having effected that restructuring and the January 2020 announcement of the planned acquisition of our company by BioNTech announced in January 2020 may make it increasingly difficult for us to retain our executive officers, other key employees and other scientific and medical advisors.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Although we have employment agreements with certain of our key employees, these employment agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. We do not maintain \"key man\" insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level and senior managers, as well as junior, mid-level and senior scientific and medical personnel.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of our CROs, CMOs and other independent organizations, advisors, contractors and consultants, could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce and process our product candidates on a patient-by-patient basis. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of our product candidates could be disrupted if the operations of the suppliers of these materials are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption.\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns could seriously harm our development efforts and increase our costs and expenses.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our ongoing or planned research and development activities. For example, in December 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States. To date, this outbreak has already resulted in extended shutdowns of certain businesses in the Wuhan region and has had ripple effects to businesses around the world. Global health concerns, such as coronavirus, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we or the third parties with whom we engage operate. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the suppliers, clinical trial sites, regulators and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our\nbusiness in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted. It is also possible that global health concerns such as this one could disproportionately impact the hospitals and clinical sites in which we conduct any of our clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operation and financial condition.\nOur internal computer systems, or those used by our CROs or other independent organizations, advisors, contractors or consultants, may be subject to cyber-attacks, fail or suffer security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other independent organizations, advisors, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Because information systems, networks, web tools and other technologies are critical to many of our operating activities, shutdowns or service disruptions at our company or vendors that provide information systems, networks, web tools or other services to us pose increasing risks. Disruptions of this nature may be caused by events such as computer hacking, phishing attacks, ransomware, dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity, as well as power outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist attacks or other similar events. In addition, outside parties may attempt to penetrate our systems or those of our vendors or fraudulently induce our personnel or the personnel of our vendors to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data and/or systems. Like other companies, we have on occasion experienced, and will continue to experience, threats and incursions to our data and systems, including malicious codes and viruses, phishing, business email compromise attacks or other cyber-attacks. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. While we have not experienced any material system failure or security breach to date, if an event of that nature were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Additionally, a security breach related to RECON\u2019s proprietary combination of algorithms could adversely affect our ability to apply RECON to predict therapeutically-relevant neoantigens or result in our competitors having access to these algorithms, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Likewise, we currently, and may in the future continue to, rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and to conduct clinical trials and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our internal computer systems or those used by our CROs or other independent organizations, advisors, contractors or consultants, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, suffer reputational harm and experience delays in the further development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to respond to these threats or breaches and to repair or replace information systems or networks. We also could suffer financial loss or the loss of valuable confidential information. In addition, we could be subject to regulatory actions and/or claims made by individuals and groups in private litigation involving privacy issues related to data collection and use practices and other data privacy laws and regulations, including claims for misuse or inappropriate disclosure of data, as well as unfair or deceptive practices. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events from occurring and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely and there can be no assurance that any measures we take will prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches that could adversely affect our business.\nContinued uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit may cause increased economic volatility, affecting our operations and business.\nIn March 2017, the United Kingdom served notice to the European Council under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon to withdraw membership from the EU. Such exit (Brexit) could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business in the UK and EU, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers, and employees. As a result, Brexit could have an adverse effect on our future business, financial results, and operations. The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, and is now in a transition period through December 31, 2020. Although the UK will remain in the EU single market and customs union during the transition period, the long-term nature of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU is unclear and there is considerable uncertainty any agreement will be reached and implemented. The political and economic instability created by Brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the UK. In particular, although the UK enacted a Data Protection Act in May 2018 that is consistent with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the UK, the EU, and elsewhere. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects\non the economy of the UK and the other economies. There can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct that fails to comply with the laws enforced by the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies, provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the United States and similar foreign laws, or report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. If we obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our potential exposure under these laws will increase significantly and our costs associated with compliance with these laws are also likely to increase. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with principal investigators and research patients, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers and physicians and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufactures to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, or the FCA, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which companies sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating this statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil \"qui tam\" or \"whistleblower\" actions, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to \"cause\" the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a \"whistleblower\" to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or\nproperty owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;\n\u2022\nfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and may be broader in scope than their U.S. federal equivalents; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThe distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company\u2019s attention from the business.\nThe failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects entities to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, our failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause a pharmaceutical manufacturer to incur significant legal expenses and divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of the business. Prohibitions, restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer\u2019s business in an adverse way.\nWe have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, a copy of which is available on the Investors section of our website. However, even after adopting and implementing appropriate corporate policies, it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent inappropriate conduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming\nfrom a failure to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations. Our efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any actions of this nature are instituted against us and if we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our product candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify additional product candidates. Due to our limited resources and access to capital, we must prioritize development of certain product candidates; these decisions may prove to be wrong and may adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we intend to explore therapeutic opportunities beyond those that we are currently developing, we may fail to identify viable new product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, which could result in harm to our business.\nResearch programs to pursue the development of our existing and planned product candidates for additional indications and to identify new product candidates and disease targets require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not they are ultimately successful. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential indications and/or product candidates, yet fail to yield results for clinical development for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe research method used may not be successful in identifying potential indications and/or product candidates;\n\u2022\npotential product candidates may, after further study, be shown to have harmful adverse effects or other characteristics that indicate they are unlikely to be effective therapies; or\n\u2022\nit may take greater human and financial resources than we will possess to identify additional therapeutic opportunities for our product candidates or to develop suitable potential product candidates through internal research programs, thereby limiting our ability to develop, diversify and expand our product portfolio.\nBecause we have limited financial and human resources, we intend to initially focus on research programs and product candidates for a limited set of indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential or a greater likelihood of success. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to identify additional therapeutic opportunities for our product candidates or develop suitable potential product candidates through internal research programs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential product candidates or other potential programs that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of risks associated with marketing our product candidates internationally.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, if we obtain necessary approvals, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries, including with respect to privacy restrictions and the sharing of patient information;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nimport and export regulations;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\npotential liability under the FCPA or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u2022\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no organizational experience marketing products. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities and have no organizational experience marketing products. In the future, we may determine to develop an in-house marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. We will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel.\nIn addition to establishing internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain these types of collaborative arrangements, or if we are able to do so, that our partners will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive from collaboration partners will depend upon the efforts of these third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts that these third parties undertake and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to commercialize any, assuming they receive regulatory approval, in the United States or overseas.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could substantially increase our development costs.\nA portion of our planned clinical trial activities and clinical product manufacturing are conducted outside of the United States, and associated costs may be incurred in the local currency of the country in which the activity is being conducted, which costs could be subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. At present, we do not engage in hedging transactions to protect against uncertainty in future exchange rates between particular foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against currencies in geographies in which we conduct clinical trials or manufacturing activities could have a negative impact on our research and development costs. We cannot predict the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and foreign currency fluctuations in the future may adversely affect our development costs.\nChanges in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe laws and rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are routinely reviewed and modified by governmental bodies, officials and regulatory agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. Since the Company was founded in 2014, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, in December 2017, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, was significantly reformed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA. Changes under the TCJA included, among other things, a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, significant limitations on the deductibility of interest and net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, the ability to expense capital expenditures, and the migration from a \"worldwide\" system of taxation to a territorial system. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued, that could result in an increase in our or our shareholders\u2019 tax liability.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and research and development credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $153.9 million of which $79.1 million will begin to expire in 2034 and $74.8 million of which can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had state net operating loss carryforwards of $155.2 million, which begin to expire in 2034. As of December 31, 2019, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $7.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2034 and 2029, respectively. Under the TCJA, net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017 are\nnot subject to expiration. Our ability to utilize our net operating losses or tax credits, or NOLs or credits, is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating U.S. federal and state taxable income. As described above under \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business, Technology and Industry,\" we have incurred significant net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. In addition, in general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \"ownership change\" is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs or credits to offset future taxable income or taxes. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation\u2019s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and we expect to experience an ownership change in the future as a result of the proposed acquisition of the Company by BioNTech (as discussed above under \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Merger with BioNTech\"). Our NOLs or credits may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, we do not know whether or when we will utilize our NOL or credit carryforwards.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe regulatory approval process for our product candidates in the United States, European Union and other jurisdictions is currently uncertain and will be lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable and we may experience significant delays in the clinical development and regulatory approval, if any, of our product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products, including biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and regulatory authorities in states and other countries. We are not permitted to market any biological product in the United States until we receive a biologics license from the FDA. We have not previously submitted a BLA to the FDA, or similar marketing application to comparable foreign authorities. A BLA must include extensive nonclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish that the product candidate is safe, pure and potent for each desired indication. The BLA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product, and the manufacturing facilities must complete a successful pre-license inspection. We expect the novel nature of our product candidates to create further challenges in obtaining regulatory approval. For example, the personal T cell and vaccine product candidates that we design and manufacture are molecularly different for each patient and the FDA has not approved any personal neoantigen therapies to date. Similarly, we use data from our clinical trials to continuously improve the algorithms composing our RECON bioinformatics engine. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may require that we refrain from inputting any additional data into our RECON bioinformatics engine before we commence any pivotal clinical trials of our product candidates. As a result, our ability to develop product candidates and obtain regulatory approval may be significantly impacted.\nThe FDA may also require a panel of experts, referred to as an Advisory Committee, to deliberate on the adequacy of the safety and efficacy data to support approval. The opinion of the Advisory Committee, although not binding, may have a significant impact on our ability to obtain approval of any product candidates that we develop based on the completed clinical trials.\nMoreover, while we are not aware of any specific genetic or biomarker diagnostic tests for which regulatory approval would be necessary in order to advance any of our product candidates to clinical trials or potential commercialization, in the future, regulatory agencies may require the development and approval of these types of tests. Accordingly, the regulatory approval pathway for our product candidates may be uncertain, complex, expensive and lengthy, and we may never obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nIn addition, clinical trials can be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including delays or failures related to:\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory authorization to begin a trial;\n\u2022\nthe availability of financial resources to begin and complete the planned trials;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nobtaining approval at each clinical trial site by an independent IRB or ethics committee;\n\u2022\nrecruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nhaving patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\ndeviations from trial protocols by clinical trial sites, noncompliance with GCP requirements or clinical trial sites dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\naddressing any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u2022\naddressing any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nadding new clinical trial sites; or\n\u2022\nmanufacturing qualified materials under cGMP regulations for use in clinical trials.\nIn December 2019, we filed a clinical trial authorization with the Dutch Health Authority for our planned trial of NEO-PTC-01 in the Netherlands in patients with metastatic melanoma who are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors. NEO-PTC-01 involves the priming, activation and expansion of neoantigen-specific T cells ex vivo, an approach that may be less effective than anticipated, and our planned clinical trial is subject to risks related to trial execution, including uncertainty of timing or achievement of approval from the Dutch Health Authority to conduct the trial, difficulties with patient enrollment, trial design and establishing trial protocols.\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of commencement and completion of trials and can be affected by many factors. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs for the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or a clinical trial may be recommended for suspension or termination by the applicable DSMB, due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience termination of, or delays in the completion of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing any clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may disagree with our regulatory plan and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe general approach for FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority approval of a new biologic or drug is to provide dispositive data from two well-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials of the relevant biologic or drug in the relevant patient population. Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve hundreds of patients, have significant costs and take years to complete. We believe that we may be able to utilize an accelerated approval approach for our product candidates given the limited alternatives for cancer treatments, but the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may not agree with our plans.\nIn addition, our clinical trials results may also not support approval of our product candidates. Our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that our product candidates are safe and effective for any of their proposed indications;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that our product candidates\u2019 clinical and other benefits outweigh their safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may be deemed by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to be insufficient to support the submission of a BLA or other comparable submission in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve or find deficiencies with the manufacturing processes and controls or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies or any facilities that we may own in the future; and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner that could render our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nFor example, in December 2019 we filed a clinical trial authorization with the Dutch Health Authority for our planned trial of NEO-PTC-01 in the Netherlands in patients with metastatic melanoma who are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors. NEO-PTC-01 involves the priming, activation and expansion of neoantigen-specific T cells ex vivo, an approach that may be less effective than anticipated, and our planned clinical trial is subject to risks related to trial execution, including uncertainty of timing or achievement of approval from the Dutch Health Authority to conduct the trial, difficulties with patient enrollment, trial design and establishing trial protocols.\nWe may rely on third parties to conduct investigator-sponsored clinical trials of our product candidates. Any failure by a third party to meet its obligations with respect to the clinical development of our product candidates may delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our other product candidates.\nWe may rely on academic and private, non-academic institutions to conduct and sponsor clinical trials relating to our product candidates. We will not control the design or conduct of these investigator-sponsored trials. It is possible that the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities will not view these investigator-sponsored trials as providing adequate support for future clinical trials, whether controlled by us or third parties, for any one or more reasons, including due to elements of the design or execution of the trials, safety concerns or other trial results.\nOur arrangements with academic and private, non-academic institutions will likely provide us certain information rights with respect to the investigator-sponsored trials, including access to and the ability to use and reference the data resulting from the investigator-sponsored trials, including for our own regulatory filings. However, we would not have control over the timing and reporting of the data from investigator-sponsored trials, nor would we own the data from the investigator-sponsored trials. If we are unable to confirm or replicate the results from investigator-sponsored trials or if those trials produce negative results, we would likely be further delayed or prevented from advancing further clinical development of our product candidates. Further, if investigators or institutions breach their obligations with respect to the clinical development of our product candidates, or if the data they generate prove to be inadequate compared to the first-hand knowledge we might have gained had their trials instead been sponsored and conducted by us, then our ability to design and conduct any future clinical trials ourselves may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree with the sufficiency of our right of reference to the preclinical, manufacturing or clinical data generated by these investigator-sponsored trials, or our interpretation of preclinical, manufacturing or clinical data from these investigator-sponsored trials. If so, the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may require us to obtain and submit additional preclinical, manufacturing, or clinical data before we may initiate our planned trials and/or may not accept such additional data as adequate to initiate our planned trials.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of a product candidate in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for that product candidate in any other jurisdiction, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical trials conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to regulatory approval.\nWe may also submit marketing applications in other countries. Regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States have requirements for approval of product candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing our product candidates in those jurisdictions. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval of any product candidates or therapies, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing studies and submission of safety, efficacy and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, we will be subject to continued compliance with cGMP and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.\nManufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, and in certain cases, current Good Tissue Practices, or cGTP, regulations. As a result, we and our contract manufacturers, including our outsourced peptide manufacturer and vaccine adjuvant supplier, will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with\ncGMP and adherence to commitments made in any BLA, other marketing application, and previous responses to inspection observations. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The FDA may also require that we implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, program as a condition of approval of our product candidates, which could entail requirements for long-term patient follow-up, a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves our product candidates, we will have to comply with requirements including submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports and establishment registration.\nThe FDA may seek consent decrees or withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our products, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022\nfines, warning or untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of license approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. The policies of the FDA and of other regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nCoverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, if approved, which could make it difficult for us to sell any product candidates or therapies profitably.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health care programs, private health insurers, and other organizations. Third-party payors decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments. Sales of these or other product candidates that we may identify will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors. If coverage and adequate reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.\nThird-party payors decide which drugs and treatments they will cover and the amount of reimbursement. There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial\ndegree. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022\nsafe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022\ncost-effective; and\n\u2022\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nIn the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products, with no assurance that the payor would agree to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS. For example, a number of cancer drugs have been approved for reimbursement in the United States and have not been approved for reimbursement in certain European countries. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale, and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products we may develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize product candidates, and our overall financial condition. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, third-party payors may not cover, or provide adequate reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of product candidates. Patients are unlikely to use our product candidates unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our product candidates. Because our product candidates may have a higher cost of goods than conventional therapies and may require long-term follow up evaluations, the risk that coverage and reimbursement rates may be inadequate for us to achieve profitability may be greater. There is significant uncertainty related to insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.\nPayment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation, regulatory initiatives and judicial challenges. For example, in order for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures are expected to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures and therefore may affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause public and private payor organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs, and the current administration recently released a \"Blueprint,\" or plan, to reduce the cost of drugs. The current administrations\u2019 Blueprint contains certain measures that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is already working to implement. In May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS\u2019s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. While some proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on September 25, 2019, the Senate Finance Committee introduced the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Action of 2019, a bill intended to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug prices. The proposed legislation would restructure the Part D benefit, modify payment methodologies for certain drugs, and impose an inflation cap on drug price increases. An even more restrictive bill, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 19, 2019, and would require HHS to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers.\nThe Lower Drugs Costs Now Act of 2019 has passed out of the House and was delivered to the Senate on December 16, 2019. However, it is unclear whether either of these bills will make it through both chambers and be signed into law, and if either is enacted, what effect it would have on our business. Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nAt the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, cost containment initiatives and additional legislative changes.\nOngoing healthcare legislative and regulatory reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any changes of this nature were to be imposed on us, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.\nIn the United States, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; addresses a new method by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs; and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (increased pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, administrative, executive and Congressional legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example. various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing constitutional challenges in the Fifth Circuit Court and the United States Supreme Court, and the Trump Administration has issued various Executive Orders eliminating cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Additionally, Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended, and we cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2029, unless additional congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers. In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.\nThese laws, and state and federal healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and/or otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates\nfor which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such approved product candidate is prescribed or used. Litigation and legislative efforts to change or repeal the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.\nEuropean Union drug marketing and reimbursement regulations may materially affect our ability to market and receive coverage for our products in the European member states.\nWe intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in both the United States and in selected foreign jurisdictions. If we obtain approval for our product candidates in one or more foreign jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions. In some foreign countries, particularly those in the European Union, or the EU, the pricing of biologics is subject to governmental control and other market regulations that could put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after obtaining marketing approval of a product candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures.\nMuch like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.\nPayments made to physicians in certain European Union member states must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct that are applicable in the European Union member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.\nIn addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.\nThe requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of any of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and, generally, prices tend to be significantly lower in the European Union. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues from sales by us or our strategic partners and the potential profitability of any of our product candidates in those countries would be negatively affected.\nEuropean data collection is governed by restrictive regulations governing the use, processing and cross-border transfer of personal information.\nThe collection and use of personal health data in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data, and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Since we anticipate beginning our NEO-PTC-01 program in the\nNetherlands, our operations in the EU may be subject to the GDPR. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with these and/or new data protection rules. We may be required to obtain additional consent to process and transfer data outside the EU, which may affect our ability to enroll enough patients in our trials. These regulations may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nAdditional laws and regulations governing international operations may preclude us from developing, manufacturing or selling certain products and product candidates outside the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nIf we expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, we will need to dedicate additional resources to complying with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations. We can face serious consequences for violations.\nAmong other matters, U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, which are collectively referred to as the Trade Laws, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of the Trade Laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. We also expect our non-U.S. activities to increase in time, including when and if we conduct clinical trials outside the United States. We plan to engage third parties for clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations and other regulatory approvals and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. It is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights and technology and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part on obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection of our proprietary technologies and product candidates, their respective components, formulations, combination therapies, methods used to manufacture them and methods of treatment, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. If we are unable to secure and maintain patent protection for any product or technology we develop or if the scope of the patent\nprotection secured is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours and our ability to commercialize any product candidates we may develop may be adversely affected.\nThe patenting process is expensive and time-consuming and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all relevant markets. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties and are reliant on our licensors or licensees. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in issued patents that protect our technology or products, in whole or in part. In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technology or from developing competing products and technologies.\nWe depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties and termination of any of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business.\nWe are dependent on patents, know-how and proprietary technology, both our own and those licensed from others. As a result, any termination of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nDisputes may also arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nwhether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nour right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product candidates and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; and\n\u2022\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nWe are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of intellectual property that we license, as we are for intellectual property that we own, which are described below. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to commercialize products could suffer.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our patent licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to license agreements with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc., the Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and others, pursuant to which we in-license key patent and patent applications for our product candidates. These existing licenses impose various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to develop or market the products covered by the intellectual property licensed under these agreements.\nWe have limited control over the maintenance and prosecution of these in-licensed patents and patent applications and may have limited control over other intellectual property that may be in-licensed. For example, we cannot be certain that the maintenance and prosecution activities by these licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights. We also have limited control over the manner in which our licensors initiate an infringement proceeding against a third-party infringer of the intellectual property rights or defend certain of the intellectual property that is licensed to us. It is possible that the licensors\u2019 infringement proceedings or defense activities may be less vigorous than had we conducted them ourselves.\nOur proprietary position depends upon patents that are manufacturing, formulation or method-of-use patents, which may not prevent a competitor or other third party from using the same product candidate for another use.\nComposition-of-matter patents on the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in prescription drug products are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for drug products because those types of patents provide protection without regard to any particular method of use or manufacture or formulation of the API used. We do not currently have\nany claims in our owned or in-licensed issued U.S. patents that cover the composition-of-matter of any of our product candidates. We are, however, pursuing claims in our pending owned or in-licensed patent applications that cover the composition-of-matter of our product candidates. We cannot be certain that claims in any future patents issuing from our pending owned or in-licensed patent applications or our future owned or in-licensed patent applications will cover the composition-of-matter of our current or future product candidates. In addition, there are likely to be additional challenges in obtaining composition-of-matter patents for our current and future personal T cell and vaccine product candidates, given the highly bespoke nature of our personalized therapies.\nMethod-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method and formulation patents cover formulations of the API. These types of patents do not prevent a competitor or other third party from developing or marketing an identical product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method or from developing a different formulation that is outside the scope of the patented formulation. Moreover, with respect to method-of-use patents, even if competitors or other third parties do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications or uses for which we may obtain patents, physicians may recommend that patients use these products off-label, or patients may do so themselves. Although off-label use may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and this type of infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. In addition, there are numerous publications and other prior art that may be relevant to our owned and in-licensed formulation and method-of-use patents and may be used to challenge the validity of these owned or in-licensed patents in litigation or other intellectual property-related proceedings. If these types of challenges are successful, our owned and in-licensed patents may be narrowed or found to be invalid and we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, prospects and results of operations.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or uses thereof in the United States or in foreign countries. Even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in those patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and threaten our ability to commercialize, our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, at any moment in time, we cannot be certain that we were in the past or will be in the future the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Furthermore, for our United States patent applications in which all claims are entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013, a third party can invoke, or the United States patent office, or USPTO, can institute an interference proceeding to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims included in our applications.\nWe cannot be certain that we are the first to invent the inventions covered by pending patent applications and, if we are not, we may be subject to priority disputes. We may be required to disclaim part or all of the term of certain patents or all of the term of certain patent applications. There may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim. There also may be prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a claim. No assurance can be given that, if challenged, our patents would be declared by a court to be valid or enforceable or that even if found valid and enforceable, a competitor\u2019s technology or product would be found by a court to infringe our patents. We may analyze patents or patent applications of our competitors that we believe are relevant to our activities and consider that we are free to operate in relation to our product candidates, but our competitors may achieve issued claims, including in patents we consider to be unrelated, that block our efforts or potentially result in our product candidates or our activities infringing those issued claims. The possibility also exists that others will develop products that have the same effect as our products on an independent basis that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property rights or will design around the claims of patents that we have had issued that cover our products.\nPast or future patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. In March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, the United States moved from a \"first to invent\" to a \"first-to-file\" patent system. Under a \"first-to-file\" system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to a patent on the invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The America Invents Act includes a number of other significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and establish a new post-grant review system. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO continues to promulgate new regulations and procedures in connection with the America Invents Act and many of the substantive changes to patent law, including the \"first-to-file\" provisions, only became effective in March 2013. In addition, the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and the applicability of the act and new regulations on the specific patents discussed in this filing have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. However, the America Invents Act and its\nimplementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make or use compounds or cells that are similar to the biological compositions of our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022\nthe active biological ingredients in our current product candidates will eventually become commercially available in biosimilar drug products and no patent protection may be available with regard to formulation or method of use;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors, as the case may be, may fail to meet our obligations to the U.S. government regarding any in-licensed patents and patent applications funded by U.S. government grants, leading to the loss of patent rights;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors, as the case may be, might not have been the first to file patent applications for certain inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nit is possible that there are prior public disclosures that could invalidate our or our licensors\u2019 patents, as the case may be, or parts of our or their patents;\n\u2022\nit is possible that others may circumvent our owned or in-licensed patents;\n\u2022\nit is possible that there are unpublished applications or patent applications maintained in secrecy that may later issue with claims covering our products or technology similar to ours;\n\u2022\nthe laws of foreign countries may not protect our or our licensors\u2019, as the case may be, proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States;\n\u2022\nthe claims of our owned or in-licensed issued patents or patent applications, if and when issued, may not cover our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour owned or in-licensed issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages, may be narrowed in scope, or be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties;\n\u2022\nthe inventors of our owned or in-licensed patents or patent applications may become involved with competitors, develop products or processes that design around our patents or become hostile to us or the patents or patent applications on which they are named as inventors;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our owned or in-licensed patents or patent applications omit individual(s) that should be listed as inventor(s) or include individual(s) that should not be listed as inventor(s), which may cause these patents or patents issuing from these patent applications to be held invalid or unenforceable;\n\u2022\nwe have engaged in scientific collaborations in the past and will continue to do so in the future and our collaborators may develop adjacent or competing products that are outside the scope of our patents;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies for which we can obtain patent protection;\n\u2022\nit is possible that product candidates or diagnostic tests we develop may be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights; or\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, we rely heavily upon know-how and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third-parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. For example, significant elements of our research and development approaches, including aspects of sample preparations, methods of manufacturing, cell culturing conditions and computational-biological algorithms, including RECON\u2019s algorithms, and related processes and software, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how that are not publicly disclosed.\nIt is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties, except in certain specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual and that are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working\nhours on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information are our exclusive property. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations and our advice for best practices in protecting our trade secrets.\nIn addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information through other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures. These measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor and any recourse we might take against this type of misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent us from receiving legal recourse. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any of that information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.\nIn addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. If we choose to go to court to stop a third party from using any of our trade secrets, we may incur substantial costs. Even if we are successful, these types of lawsuits may consume our time and other resources. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. As a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our product discovery and development efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, derivation, inter partes review, post grant review, and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our product candidates and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications that are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of drugs, products or their methods of use or manufacture. Thus, because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our fields, there may be a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our product candidates, technologies or methods.\nIf a third party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims that, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product candidate or technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party\u2019s rights, and, if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages plus the patent owner\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees;\n\u2022\na court prohibiting us from developing, manufacturing, marketing or selling our product candidates, or from using our proprietary technologies, unless the third party licenses its product rights to us, which it is not required to do;\n\u2022\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees and other amounts and/or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we redesign our product candidates or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. Generally, conducting clinical trials and other development activities in the United States is not considered an act of infringement. If and when any of our neoantigen-targeting therapy product candidates is approved by the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, a third party who believes that our technology infringes its patent may then be able to seek to enforce its patent by filing a patent\ninfringement lawsuit against us. We are aware of U.S. Patent No. 10,055,540 entitled \"Neoantigen Identification, Manufacture, and Use.\" If a claim is subsequently asserted that any of our neoantigen-targeting therapy product candidates or RECON infringes this patent, we believe that we have reasonable defenses, such as noninfringement or invalidity. There can be no assurance that these defenses will succeed. We also have patent rights in this technology space. Further, while we do not believe that any claims of other outstanding patents that could otherwise materially adversely affect commercialization of our neoantigen therapies product candidates, if approved, are valid and enforceable, we may be incorrect in this belief or we may not be able to prove that position in a litigation. In this regard, patents issued in the United States by law enjoy a presumption of validity that can be rebutted only with evidence that is \"clear and convincing,\" a heightened standard of proof.\nThere may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents.\nIf any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of our product candidates, constructs or molecules used in or formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of those patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize our product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents or until those patents were to expire or are finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy or patient selection methods, the holders of that patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the product candidate unless we obtained a license or until the applicable patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. In either case, a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, particularly if the applicable patent is owned or controlled by one of our primary competitors. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our ability to commercialize our product candidates may be impaired or delayed, which could significantly harm our business. Even if we obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nParties making claims against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee time and resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any license of this nature would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates and we may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize our product candidates, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products. Our products utilize open source software that contain modules licensed for use from third-party authors under open source licenses. In particular, some of the software that powers RECON may be provided under license arrangements that allow use of the software for research or other non-commercial purposes. As a result, in the future, as we seek to use RECON in connection with commercially available products, we may be required to license that software under different license terms, which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to license software components on terms that permit its use for commercial purposes, we may be required to replace those software components, which could result in delays, additional cost and/ or additional regulatory approvals.\nUse and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the software code. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time, and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us. Although we monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that those licenses could be\nconstrued in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In that case we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we there are no currently pending misappropriation or improper disclosure claims and although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third parties. We may then have to pursue litigation to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any claims of this nature, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against these types of claims, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and, if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, that perception could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. This type of litigation or proceeding could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct this type of litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of this type of litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to product components and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nPresently, we have intellectual property rights through licenses from third parties to develop certain of our product candidates and we have filed and may continue to file additional patent applications of our own in the future that may be directed to some or all of these or other product candidates. Because our programs may involve additional product candidates that may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights.\nOur product candidates may also require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others. We may develop products containing our compounds and pre-existing pharmaceutical compounds. We may be required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to provide a companion diagnostic test or tests with our product candidates, which test or tests may be covered by intellectual property rights held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary or important to our business operations. In addition, we may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all, which would harm our business. Were that to happen, we may need to cease use of the compositions or methods covered by those third-party intellectual property rights and seek to develop alternative approaches that do not infringe on those intellectual property rights, which may entail additional costs and development delays, even if we were able to develop such alternatives, which may not be feasible. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, which means that our competitors may also receive access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology.\nAdditionally, we sometimes collaborate with academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. In certain cases, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of whether we hold that type of option, we may be unable to negotiate a license from the institution within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to others, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property or to maintain our existing intellectual property rights, we may have to abandon development of a program our business financial condition, prospects and results of operations could suffer.\nThe licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area and companies, that may be more established or have greater resources than we do may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates. More established\ncompanies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete these types of negotiations and ultimately acquire the rights to the intellectual property surrounding the additional product candidates that we may seek to develop or market.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one or more of our patents is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Defense of these types of claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business.\nWe may choose to challenge the patentability of claims in a third party\u2019s U.S. patent by requesting that the USPTO review the patent claims in an ex-parte re-examination, inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings. These proceedings are expensive and may consume our time or other resources. We may choose to challenge a third party\u2019s patent in patent opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, or EPO, or another foreign patent office. The costs of these opposition proceedings could be substantial, and may consume our time or other resources. If we fail to obtain a favorable result at the USPTO, EPO or other patent office then we may be exposed to litigation by a third party alleging that the patent may be infringed by our product candidates or proprietary technologies.\nIn addition, because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, patent applications are typically not published in the United States until 18 months after their respective filing dates. Further, publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries. Consequently, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our owned and in-licensed issued patents or our pending applications, or that we or, if applicable, a licensor were the first to invent the technology. It is possible that our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our products or technology similar to ours and that those patent applications may have priority over our owned and in-licensed patent applications or patents, which could require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to those owned by or in-licensed to us, we or, in the case of in-licensed technology, the licensor may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. If we or one of our licensors is a party to an interference proceeding involving a U.S. patent application on inventions owned by or in-licensed to us, we may incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s time and expend other resources, even if we are successful.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome in an interference proceeding could result in a loss of our current patent rights and could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Litigation or interference proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, that perception could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies also require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent application process and following the issuance of a patent. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nNoncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. Were a noncompliance event to occur, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIssued patents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court, the USPTO or in foreign jurisdictions.\nIf we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate, as applicable, is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. These types of mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). These types of proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents such that they no longer cover our product candidates. The outcome for any particular patent following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, or if we are otherwise unable to adequately protect our rights, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. A loss of patent protection for our product candidates could have a material adverse impact on our ability to commercialize or license our technology and product candidates and, as a result, on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. In 2018, one of our in-licensed European patents related to our NEO-PV-01 and NEO-PTC-01 product candidates was involved in a European opposition proceeding at the EPO involving several opponents. Following an oral hearing, the EPO decided to revoke this in-licensed patent, which is one asset within our broader intellectual property portfolio that relates to our personal neoantigen product candidates. We and our licensors filed an appeal of this decision and, over what we believe will be a multi-year period while the appeal is pending at the EPO, the claims in the originally granted patent remain effective and enforceable. If we are unsuccessful in this appeal, we will be unable to assert this patent against our competitors marketing products in relevant European countries that would have been deemed to be infringing.\nLikewise, our in-licensed patents directed to our proprietary technologies and our product candidates are expected to expire in 2031, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions. Our earliest in-licensed patents may expire before, or soon after, our first product achieves marketing approval in the United States or foreign jurisdictions. Upon the expiration of our current patents, we may lose the right to exclude others from practicing these inventions. The expiration of these patents could also have a similar material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. We own or in-license pending patent applications directed to proprietary technologies or our product candidates that, if issued as patents, are expected to expire from 2031 through 2038, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions. However, we cannot be assured that the USPTO or relevant foreign patent offices will grant any of these patent applications.\nChanges in patent law in the United States and in non-U.S. jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the case, Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules are not patentable. While we do not believe that any of our owned or in-licensed patents will be found invalid based on this decision, we cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the USPTO may impact the value of our patents. Any similar any adverse changes in the patent laws of other jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nWe have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nWe have limited intellectual property rights outside the United States. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products against third parties in violation of our proprietary rights generally. The initiation of proceedings by third parties to challenge the scope or validity of our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents and we may be unable to protect our rights to our products and technology.\nIf we or our licensors choose to go to court to stop a third party from using the inventions claimed in our owned or in-licensed patents, that third party may ask the court to rule that our patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These types of lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we or our licensors, as the case may be, were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that our patents are not valid and that we or our licensors, as the case may be, do not have the right to stop others from using the inventions in question.\nThere is also the risk that, even if the validity of our patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the third party on the ground that the third party\u2019s activities do not infringe our owned or in-licensed patents. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently changed some legal principles that affect patent applications, granted patents and assessment of the eligibility or validity of these patents. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised eligibility and validity standards. Some of our owned or in-licensed patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in proceedings before the USPTO or during litigation under the revised criteria, which could also make it more difficult to obtain patents.\nWe or our licensors, as the case may be, may not be able to detect infringement against our owned or in-licensed patents, which may be especially difficult for manufacturing processes or formulation patents. Even if we or our licensors detect infringement by a third party of our owned or in-licensed patents, we or our licensors, as the case may be, may choose not to pursue litigation against or settlement with the third party. If we, or our licensors later sue such third party for patent infringement, the third party may have certain legal defenses available to it that otherwise would not be available but for the delay between when the infringement was first detected and when the suit was brought. These legal defenses may make it impossible for us or our licensors to enforce our owned or in-licensed patents, as the case may be, against that third party.\nIf another party questions the patentability of any of our claims in our owned or in-licensed U.S. patents, the third party can request that the USPTO review the patent claims such as in an inter partes review, ex parte re-examination or post-grant review proceedings. These proceedings are expensive and may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent. In addition to potential USPTO review proceedings, we are currently, and may in the future become, party, to patent opposition proceedings at the EPO or similar proceedings in other foreign patent offices where either our owned or in-licensed foreign patents are challenged. In 2018, one of our in-licensed European patents related to our NEO-PV-01 and NEO-PTC-01 product candidates was involved in a European opposition proceeding at the EPO involving several opponents. Following an oral hearing, the EPO decided to revoke this in-licensed patent, which is one asset within our broader intellectual property portfolio that relates to the\nour personal neoantigen product candidates. We and our licensors filed an appeal of this decision and, over what we believe will be multi-year period while an appeal is pending at the EPO, the claims in the originally granted patent remain effective and enforceable. If we are unsuccessful in this appeal, we will be unable to assert this patent against our competitors marketing products in relevant European countries that would have been deemed to be infringing.\nIn the future, we may be involved in similar proceedings challenging the patent rights of others, and the outcome of that type of proceeding is highly uncertain. An adverse determination in any proceeding of that nature could reduce the scope of or invalidate our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. The costs of these opposition or similar proceedings could be substantial and may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent. An unfavorable result at the USPTO, EPO or other patent office may result in the loss of our right to exclude others from practicing one or more of our inventions in the relevant country or jurisdiction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting our product candidates might expire before or shortly after we or our partners commercialize those candidates. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension and data exclusivity for any product candidates we may develop, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidates we may develop, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Action of 1984 Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent per product may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. However, even if we were to seek a patent term extension, it may not be granted because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, the failure to apply within applicable deadlines, the failure to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or the failure otherwise to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded under an extension request could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or if the term of any requested extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe will rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines or comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize any potential product candidates.\nWe presently and, in the future, will depend upon third parties, including independent investigators, to conduct our clinical trials under agreements with universities, medical institutions, CROs, strategic partners and others. As a result, we have to negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs and trial sites, which may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs.\nWe presently do, and in the future will continue to, rely heavily on third parties over the course of our clinical trials, and, as a result, will have limited control over the clinical investigators and limited visibility into their day-to-day activities, including with respect to their compliance with the approved clinical protocol. Nevertheless, our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities and we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards. We and these third parties are required to comply with GCP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to suspend or terminate these trials or perform additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials\nbefore approving our marketing applications. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the applicable GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with biologic products produced under cGMP requirements and may require a large number of patients.\nOur failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these applicable regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nThe third parties who presently or may in the future conduct our clinical trials will not be our employees and, except for remedies that may be available to us under our agreements with those third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing nonclinical and clinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other product development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner or at all. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs or others terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or other third parties or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO begins work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to manufacture our clinical product supplies, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce and process our product candidates, if approved.\nWe do not currently own any facility that may be used as our clinical-scale manufacturing and processing facility and expect to rely on outside vendors to manufacture supplies and process our product candidates. We have not yet caused any product candidates to be manufactured or processed on a commercial scale and may not be able to do so for any of our product candidates. We will make changes as we work to optimize the manufacturing process. For example, we may switch or be required to switch from non-cGMP materials to commercial grade materials in order to get regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot be sure that even minor changes in the process will result in therapies that are safe and effective and approved for commercial sale.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies following inspections that will be conducted after we submit an application to the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies. We do not directly control the manufacturing process of, and will be completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with regulatory requirements, known as cGMP requirements, for the manufacture of our product candidates. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. For instance, for NEO-PTC-01, our outside vendors will harvest T cells from a patient and then prime, activate and expand those T cells ex vivo to create a T cell therapy for that patient that will ultimately be infused back into the patient\u2019s body. As a result of these complexities, the cost to manufacture our product candidates is generally higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds and the manufacturing process is less reliable and is more difficult to reproduce. In addition, we have no direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it finds deficiencies with or withdraws any approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nOur existing and future collaborations will be important to our business. If we are unable to enter into or maintain any of these collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have limited capabilities for product development and do not yet have any capability for sales, marketing or distribution. Accordingly, we have entered into collaborations with other companies to provide us with important technologies for our programs\nand technology and we expect to receive additional technologies under these and other collaborations in the future. Our existing therapeutic collaborations and any future collaborations we may enter into may pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs or license arrangements based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding or external factors, such as a strategic transaction that may divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products and product candidates if the collaborators believe that the competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022\nproduct candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the development, manufacture, distribution or marketing of a product candidate or product;\n\u2022\ncollaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our product or products;\n\u2022\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or terminations of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in a manner that may invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022\nif a collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate we licensed to it; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated by the collaborator, and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nIf our collaborations do not result in the successful discovery, development and commercialization of products or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any anticipated future benefits under the collaboration, our development of our technology and product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop product candidates and our technology. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this filing also apply to the activities of our therapeutic collaborators.\nAdditionally, if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators as the way we are perceived in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected.\nFor some of our programs, we may in the future determine to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development and potential commercialization of product candidates. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborations. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay one or more of our other development programs, delay a product candidate\u2019s potential commercialization, reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need\nto obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations or do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates, bring them to market and generate revenue from sales of drugs or continue to develop our technology and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on single-source suppliers for some of the components and materials used in and the processes required to develop our product candidates.\nWe currently depend on single-source suppliers for some of the components and materials used in and processes required to develop our product candidates. We cannot ensure that these suppliers or service providers will remain in business, have sufficient capacity or supply to meet our needs or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that is not interested in continuing to work with us. Our use of single-source suppliers of raw materials, components, key processes and finished goods exposes us to several risks, including disruptions in supply, price increases or late deliveries. For example, we obtain our vaccine adjuvant, poly-ICLC, which is administered simultaneously with NEO-PV-01, from a single-source supplier. Additionally, we rely on a single-source supplier to manufacture our peptides and a single source for the manufacture of our T cell product candidate NEO-PTC-01. There are, in general, relatively few alternative sources of supply for substitute components. Our current vendors may be unable or unwilling to meet our future demands for our clinical trials or commercial sale. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these components, materials and processes could take a substantial amount of time and it may be difficult to establish replacement suppliers who meet regulatory requirements. Any disruption in supply from any single-source supplier or service provider could lead to supply delays or interruptions, which would damage our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nIf we were to have to switch to a replacement supplier, the manufacture and delivery of our product candidates or components of our product candidates could be interrupted for an extended period, which could adversely affect our business. We may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for the adjuvants, peptides or any of the components or processes used in our product candidates, if required. If we are able to find a replacement supplier, the replacement supplier would need to be qualified, which might require additional regulatory authority approval, which could result in further delay. For example, the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority could require additional supplemental data and clinical trial data if we rely upon a new supplier for the adjuvants and peptides used in our product candidates. While we seek to maintain adequate inventory of the single source components and materials used in our products, any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices, or at all, in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders.\nIn addition, as part of the FDA\u2019s or other regulatory authority's approval of our product candidates, we will also require FDA or other regulatory authority approval of the individual components of our process, which include the manufacturing processes and facilities of our single-source suppliers. Our current single-source suppliers have not undergone this process, nor have they had any components included in any product approved by the FDA.\nOur reliance on these suppliers, service providers and manufacturers subjects us to a number of risks that could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ndelays to the development timelines for our product candidates;\n\u2022\ninterruption of supply resulting from modifications to or discontinuation of a supplier\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\ndelays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues or a supplier\u2019s variation in a component;\n\u2022\na lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components with our suppliers;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or to obtain adequate supply on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost associated with locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our components in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nproduction delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications;\n\u2022\ndelay in delivery due to our suppliers prioritizing other customer orders over ours;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation caused by defective components produced by our suppliers;\n\u2022\nincreased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement based upon defects in components produced by our suppliers; and\n\u2022\nfluctuation in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers.\nIf any of these risks materialize, our costs could significantly increase and our ability to meet demand for our products could be impacted.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe do not know whether there will be an active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock or what the market price of our common stock will be and, as a result, it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock.\nWe became a public company in June 2018 and accordingly there is only a limited history of there being a public market for shares of our common stock. An active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained and, as a result, you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in shares of our common stock is not active. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares of common stock as consideration.\nThe price of our stock may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. In addition to the factors discussed in this \"Risk Factors\" section, these factors may include:\n\u2022\nthe commencement, enrollment or results of our ongoing clinical trials or any future clinical trials we may conduct or changes in the development status of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nany delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority\u2019s review of our regulatory filings, including without limitation the FDA\u2019s issuance of a \"refusal to file\" letter, a clinical hold or a request for additional information;\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u2022\nadverse developments concerning our manufacturers;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nour inability to establish collaborations if and when needed;\n\u2022\nour failure to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nserious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products or services offered by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022\nthe size and growth of our initial cancer target markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully treat additional types of cancers or cancers at different stages;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nour cash position;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or neoantigen-targeted therapies in particular, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nadoption of new accounting standards;\n\u2022\nineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including intellectual property or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nFor instance, in January 2020, we announced entry into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of our company by BioNTech, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2020. As a result of this announcement, the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers and directors and Third Rock Ventures III, L.P., a venture capital fund affiliated with certain of our directors, beneficially held, as of December 31, 2019, in the aggregate, approximately 39% of our outstanding voting stock. Therefore, these stockholders and other principal stockholders will have the ability to influence us through their ownership positions. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction.\nThis may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, which was enacted in April 2012. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the year in which we complete our IPO, which occurred in June 2018, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which requires the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates to exceed $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, changes in rules of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\nor their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are considered a \"smaller reporting company\" under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. We are therefore entitled to rely on certain reduced disclosure requirements, such as an exemption from providing selected financial data and executive compensation information. These exemptions and reduced disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company also mean our auditors are not required to review our internal control over financial reporting and may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our common stock prices may be more volatile. We will remain a smaller reporting company until our public float exceeds $250 million or our annual revenues exceed $100 million with a public float greater than $700 million.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company\" or a \"smaller reporting company\" under applicable SEC regulations, we incur and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which will require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, in July 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as \"say on pay\" and proxy access. Recent legislation permits emerging growth companies to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years from the pricing of their initial public offerings. We intend to take advantage of this new legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned. If that were to happen, we would incur additional and unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nWe expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our pre-initial public offering stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the lapsing of any applicable legal restrictions on resale, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nShares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates may be subject to certain limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. In addition, shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our existing equity compensation plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules, any lock-up agreements and Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2018 Stock Option and Incentive Plan automatically increases on each January 1 by 4% of the outstanding number of\nshares of our common stock on the immediately preceding December 31 or such lesser number of shares as determined by our compensation committee. Unless our compensation committee elects not to increase the number of shares available for future grant each year, our stockholders may experience additional dilution.\nCertain of our stockholders are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nOn July 1, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-232487) with the SEC, which was declared effective on July 8, 2019, or the Shelf Registration Statement, in relation to the registration of common stock, preferred stock, warrants and/or units of any combination thereof for the purposes of selling, from time to time, our common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more offerings. We also simultaneously entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or the Sales Agent, to provide for the offering, issuance and sale of up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million of our common stock from time to time in \"at-the-market\" offerings under the Shelf Registration Statement and subject to the limitations thereof. As of December 31, 2019, we have sold $0.4 million of our common stock in \"at the market offerings\" under the Shelf Registration Statement, prior to applicable commissions under the Sales Agreement. We pay to the Sales Agent cash commissions of 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds of sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement. Sales of common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities by us under the Shelf Registration Statement may represent a significant percentage of our common stock currently outstanding. If we sell, or the market perceives that we intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock under the Shelf Registration Statement or otherwise, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and may not use them effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion in the application of our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether these proceeds are being used appropriately. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. Our management might not apply our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in ways that ultimately increase the value of your investment. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business. Pending their use, we may invest our cash in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders. If we do not invest our cash in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. From time to time, we may enter into license or collaboration agreements with other companies that include development funding and significant upfront and milestone payments and/or royalties, which may become an important source of our revenue. Accordingly, our revenue may depend on development funding and the achievement of development and clinical milestones under any potential future license and collaboration agreements and sales of our products, if approved. These upfront and milestone payments may vary significantly from period to period and any variance could cause a significant fluctuation in our operating results from one period to the next.\nIn addition, we measure compensation cost for stock-based awards made to employees at the grant date of the award, based on the fair value of the award as determined by our board of directors, and recognize the cost as an expense over the employee\u2019s requisite service period. As the variables that we use as a basis for valuing these awards change over time, our underlying stock price and stock price volatility, the magnitude of the expense that we must recognize may vary significantly.\nFurther, our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research and development activities relating to our current and any future product candidates, which will change from time to time;\n\u2022\nour ability to enroll patients in clinical trials and the timing of enrollment;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing our current and any future product candidates, which may vary depending on FDA or other regulatory authority guidelines and requirements, the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers;\n\u2022\nexpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe timing and outcomes of clinical studies for our product candidates or the timing and outcomes of clinical trials for competing product candidates;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing and potential future products that compete with our product candidates and changes in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners;\n\u2022\nany delays in regulatory review or approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our product candidates, if approved, which may fluctuate significantly and be difficult to predict;\n\u2022\nthe risk/benefit profile, cost and reimbursement policies with respect to our products candidates, if approved, and existing and potential future products that compete with our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, within and outside of the United States, either independently or working with third parties;\n\u2022\nour ability to adequately support our future growth;\n\u2022\npotential unforeseen business disruptions that increase our costs or expenses;\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and\n\u2022\nthe changing and volatile global economic environment.\nThe cumulative effect of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. The price of our common stock could decline even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue and/or earnings guidance we may provide.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our organizational documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control, which could limit the market price of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions include:\n\u2022\na board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent, which requires that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders may only be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or by a majority of the total number of authorized directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\na requirement that no member of our board of directors may be removed from office by our stockholders except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by law, upon the approval of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of all outstanding shares of our voting stock then entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u2022\na requirement of approval of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend any bylaws by stockholder action or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock on terms determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval, which preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors and could also delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing or cause us to take other corporate actions\nyou desire. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate specific courts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us\nPursuant to our amended and restated bylaws, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for state law claims for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a claim of or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (3) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or Delaware Forum Provision. The Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts is the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or the Federal Forum Provision. We have chosen the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts as the exclusive forum for such Securities Act causes of action because our principal executive offices are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing Delaware Forum Provision and Federal Forum Provision.\nIn Sciabacucchi v. Salzberg, C.A. No. 2017-0931-JTL (Del. Ch.), the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware issued a decision declaring that federal forum selection provisions that purport to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are ineffective and invalid under Delaware law. On August 5, 2019, the decision was appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court and the appeal is pending. Unless and until the Court of Chancery\u2019s decision in Sciabacucchi is reversed by the Delaware Supreme Court or otherwise abrogated, we do not intend to enforce its Federal Forum Provision designating the District of Massachusetts as the exclusive forum for Securities Act claims. In the event that the Delaware Supreme Court affirms the Court of Chancery\u2019s Sciabacucchi decision or otherwise makes a determination that provisions such as the Federal Forum Provision are invalid, our board of directors intends to promptly amend our bylaws to remove the Federal Forum Provision. Such amendment could cause us to incur additional costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe recognize that the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision in our amended and restated bylaws may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing any such claims, particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the State of Delaware or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as applicable. Additionally, the forum selection clauses in our amended and restated bylaws may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. The Federal Forum Provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert the provision is not enforceable. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, as applicable, may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 17894, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "NTGN"}
