Set forth below are the most important risks we face. In evaluating our business and your investment in the Company, you should also consider the other information presented in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. We may be unable to develop, implement, and maintain appropriate controls in future periods which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). In Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\u201d of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on February 2, 2017, management reported the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses resulted in errors in our previously filed annual audited and interim unaudited consolidated financial statements.\nA \"material weakness\" is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of January 31, 2016 and remains ineffective as of the date of this filing. The assessment was based on criteria described by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Also as a result of the material weaknesses, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of January 31, 2016 and remain ineffective as of the date of this filing. We are actively engaged in remediation activities designed to address the material weaknesses, but our remediation efforts are not complete and are ongoing. The progress made in remediating these material weaknesses is further described in Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If our remediation measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements could occur which could result in a further restatement of our consolidated financial statements and may materially adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner. Although we continually review and evaluate our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The next time we evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, if we identify one or more new material weaknesses or are unable to timely remediate our existing material weaknesses, we may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe could also become subject to private litigation or investigations, or one or more government enforcement actions, arising out of the errors in our previously issued financial statements. Our management may be required to devote significant time and attention to these matters, and these and any additional matters that arise could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe remediation measures in progress to address the material weaknesses have been time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to additional risks that could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe have incurred expenses, including audit, legal, consulting, and other professional fees in connection with the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have taken a number of steps, including adding significant internal resources and have implemented a number of additional procedures in order to strengthen our internal control and risk assessment functions. To the extent these steps are not successful, we could be forced to incur additional time and expense. Our management\u2019s attention has also been diverted from the operation of our business in connection with the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nWeather conditions or natural disasters could affect certain of the Company's markets, such as agriculture and construction, or the Company's primary manufacturing facilities.\nThe Company's Applied Technology Division is largely dependent on the ability of farmers, agricultural service providers, and custom operators to purchase agricultural equipment, including its products. If such farmers experience weather conditions resulting in unfavorable crop prices or farm incomes, sales in the Applied Technology Division may be adversely affected.\nWeather conditions can also adversely affect sales in the Company's Engineered Films Division. To the extent weather conditions curtail construction or agricultural activity, such as a late spring or drought, sales of the segment's plastic sheeting would likely decrease.\nSeasonal, weather-related and market demand variation could also affect quarterly results. If expected sales are deferred in a fiscal quarter while inventory has been built and operating expenses incurred, financial results could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s primary manufacturing facilities for each of its operating divisions are located on contiguous properties in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. If weather-related natural disasters such as tornadoes or flooding were to occur in the area, such conditions could impede the manufacturing and shipping of products and potentially adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales, transactions processing, and financial reporting. The Company has disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Company\u2019s risks to these vulnerabilities but these measures may not be adequate, implemented properly, or executed timely to ensure that the Company\u2019s operations are not disrupted. Such consequences could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nPrice fluctuations in and shortages of raw materials could have a significant impact on the Company's ability to sustain and grow earnings.\nThe Company's Engineered Films Division utilizes significant amounts of polymeric resin, the cost of which depends upon market prices for natural gas and oil and other market forces. These prices are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond the control of the Company. Although the Engineered Films Division is sometimes able to pass on such price increases to its customers, significant variations in the cost of polymeric resins can affect the Company's operating results from period to period. Unusual supply disruptions, such as one caused by a natural disaster, could cause suppliers to invoke \"force majeure\" clauses in their supply agreements, causing shortages of material. Success in offsetting higher raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. If the Company is not able to fully offset the effects of adverse materials availability and correspondingly higher costs, financial results could be adversely affected which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nElectronic components used by both the Applied Technology Division and Aerostar Division, are sometimes in short supply, and may impact our ability to meet customer demand.\nIf a supplier of raw materials or electronic components were unable to deliver due to shortage or financial difficulty, any of the Company's segments could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in commodity prices can increase our costs and decrease our sales.\nAgricultural income levels are affected by agricultural commodity prices and input costs. As a result, changes in commodity prices that reduce agricultural income levels could have a negative effect on the ability of growers and their service providers to purchase the Company's precision agriculture products manufactured by its Applied Technology Division.\nExploration for oil and natural gas fluctuates with their price and energy market conditions are subject to volatility. Certain plastic sheeting manufactured and sold by our Engineered Films Division is sold as pit and pond liners to contain water used in the drilling processes for these energy commodities. Lower prices for oil and natural gas could reduce exploration activities and demand for our products.\nFilm manufacturing uses polymeric resins, which can be subject to changes in price as the cost of oil or natural gas changes. Accordingly, volatility in oil and natural gas prices may negatively affect our raw material costs and cost of goods sold and potentially cause us to increase prices, which could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability.\nFailure to develop and market new technologies and products could impact the Company's competitive position and have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company's operating results in Applied Technology, Engineered Films, and Aerostar depend upon the ability to renew the pipeline of new products and services and to bring these to market. This ability could be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products, successfully complete research and development projects, obtain relevant regulatory approvals, obtain intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products and services. Because of the lengthy development process, technological challenges, and competition, there can be no assurance that any of the products the Company is currently developing, or could begin to develop in the future, will achieve commercial success. Technical advancements in products may also increase the risk of product failure, increasing product returns or warranty claims and settlements. In addition, sales of the Company's new products could replace sales of some of its current products, offsetting the benefit of even a successful new product introduction.\nThe Company's sales of products which are specialized and highly technical in nature are subject to uncertainties, start-up costs and inefficiencies, as well as market, competitive, and compliance risks.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy relies on the design and manufacture of proprietary products. Highly technical, specialized product inventories may be more susceptible to fluctuations in market demand. If demand is unexpectedly low, write-downs or impairments of such inventory may become necessary. Either of these outcomes could adversely affect our results of operations. Start-up costs and inefficiencies can adversely affect operating results and such costs may not be recoverable in a proprietary product environment because the Company may not receive reimbursement from its customers for such costs.\nCompetition in agriculture markets could come from our current customers if original equipment manufacturers develop and integrate precision agriculture technology products themselves rather than purchasing from third parties, thereby reducing demand for Applied Technology\u2019s products.\nRegulatory restrictions could be placed on hydraulic fracturing activities because of environmental and health concerns, reducing demand for Engineered Film\u2019s products. For Engineered Films, the development of alternative technologies, such as closed loop drilling processes that reduce the need for pit liners in energy exploration, could also reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nAerostar\u2019s future growth relies on sales of high-altitude balloons as well as advanced radar systems and aerostats to international markets. In limited cases, such sales may be Direct Commercial Sales to foreign governments rather than Foreign Military Sales through the U.S. government. Direct Commercial Sales to foreign governments often involve large contracts subject to frequent delays because of budget uncertainties, regional military conflicts, political instability, and protracted negotiation processes. Such delays could adversely affect our results of operations. The nature of these markets for Aerostar's radar systems and aerostats makes these products particularly susceptible to fluctuations in market demand. Demand fluctuations and the likelihood of delays in sales involving large contracts for such products also increase the risk of these products becoming obsolete, increasing the risk associated with expected sales of such products. The value of radar system and aerostat inventory are each approximately $4 million at January 31, 2017. This valuation is based on an estimate that the market demand for these products will be sufficient in future periods such that these inventories will be sold at a price greater than carrying value. Write-downs or impairment of the value of such products carried in inventory could adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent products become obsolete or anticipated sales are not realized, our expected future cash flows could be adversely impacted. This could lead to an impairment which could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nSales of certain of Aerostar\u2019s products into international markets increase the compliance risk associated with regulations such as The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), as well as others, exposing the Company to fines and its employees to fines, imprisonment, or civil penalties. Potential consequences of a material violation of such regulations include damage to our reputation, litigation, and increased costs.\nThe Company's Aerostar segment depends on the U.S. government for a significant portion of its sales, creating uncertainty in the timing of and funding for projected contracts.\nA significant portion of Aerostar's sales are to the U.S. government or U.S. government agencies as a prime or sub-contractor. Government spending has historically been cyclical. A decrease in U.S. government defense or near-space research spending or changes in spending allocations could result in one or more of the Company's programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. Reductions in the Company's existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could adversely affect its ability to sustain and grow its future sales and earnings. The Company's U.S. government sales are funded by the federal budget, which operates on an October-to-September fiscal year. Changes in congressional schedules, negotiations for program funding levels, reduced program funding due to U.S government debt limitations, automatic budget cuts (\"sequestration\"), or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract. Funds for multi-year contracts can be changed in subsequent years in the appropriations process.\nIn addition, many U.S. government contracts are subject to a competitive bidding and funding process even after the award of the basic contract, adding an additional element of uncertainty to future funding levels. Delays in the funding process or changes in funding are common and can impact the timing of available funds or can lead to changes in program content or termination at the government's convenience. The loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on the Company's future sales and earnings.\nThe Company derives a portion of its revenues from foreign markets, which subjects the Company to business risks, including risk of changes in government policies and laws or worldwide economic conditions.\nThe Company's sales outside the U.S. were $35.5 million in fiscal 2017, representing approximately 13% of consolidated net sales. The Company's financial results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of U.S. and non-U.S. governments, agencies and similar organizations, along with changes in worldwide economic conditions. These conditions include, but are not limited to, changes in a country's or region's economic or political condition; trade regulations affecting production, pricing, and marketing of products; local labor conditions and regulations; reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; restrictions on currency exchange activities; the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability of our products in U.S. dollars in foreign markets where payments are made in the local currency; burdensome taxes and tariffs; and other trade barriers. International risks and uncertainties also include changing social and economic conditions, terrorism, political hostilities and war, difficulty in enforcing agreements or collecting receivables, and increased transportation or other shipping costs. Any of these such risks could lead to reduced sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales.\nAdverse economic conditions in the major industries the Company serves may materially affect segment performance and consolidated results of operations.\nThe Company's results of operations are impacted by the market fundamentals of the primary industries served. Significant declines of economic activity in the agricultural, oil and gas exploration, construction, industrial, aerospace/defense, and other major markets served may adversely affect segment performance and consolidated results of operations.\nThe Company may pursue or complete acquisitions which represent additional risk and could impact future financial results.\nThe Company's business strategy includes pursuing future acquisitions. Acquisitions involve a number of risks including integration of the acquired company with the Company's operations and unanticipated liabilities or contingencies related to the acquired company. Further, business strategies supported by the acquisition may be in perceived, or actual, opposition to strategies of certain of our customers and our business could be materially adversely affected if those relationships are terminated and the expected strategic benefits are delayed or are not achieved. The Company cannot ensure that the expected benefits of any acquisition will be realized. Costs could be incurred on pursuits or proposed acquisitions that have not yet or may not close which could significantly impact the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Additionally, after the acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Other acquisition risks include delays in realizing benefits from the acquired companies or products; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new product or geographic markets we enter; unforeseen adjustments, charges or write-offs; unforeseen losses of customers of, or suppliers to, acquired businesses; difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses; or challenges arising from increased geographic diversity and complexity of our operations and our information technology systems.\nTotal goodwill and intangible assets account for $52.7 million, or approximately 17%, of the Company's total assets as of January 31, 2017. The Company evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or intangible assets. Our expected future cash flows are dependent on several factors including revenue growth in certain of our product lines and an expectation that the pricing in commodities markets will recover in future periods. Our expected future cash flows could be adversely impacted if our anticipated revenue growth is not realized or if pricing in commodities markets does not recover in future periods. Reductions in cash flows could result in an impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets which could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may fail to continue to attract, develop, and retain key management and other key employees, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees, including experienced and skilled technical personnel. The loss of certain members of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, could negatively impact our operating results and ability to execute our business strategy. Our future success will also depend in part upon our ability to attract, train, motivate, and retain qualified personnel.\nThe Company may fail to protect its intellectual property effectively, or may infringe upon the intellectual property of others.\nThe Company has developed significant proprietary technology and other rights that are used in its businesses. The Company relies on trade secret, copyright, trademark, and patent laws and contractual provisions to protect the Company's intellectual property. While the Company takes enforcement of these rights seriously, other companies such as competitors or persons in related markets may attempt to copy or use the Company's intellectual property for their own benefit.\nIn addition, intellectual property of others also has an impact on the Company's ability to offer some of its products and services for specific uses or at competitive prices. Competitors' patents or other intellectual property may limit the Company's ability to offer products and services to its customers. Any infringement or claimed infringement by the Company of the intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect the Company's ability to continue to provide, or could increase the cost of providing, products and services and negatively impact sales and profitability. Any infringement by the Company could also result in judgments against the Company which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nAmong the Company\u2019s legal proceedings is a patent infringement lawsuit filed in federal district court in Kansas by Capstan Ag Systems, Inc. In this lawsuit, Capstan Ag Systems Inc. has made certain infringement claims against the Company and one of its customers, CNH Industrial America LLC, related to the Applied Technology Division\u2019s Hawkeye\u2122 nozzle control system. This litigation is in the early stages and the potential costs and liability of this pending claim, if any, cannot be determined at this time.\nIntellectual property litigation is very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversions of the Company's resources, both of which could adversely affect its businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, there\nmay be no effective legal recourse against infringement of the Company's intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors.\nTechnology failures or cyber-attacks on the Company's systems could disrupt the Company's operations or the functionality of its products and negatively impact the Company's business.\nThe Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. In addition, a significant portion of internal communications, as well as communication with customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Further, the products in our Applied Technology and Aerostar segments depend upon GPS and other systems through which our products interact with government computer systems and other centralized information sources. We are exposed to the risk of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. Cyber incidents may be deliberate attacks for the theft of intellectual property or other sensitive information or may be the result of unintentional events. Like most companies, the Company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company's control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, foreign governments, and other security issues. Further, attacks on centralized information sources could affect the operation of our products or cause them to malfunction. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Company's risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate, or implemented properly, or executed timely to ensure that the Company's operations are not disrupted. Potential consequences of a material cyber incident include damage to our reputation, litigation, and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs. Such consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 62033, "SIC": 3080, "TIC": "RAVN"}
