RISK FACTORS\nOur business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d and the following:\nRisks Related to the Telecommunications Industry\nIntensifying competition in all segments of our business may limit our ability to sustain profitable operations.\nAs new technologies are developed and deployed by competitors in our service area, some of our subscribers may select other providers\u2019 offerings based on price, capabilities and personal preferences. Most of our competitors possess greater resources, have more extensive coverage areas, and offer more services than we do. If significant numbers of our subscribers elect to move to other competing providers, or if market saturation limits the rate of new subscriber additions, we may not be able to sustain profitable operations.\nNationwide, incumbent local exchange carriers have experienced a decrease in access lines due to the effect of wireless and wireline competition. We have experienced comparatively modest reductions in the number of access lines to date, but based on industry experience we anticipate that the long-term trend toward declining telephone subscriber counts will continue. There is a significant risk that this downward trend could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s landline telephone operations in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue from fiber leases may be adversely impacted by price competition for these facilities.\nAlternative technologies, changes in the regulatory environment and current uncertainties in the marketplace may reduce future demand for existing telecommunication services.\nThe telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological change, evolving industry standards, ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter development cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in end-user requirements and preferences. Technological advances, industry changes, changes in the regulatory environment, and the availability of additional spectrum or additional flexibility with respect to the use of currently available spectrum could cause the technology we use to become obsolete. We and our vendors may not be able to respond to such changes and implement new technology on a timely basis, or at an acceptable cost.\nAdverse economic conditions in the United States and in our market area involving significantly reduced consumer spending could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur customers are individual consumers and businesses that provide goods and services to others, and are located in a relatively concentrated geographic area. Any national economic weakness, restricted credit markets, and high unemployment rates could depress consumer spending and harm our operating performance. In addition, any adverse economic conditions that affect our geographic markets in particular could have further negative impacts on our results.\nRegulation by government and taxing agencies may increase our costs of providing service or require changes in services, either of which could impair our financial performance.\nOur operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, the FAA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as by state and local regulatory agencies and franchising authorities. Action by these regulatory bodies could negatively affect our operations and our costs of doing business. For example, changes in tax laws or the interpretation of existing tax laws by state and local authorities could increase income, sales, property or other tax costs.\nOur access revenue may be adversely impacted by legislative or regulatory actions, or technology developments, that decrease access rates or exempt certain traffic from paying for access to our regulated telephone network.\nOn October 27, 2011, the FCC adopted a number of broad changes to the intercarrier compensation rules governing the interstate access rates charged by small-to-mid-sized ILECs such as Shenandoah Telephone. For example, the FCC adopted a national \u201cbill and keep\u201d framework, which may result in substantial reductions in the access charges paid by long distance carriers and other interconnecting carriers, possibly to zero, accompanied by increases to the subscriber line charges paid by business and residential end users. In addition, the FCC has changed some of the rules that determine what compensation carriers, including but not limited to wireless carriers, competitive local exchange carriers, VoIP providers and providers of other Internet-enabled services, should pay (and receive) for their traffic that is interconnected with ILEC networks. These changes, and potential future changes, to such compensation regulations could increase our expenses or reduce our revenues.\nThe VSCC has jurisdiction over local telephone companies\u2019 intrastate access charges, and has indicated in the past that it might open a generic proceeding on the rates charged for intrastate access, although the scope and likelihood of such a proceeding is unclear in light of the FCC\u2019s overhaul of the intercarrier compensation rules, which affect states\u2019 jurisdiction over intrastate access charges. The VSCC issued a Final Order on August 9, 2011 that requires elimination of common carrier line charges in three stages. Pursuant to the order, the Company\u2019s intrastate common line revenue has declined in each of the last three years and was eliminated in mid-2014.\nOur distribution networks may be subject to weather-related events that may damage our networks and adversely impact our ability to deliver promised services or increase costs related to such events.\nOur distribution networks may be subject to weather-related events that could damage our networks and impact service delivery. Some published reports predict that warming global temperatures will increase the frequency and severity of such weather related events. Should such predictions be correct, and should such events impact the Mid-Atlantic region covered by our networks more frequently than in the past, our revenues and expenses could be materially adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to our Overall Business Strategy\nWe may not benefit from our acquisition strategy.\nAs part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance the value of our company by pursuing acquisitions of other businesses, and we intend to evaluate whether to pursue such strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise, though we remain subject to financial and other covenants in our credit agreements that contain restrictions as to the opportunities we may be able to pursue. We cannot provide any assurance, however, with respect to the timing, likelihood, size or financial effect of any potential transaction involving our company, as we may not be successful in identifying and consummating any acquisition or in integrating any newly acquired business into our operations.\nThe evaluation of business acquisition opportunities and the integration of any acquired businesses pose a number of significant risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 acquisitions may place significant strain on our management, financial and other resources by requiring us to expend a substantial amount of time and resources in the pursuit of acquisitions that we may not complete, or to devote significant attention to the various integration efforts of any newly acquired businesses, all of which will require the allocation of limited resources;\n\u00b7 acquisitions may not have a positive impact on our cash flows or financial performance, even if acquired companies eventually contribute to an increase in our cash flows or profitability, because the acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results in the short term as a result of transaction-related expenses we will have to pay or the higher operating and administrative expenses we may incur in the periods immediately following an acquisition as we seek to integrate the acquired business into our operations;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to eliminate as many redundant costs as we anticipate;\n\u00b7 our operating and financial systems and controls and information services may not be compatible with those of the companies we may acquire and may not be adequate to support our integration efforts, and any steps we take to improve these systems and controls may not be sufficient;\n\u00b7 our business plans and projections used to justify the acquisitions and expansion investments are based on assumptions of revenues per subscriber, penetration rates in specific markets where we operate, and expected operating costs. These assumptions may not develop as projected, which may negatively impact our profitability;\n\u00b7 growth through acquisitions will increase our need for qualified personnel, who may not be available to us or, if they were employed by a business we acquire, remain with us after the acquisition; and\n\u00b7 acquired businesses may have unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which could be significant.\nOur ability to comply with the financial covenants in our credit agreement depends primarily on our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow.\nOur ability to comply with the financial covenants under the agreement governing our secured credit facilities will depend primarily on our success in generating sufficient operating cash flow. Under our credit agreement, we are subject to a total leverage ratio covenant, a minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant, and a minimum equity to assets ratio covenant. Industry conditions and financial, business and other factors, including those we identify as risk factors in this and our other reports, will affect our ability to generate the cash flows we need to meet those financial tests and ratios. Our failure to meet the tests or ratios could result in a default and acceleration of repayment of the indebtedness under our credit facilities. If the maturity of our indebtedness were accelerated, we would not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness. In such event, our lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness, which includes substantially our entire assets, to the extent permitted by our credit agreement and applicable law.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and ability to compete.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $224.3 million of total long-term indebtedness, including the current portion of such indebtedness. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it may:\n\u00b7 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a significant portion of our borrowings may continue to be at variable rates of interest;\n\u00b7 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to borrow additional funds to alleviate liquidity constraints, as a result of financial and other restrictive covenants in our credit agreement;\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u00b7 place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have less indebtedness.\nIn addition, our secured credit facilities impose operating and financial restrictions that limit our discretion on some business matters, which could make it more difficult for us to expand, finance our operations and engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. These restrictions limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to:\n\u00b7 incur additional indebtedness and additional liens on our assets;\n\u00b7 engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets;\n\u00b7 pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u00b7 voluntarily prepay other indebtedness;\n\u00b7 enter into transactions with affiliated persons;\n\u00b7 make investments; and\n\u00b7 change the nature of our business.\nIn addition to the term loan secured indebtedness we have incurred, and the $50 million of revolving credit indebtedness we may incur from time to time, we may incur additional indebtedness under our credit facilities. Any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future may subject us to similar or even more restrictive conditions.\nOur ability to refinance our indebtedness in the future, should circumstances require it, will depend on our ability in the future to generate cash flows from operations and to raise additional funds, including through the offering of equity or debt securities. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to raise additional funds in amounts necessary for us to repay our indebtedness when such indebtedness becomes due and to meet our other cash needs.\nOur wireless switch equipment, as well as the primary means of access to and from our customers to other parties\u2019 telecommunications networks, are located in one building.\nOur wireless switch, as well as many of the trunk lines and other circuits that provide access to and from our customers for voice services, and to some extent video services, are all housed in one building. Should that building and its contents be damaged severely, our ability to deliver many of our promised services may be substantially affected for extended periods of time, causing us to lose or refund revenue, lose customers, or incur significant costs to repair damage quickly to minimize the loss of revenues and customers. If proper or adequate insurance coverage is not in place, we may incur substantial costs to replace damaged equipment and other assets.\nDisruptions of our information technology infrastructure could harm our business.\nWe depend on our information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. A disruption of our infrastructure could be caused by a natural disaster, manufacturing failure, telecommunications system failure, or defective or improperly installed new or upgraded business management systems. Portions of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays, or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. In the event of any such disruption, we may be unable to conduct our business in the normal course. Moreover, our business involves the processing, storage and transmission of data, which would also be negatively affected by such an event. A disruption of our infrastructure could cause us to lose customers and revenue, particularly during a period of heavy demand for our services. We also could incur significant expense in repairing system damage and taking other remedial measures.\nWe could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm, and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyber attacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our customers, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \"bugs\" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system.\nThe costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our critical functions. We could lose existing or potential customers for our services in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in the services. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other third parties could expose us, our customers, or other third parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use and security of user data. Our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify customers or employees of a data security breach. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.\nRisks Related to the Wireless Industry\nNew disclosure or usage requirements could adversely affect the results of our wireless operations.\nThe FCC is considering imposing additional consumer protection requirements upon wireless service providers, including billing-related disclosures and usage alerts. Such requirements could increase costs related to or impact the amount of revenue we receive from our wireless services.\nCustomer concerns over radio frequency emissions may discourage use of wireless handsets or expose us to potential litigation.\nIn the past, media reports have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health problems, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Additionally, the FCC has commenced a rulemaking and notice of inquiry that seeks public comment on a variety of issues, including whether revisions to the existing radio frequency standards and testing requirements are warranted. Any decrease in demand for wireless services, increases in the costs of litigation, or damage awards resulting from substantiation of harm from such emissions could impair our ability to sustain profitable operations.\nRegulation by government or potential litigation relating to the use of wireless phones while driving could adversely affect the results of our wireless operations.\nSome studies have indicated that some aspects of using wireless phones while driving may impair drivers' attention in certain circumstances, making accidents more likely. These concerns could lead to litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries, or to new restrictions or regulations on wireless phone use. A number of state and local governments are considering or have enacted legislation that would restrict or prohibit the use of a wireless handset while driving a vehicle or, alternatively, require the use of a hands-free handset. Additionally, certain federal agencies have adopted rules and proposed guidelines for the use of wireless handsets while operating commercial and non-commercial vehicles. These rules, and any legislation that could be enacted, may require wireless service providers to supply to their subscribers hands-free enhanced services, such as voice-activated dialing and hands-free speaker phones and headsets, in order to continue generating revenue from subscribers, who make many of their calls while on the road. If we are unable to provide hands-free services and products to subscribers in a timely and adequate fashion, the volume of wireless phone usage would likely decrease, and the ability of our wireless operations to generate revenues would suffer.\nRisks Related to our Wireless Services\nThe performance of our wireless service provider Shenandoah Personal Communications, LLC, our largest operating subsidiary in terms of revenues and assets, may be adversely affected by any interruption in, or other adverse change to, Sprint\u2019s business.\nWe rely on Sprint\u2019s ongoing operations to continue to offer our wireless subscribers the seamless national services that we currently provide. Any interruption in, or other adverse change to, Sprint\u2019s business could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our business could also be adversely affected if competing national or regional wireless carriers are able to introduce new products and services or otherwise satisfy customers\u2019 service demands more rapidly or more effectively than Sprint.\nOur participation in Sprint\u2019s network modernization plan may affect our operating results, liquidity and financial position.\nSprint is implementing a network modernization plan, known as Network Vision, which incorporates upgrades and improvements to its wireless networks, with the intention of improving voice quality, coverage and data speeds and simultaneously reducing future operating costs. We participated in this plan, and to date, have upgraded the network in our service areas, on time and on budget.\nThe continuing success of the Network Vision plan will depend on the timing, extent and cost of implementation and the performance of third parties. Future activities include incorporating the 2.5 gigahertz spectrum to be acquired from Sprint. Should Sprint\u2019s implementation of the Network Vision plan be delayed, our margins could be adversely affected and such effects could be material. Should Sprint\u2019s future delivery of services expected to be deployed on the upgraded network be delayed, it could potentially result in the loss of customers to our competitors, and adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows from operations.\nOur business may suffer as a result of competitive pressures.\nOur revenue growth is primarily dependent on the growth of the subscriber base and monthly recurring charges to subscribers. In 2014, competitive pressures have moved the focus from unlimited individual plans to family shared data plans. These competitive pressures in the wireless telecommunications market could cause some major carriers to offer plans with increasingly larger bundles of minutes of use and data services at lower prices. Increased price competition will lead to lower monthly recurring charges or a loss of subscribers in the future. Continued competitive pressures in 2015 and beyond could require Sprint to lower its prices, which will limit growth in monthly recurring charges to subscribers.\nWe may not be able to implement our business plan if our operating costs are higher than we anticipate.\nIncreased competition may lead to higher promotional costs to acquire subscribers. If these costs are more than we anticipate, the actual amount of funds available to implement our operating strategy and business plan may fall short of our estimates.\nThe dynamic nature of the wireless market may limit management\u2019s ability to correctly identify causes of volatility in key operating performance measures.\nOur business plan and estimated future operating results are based on estimates of key operating performance measures, including subscriber growth, subscriber turnover (commonly known as churn), average monthly revenue per subscriber, equipment revenue, and subscriber acquisition costs and other operating costs. Recent moves by all carriers to offer installment billing and leasing for handsets will have an effect on revenues, cost of goods sold, and churn. Since these plans are new to the industry, the full impact of these changes cannot be determined at this time. The dynamic nature of the wireless market, economic conditions, increased competition in the wireless telecommunications industry, the entry of new competitors due to recent or future FCC spectrum auctions, new service offerings by Sprint or competitors at lower prices, and other issues facing the wireless telecommunications industry in general have created a level of uncertainty that may adversely affect our ability to predict these key measures of performance.\nWe may experience a high rate of subscriber turnover, which could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nSubscriber loss, or churn, has been relatively stable in recent years. Because of significant competition in the industry, the popularity of prepaid wireless service offerings, changes to Sprint\u2019s competitive position and a new economic downturn, among other factors, this relative stability may not continue and the future rate of subscriber turnover may be higher than in recent periods.\nA high rate of subscriber loss could increase the sales and marketing costs we incur in obtaining new subscribers, especially because, consistent with industry practice, even with the introduction of handset installment billing and leasing, we expect to continue to subsidize a significant portion of the costs related to the purchases of handsets by some subscribers.\nWe may incur significantly higher wireless handset subsidy costs than we anticipate for existing subscribers who upgrade to a new handset.\nAs our subscriber base matures, and technological innovations occur, we anticipate that existing subscribers will continue to upgrade to new wireless handsets. To discourage customer defections to competitors, we offer price plans that subsidize a portion of the price of wireless handsets and in some cases incur sales commissions for handset upgrades. If more subscribers upgrade to new subsidized wireless handsets than we project, or if the cost of such handsets increases or the amount of handset subsidies offered in the competitive marketplace increases more than we project, our results of operations would be adversely affected. If we do not continue to offer the option to subsidize the cost of the handsets for handset upgrades, subscribers could choose to deactivate the service and move to other carriers.\nIf we are unable to secure and retain tower sites, the level of service we provide could be adversely affected.\nMany of our cell sites are co-located on leased tower facilities shared with one or more wireless providers. A large portion of these leased tower sites are owned by a limited number of companies. If economic conditions affect the leasing company, our ability to enter into leases at new locations may be affected, which could leave portions of our service area without service and increase customer turnover.\nMost of the towers that we own are located on leased real property. If such leases were not renewed, we could be forced to relocate our cell site, which would create significant additional expenses, or leave portions of our service area without service, increasing the likelihood of customer turnover.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Sprint\nSprint may make business decisions that are not in our best interests, which may adversely affect our relationships with subscribers in our territory, increase our expenses and decrease our revenues.\nUnder its agreements with us, Sprint has a substantial amount of control over the conduct of our wireless business. Accordingly, Sprint may make decisions that could adversely affect our wireless business, such as the following:\n\u00b7 Sprint could price its national plans based on its own objectives and could set price levels or other terms that may not be economically advantageous for us;\n\u00b7 Sprint could develop products and services that could adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u00b7 if Sprint\u2019s costs to perform certain services exceed the costs they expect, subject to limitations under our agreements, Sprint could seek to increase the amounts charged to us for such services;\n\u00b7 Sprint could make decisions that could adversely affect the Sprint brand names, products or services;\n\u00b7 Sprint could make technology and network decisions that could greatly increase our capital investment requirements and our operating costs to continue offering the seamless national service we provide;\n\u00b7 Sprint could restrict our ability to offer new services needed to remain competitive. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other wireless service providers if they begin offering new services in our market areas, increasing our churn and reducing our revenues and operating income from wireless services.\nOur dependence on Sprint for services may limit our ability to forecast operating results.\nOur dependence on Sprint injects a degree of uncertainty into our business and financial planning. We may, at times, disagree with Sprint concerning the applicability, calculation approach, or accuracy of Sprint-supplied revenue data. It is our practice to reflect the information supplied by Sprint in our financial statements for the applicable periods and to make corrections, if any, no earlier than the period in which Sprint and we agree to the corrections.\nInaccuracies in data provided by Sprint could overstate or understate our expenses or revenues and result in out-of-period adjustments that may adversely affect our financial results.\nBecause Sprint provides billing and collection services for us, Sprint remits a significant portion of our total revenues. We rely on Sprint to provide accurate, timely and sufficient data and information to enable us to properly record revenues, expenses and accounts receivable which underlie a substantial portion of our financial statements and other financial disclosures. We and Sprint could discover errors or inaccuracies, which, while not material to Sprint, could be material to us. If we are required in the future to make adjustments or incur charges as a result of errors or inaccuracies in data provided by Sprint, such adjustments or charges could materially affect our financial results for the period with respect to which the adjustments are made or charges are incurred. Such adjustments or charges could require restatement of our financial statements.\nWe are subject to risks relating to Sprint\u2019s provision of back office services, and changes in products, services, plans and programs.\nAny failure by Sprint to provide high-quality back office services could lead to subscriber dissatisfaction, increased churn or otherwise increased costs. We rely on Sprint\u2019s internal support systems, including customer care, billing and back office support. Our operations could be disrupted if Sprint is unable to provide and expand its internal support systems while maintaining acceptable service levels, or to efficiently outsource those services and systems through third-party vendors.\nThe competitiveness of Sprint\u2019s wireless products and services is a key factor in our ability to attract and retain subscribers. Changes in Sprint\u2019s wireless products and services may reduce subscriber additions, increase subscriber turnover and decrease subscriber credit quality.\nSprint\u2019s roaming arrangements to provide service outside of the Sprint National Network may not be competitive with other wireless service providers, which may restrict our ability to attract and retain subscribers and may increase our costs of doing business.\nWe rely on Sprint\u2019s roaming arrangements with other wireless service providers for coverage in areas where Sprint wireless service is not available. If customers are not able to roam quickly or efficiently onto other wireless networks, we may lose current subscribers and Sprint wireless services may be less attractive to new subscribers.\nThe risks related to our roaming arrangements include the following:\n\u00b7 the quality of the service provided by another provider while roaming may not approximate the quality of the service provided by the Sprint wireless network;\n\u00b7 the price of a roaming call off network may not be competitive with prices of other wireless companies for roaming calls, or may not be \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d (as determined by the FCC);\n\u00b7 customers may not be able to use Sprint\u2019s advanced features, such as voicemail notification, while roaming; and\n\u00b7 Sprint or the carriers providing the service may not be able to provide accurate billing information on a timely basis.\nSome provisions of the Sprint agreements may diminish the value of our common stock and restrict or diminish the value of our business.\nUnder limited circumstances involving non-renewal of our agreement or a breach by us, Sprint may purchase the operating assets of our wireless operations at a discount of 20% in the event of non-renewal, or 28% in the event of a breach. These discounts would be applied to the \u201centire business value\u201d (\u201cEBV\u201d) as that term is defined in our agreement with Sprint. EBV is defined as i) the fair market value of a going concern paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller; ii) valued as if the business will continue to utilize existing brands and operate under existing agreements; and, iii) valued as if we own the spectrum. Determination of EBV is made by an independent appraisal process. In addition, Sprint must approve any assignment of the Sprint agreements by us. Sprint also has a right of first refusal to purchase our wireless operating assets if we decide to sell those assets to a third party. These restrictions and other restrictions contained in the Sprint agreements could adversely affect the value of our common stock, may limit our ability to sell the foregoing assets on advantageous terms, may reduce the value a buyer would be willing to pay, and may reduce the EBV, as described in the Sprint agreements.\nWe may have difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of handsets from Sprint.\nWe depend on our relationship with Sprint to obtain handsets. Sprint orders handsets from various manufacturers. We could have difficulty obtaining specific types of handsets in a timely manner if:\n\u00b7 Sprint does not adequately project the need for handsets, or enter into arrangements for new types of handsets or other customer equipment, for itself, its wireless affiliates and its other third-party distribution channels, particularly in connection with the transition to new technologies;\n\u00b7 Sprint gives preference to other distribution channels;\n\u00b7 we do not adequately project our need for handsets;\n\u00b7 Sprint modifies its handset logistics and delivery plan in a manner that restricts or delays access to handsets; or\n\u00b7 there is an adverse development in the relationship between Sprint and its suppliers or vendors.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could disrupt subscribers\u2019 service or result in a decrease in our subscribers.\nIf Sprint does not continue to enhance its nationwide digital wireless network, we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers.\nOur wireless operations are dependent on Sprint\u2019s national network. Sprint\u2019s digital wireless network may not provide nationwide coverage to the same extent as the networks of its competitors, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain subscribers. Sprint currently covers a significant portion of the population of the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Sprint offers wireless services, either on its own network or through its roaming agreements, in every part of the United States.\nIf Sprint\u2019s wireless licenses are not renewed or are revoked, our wireless business would be harmed.\nNon-renewal or revocation by the FCC of Sprint\u2019s wireless licenses would significantly harm us. Wireless spectrum licenses are subject to renewal and revocation by the FCC. There may be opposition to renewal of Sprint\u2019s wireless licenses upon their expiration, and Sprint\u2019s wireless licenses may not be renewed. The FCC has adopted specific standards to apply to wireless license renewals. Any failure by Sprint to comply with these standards could cause revocation or forfeiture of Sprint\u2019s wireless licenses.\nIf Sprint does not maintain control over its licensed spectrum, our Sprint agreements may be terminated, which would render us unable to continue providing service to our subscribers. Sprint may also need additional spectrum to keep up with customer demands and the availability and cost of this spectrum could have an impact on our wireless business.\nRisks Related to Our Cable Services\nWe face risks from increasing competition for the provision of cable and related video services.\nIncumbent cable companies, which have historically provided video service, face competition from direct broadcast satellite providers, and more recently from large providers of wireline telecommunications services (such as Verizon, Centurylink and AT&T), which have begun to upgrade their networks to provide video services in addition to voice and broadband services. Wireless providers are also entering the market for video services by making such services available on handsets and tablets. In some areas, direct broadcast satellite providers have partnered with large incumbent telecommunications service providers to offer triple-play services. Moreover, consumers are increasingly accessing video content from alternative sources, such as Internet-based \u201cover the top\u201d providers and applications. The influx of competitors in this area, together with the development of new technologies to support them, are resulting in significant changes in the video business models and regulatory provisions that have applied to the provision of video and other services. These developments may lead to a decline in the price and profitability of video and related services.\nOur programming costs are subject to demands for increased payments.\nThe cable television industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming. In addition, as we add programming to our video services for existing customers or distribute existing programming to more customers, we incur increased programming expenses. Broadcasters affiliated with major over-the-air network services have been increasing their demands for cash payments and other concessions for the right to carry local network television signals on our cable systems. If we are unable to raise our customers\u2019 rates or offset such increased programming and retransmission consent costs through the sale of additional services, these increased costs could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Moreover, as our programming contracts and retransmission agreements with programming providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms. The Copyright Office adopted rules in 2014 governing private audits of cable operators\u2019 compulsory copyright payments, and any resulting audits initiated by copyright owners could lead to demands for increased copyright payments.\nChanges to key regulatory requirements can affect our ability to compete.\nAs programming and retransmission consent costs and retail rates increase, Congress and the FCC have expressed concern about the impact on consumers, and they could impose restrictions affecting cable rates and programming packages that could adversely impact our existing business model.\nThe Company operates cable television systems in largely rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland. Virginia has adopted legislation to make it easier for companies to obtain local franchises to provide cable television service. The FCC has adopted new rules which substantially reduce the cost of obtaining a local franchise. These rules may make it easier for the Company to expand its cable television business, but also may result in increased competition for such business.\nMany franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. Franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. In some instances, local franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of our franchise agreements. Additionally, although historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, our franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area.\nPole attachments are wires and cables that are attached to utility poles. Cable system attachments to investor-owned public utility poles historically have been regulated at the federal or state level, generally resulting in reasonable pole attachment rates for attachments used to provide cable service. In contrast, utility poles owned by municipalities or cooperatives are not subject to federal regulation and are generally exempt from state regulation and their attachment rates tend to be higher. In 2011, the FCC amended its pole attachment rules to promote broadband deployment. The order overall strengthens the cable industry's ability to access investor-owned utility poles on reasonable rates, terms and conditions It also allows for new penalties in certain cases involving unauthorized attachments that could result in additional costs for cable operators. The new rules were affirmed in 2013. Future regulatory changes in this area could impact the pole attachment rates we pay utility companies.\nIn December 2014, as part of the STELA Reauthorization Act, Congress repealed a prohibition on cable operators offering set-top boxes with integrated security and navigational features (effective December 4, 2015), but also directed the FCC to establish a working group of \u201ctechnical experts\u201d to identify downloadable security design options to facilitate consumer use of retail navigation devices in lieu of set-top boxes provided by cable operators. Third parties may use this process to advocate for additional regulations, such as requirements for cable operators to support a new interface that can be accessed by retail devices. We cannot predict the nature and pace of these and other developments or the effect they may have on our operations. New regulations could increase our cost for equipment, affect our relationship with our customers, and/or enable third parties to try to offer equipment that accesses disaggregated cable content merged with other services delivered over the Internet to compete with our premium service offerings.\nAny significant impairment of our non-amortizing cable franchise rights would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had non-amortizing cable franchise rights of approximately $64.1 million which constituted approximately 10.3% of total assets at that date. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our cable operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in the carrying value of the Company\u2019s assets and reduction in our net operating performance. We test non-amortizing intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the non-amortizing intangible assets and the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible assets, in the period in which the determination is made. The testing of non-amortizing intangible assets for impairment requires the Company to make significant estimates about the future performance and cash flows of our Cable segment, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future reporting unit operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies. Any changes to key assumptions about our Cable segment\u2019s business and its future prospects, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, or other assumptions, could affect the fair value of our Cable segment non-amortizing intangibles, resulting in an impairment charge.\nRisks Related To Our Broadband Services\nOur broadband services may be adversely impacted by legislative or regulatory changes that affect our ability to develop and offer services or that could expose us to liability from customers or others.\nThe Company provides broadband Internet access services to its cable and telephone customers through cable modems and digital subscriber lines (\u201cDSL\u201d), respectively. The FCC has adopted \u201copen internet\u201d rules, also referred to as \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d that could affect the Company\u2019s provision of broadband services. On January 14, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Verizon v. FCC, struck down major portions of the FCC\u2019s 2010 net neutrality rules governing the operating practices of broadband Internet access providers like us. The FCC originally designed the rules to ensure an \u201copen Internet\u201d and included three key requirements for broadband providers: 1) a prohibition against blocking websites or other online applications; 2) a prohibition against unreasonable discrimination among Internet users or among different websites or other sources of information; and 3) a transparency requirement compelling the disclosure of network management policies. The Court struck down the first two requirements, concluding that they constitute \u201ccommon carrier\u201d restrictions that are not permissible given the FCC\u2019s earlier decision to classify Internet access as an \u201cinformation service,\u201d rather than a \u201ctelecommunications service.\u201d The Court upheld the FCC\u2019s transparency requirement.\nOn May 15, 2014, the FCC initiated a new rulemaking to re-issue network neutrality regulations relying on either Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 or Title II of the Communications Act. More recently, on February 4, 2015, the Chairman of the FCC released a fact sheet describing his proposed new rules. The FCC Chairman proposes to reclassify wireline and wireless broadband services as Title II common carrier services, and asserts legal authority to regulate broadband service offered by ISPs under Title II, Title III, and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act. In an effort to protect consumers and edge providers, the new rules would prohibit ISPs from engaging in blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization, and the existing transparency rules would be enhanced. Reasonable network management activities would remain permitted. For the first time, the FCC would have authority to hear complaints and take enforcement action if it determines that the interconnection of ISPs are not just and reasonable, or if ISPs fail to meet a new general obligation not to harm consumers or edge providers. The Chairman has proposed forbearing from certain Title II regulation, such as rate regulation, tariffs and last-mile unbundling. He does not propose assessment of USF fees on broadband at this time. On February 26, 2015 the FCC adopted the Chairman\u2019s proposal to establish additional rules to reclassify and regulate broadband services. We expect there will be legal challenges filed by several different broadband providers, and possibly others, the success of which depends on numerous factors. There are also legislative proposals in Congress to preempt the Chairman\u2019s proposed \u201cutility-style\u201d regulation, while still addressing many of the underlying concerns. We do not know at the current time if the new regulations proposed by the Chairman will go into effect, nor do we know how they would be administered, but they could limit our ability to efficiently manage our cable systems and respond to operational and competitive challenges. Such rules or statutes could also restrict arrangements between us and Internet content, application, and service providers, including backbone connection arrangements. In addition, if the FCC were to adopt new rules under a Title II framework, the reclassification of broadband services as Title II common carrier services could subject our services to far more extensive and burdensome federal and state regulation.\nOn January 29, 2015, the FCC, in a nation-wide proceeding evaluating whether \u201cadvanced broadband\u201d is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion, increased the minimum connection speeds required to qualify as advanced broadband service to 25 Mbps for downloads and 3 Mbps for uploads. As a result, the FCC concluded that advanced broadband was not being sufficiently deployed and initiated a new inquiry into what steps it might take to encourage broadband deployment. This action may lead the FCC to adopt additional measures affecting our broadband business. At the same time, the FCC has ongoing proceedings to allocate additional spectrum for advanced wireless service, which could provide additional wireless competition to our broadband business.\nRisks Related to Our Voice Services\nOffering voice communications service may subject us to additional regulatory burdens, causing us to incur additional costs.\nWe offer voice communications services over our broadband network and continue to develop and deploy VoIP services. The FCC has ruled that competitive telephone companies that support VoIP services, such as those we offer our customers, are entitled to interconnect with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that our VoIP services can compete in the market. The scope of these interconnection rights are being reviewed in a current FCC proceeding, which may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice services or result in additional costs. The FCC has also declared that certain VoIP services are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation. The full extent of the FCC preemption of state and local regulation of VoIP services is not yet clear. It is not clear how the FCC Chairman\u2019s proposal to reclassify wireline and wireless broadband services as Title II common carrier services, and subject to Section 706, will affect the regulatory status of our VoIP services. Expanding our offering of these services may require us to obtain certain additional authorizations. We may not be able to obtain such authorizations in a timely manner, or conditions could be imposed upon such licenses or authorizations that may not be favorable to us. Telecommunications companies generally are subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to VoIP providers. If additional telecommunications regulations are applied to our VoIP service, it could cause us to incur additional costs.\nThe FCC has already extended certain traditional telecommunications carrier requirements to many VoIP providers such as us, including E911, USF collection, CALEA, privacy of CPNI, number porting, rural call completion, outage reporting, disability access and discontinuance of service requirements. In November 2011, the FCC released an order significantly changing the rules governing intercarrier compensation payments for the origination and termination of telephone traffic between carriers, including VoIP service providers like us. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rules in May, 2014. The new rules will result in a substantial decrease in intercarrier compensation payments over a multi-year period. In addition, the potential transition of Local Number Portability Administrators may impact our ability to manage number porting and related tasks, and/or may result in additional costs arising from the transition to a new administrator.", "PERMNO": 88742, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "SHEN"}
