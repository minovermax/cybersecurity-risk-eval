{"cik": "1014111", "company": "IMATION CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nOur business faces many risks. Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or our other SEC filings, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe must make strategic decisions from time to time as to the products and technologies in which we invest and if we focus on products or technologies that do not perform in line with our strategic expectations or if market conditions change, our financial results could be adversely impacted. In February 2011 we announced our transformation strategy, which includes improving gross margins, exiting low margin products, introducing new products in secure and scalable storage, and organic and inorganic growth. In October 2012 we announced the acceleration of our transformation by reorganizing our businesses into two channel-focused business segments, and increasing our focus on data storage and data security. If we are not successful in implementing these strategies or if market conditions change adversely for our chosen products or technologies, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nThe future revenue growth of our business depends in part on the development and performance of our new products. We have experienced revenue declines over the prior year in 2014, 2013 and 2012 of $131.3 million or 15.3 percent, $145.9 million or 14.5 percent and $159.9 million or 13.7 percent, respectively. Historically, magnetic and optical products have provided the majority of our revenues. The overall market for these products has been impacted by industry wide dynamics, including competing formats as well as continuing improvements in compression and deduplication technologies. While demand for data capacity is expected to increase, removable magnetic media market size is expected to decrease in terms of revenue. Demand for optical media products is decreasing due to a shift in the use of data streaming and other media for storing data. If we are not successful in growing new product revenues, including revenues related to our acquisition of Nexsan and revenues from our portable workspace solutions, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nBecause of the rapid technology changes in our industry, we may not be able to compete if we cannot quickly develop, source, introduce and deliver differentiated and innovative products. We operate in a highly competitive environment against competitors who are both larger and smaller than us in terms of resources and market share. Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product introductions. In these highly competitive and changing markets, our success will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to continue to develop and introduce differentiated and innovative products cost-effectively and on a timely basis. The success of our offerings is dependent on several factors including our differentiation from competitive offerings, timing of new product introductions, effectiveness of marketing programs and maintaining low sourcing and supply chain costs. No assurance can be given with regard to our ability to anticipate and react to changes in market requirements, actions of competitors or the pace and direction of technology changes.\nWe may be dependent on third parties for new product introductions or technologies in order to introduce our own new products. We are dependent in some cases upon various third parties for the introduction and acceptance of new products, the timing of which is not entirely in our control. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will maintain existing relationships or forge new OEM relationships. There can also be no assurance that we will continue to have access to proprietary technologies through internal development and licensing arrangements with third parties, or that we will continue to have access to new competitive technologies that may be required to introduce new products. If we are not successful in maintaining and developing new relationships with OEMs or obtaining rights to use competitive technologies, we may become less competitive in certain markets.\nIf we do not successfully implement restructuring plans and realize the benefits expected from the restructuring, our financial results will be affected. From time to time we have initiated restructuring programs related to our business strategy to, among other things, reduce operating expenses and address product line rationalization and infrastructure. We may not be able to realize the expected benefits and cost savings if we do not successfully implement these plans. If we are unable to restructure our operations successfully as needed, or on a timely basis, our expectations of future results of operations, including certain cost savings expected to result from the restructuring, may not be met. If difficulties are encountered or such cost savings are otherwise not realized, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to economic risks including risk of foreign currency fluctuations and negative or uncertain global or regional economic conditions any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 65 percent of our 2014 revenue derived from operations outside of the United States. Our international operations may be subject to various risks which are not present in domestic operations, including political and economic instability, terrorist activity, the possibility of expropriation, trade tariffs or embargoes,\nunfavorable tax laws, restrictions on royalties, dividend and currency remittances, changes in foreign laws and regulations, requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers' councils. In addition, our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets. Changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand in our non-U.S. operations and export markets. Additionally, some of our international suppliers pay us quarterly or annual rebates based on the amount of purchases we make from them. If negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers' access to credit, product orders in these channels may decrease, which could result in lower revenue. Likewise, our suppliers may face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses. Foreign currency fluctuations can also affect reported profits of our non-U.S. operations where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. A recession in any of the regions we serve might affect product demand and cause fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates, including exchange rate volatility in the Euro and the Japanese Yen, may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. dollars. Given that the majority of our revenues are non-U.S. based, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe use third-party contract manufacturing services and supplier-provided parts, components, and sub-systems in our businesses and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. Our reliance on suppliers and third-party contract manufacturing to secure raw materials, parts and components used in our products exposes us to volatility in the price and availability of these materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third-party contract manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third-party contract manufacturer production disruptions, price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. Additionally, we may experience changes in the supply and cost of raw materials and key components of our products resulting from the effects of natural disasters. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. No assurances can be given that acceptable cost levels will continue in the future. In addition, some critical raw materials and key components have a limited number of suppliers. If we cannot obtain those raw materials or critical components from the suppliers, we will not be able to produce certain products.\nWe may engage in business combinations that are dilutive to existing shareholders, result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise harm our results of operations, and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses. We use financial assumptions and forecasts to determine the negotiated price we are willing to pay for an acquisition. If those financial assumptions and/or forecasts are not accurate, the price we pay may be too high, resulting in an inefficient use of cash and future goodwill impairment.\nNo assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses could materially harm our business and operating results. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that such products will be successful after the closing and will not cannibalize sales of our existing products, that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such company. Failed business combinations, or the efforts to create a business combination, can also result in litigation.\nAcquisitions may require capital infusions, typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of acquired companies. We may experience delays in the timing and successful integration of acquired technologies and product development, unanticipated costs and expenditures, changing relationships with customers, suppliers and strategic partners, or contractual, intellectual property or employment issues. In addition, key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us. The acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also result in our entering into a business market in which we have little or no prior experience. These challenges could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, harm our reputation, subject us to an increased risk of intellectual property and other litigation and increase our expenses.\nThese challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases, and we cannot ensure that we will realize the intended benefits of any acquisition. Acquisitions may require large one-time charges and can result in contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges, amortization of identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may incur asset impairment charges for intangible assets and goodwill in the future. We evaluate assets on our balance sheet, including such intangible assets and goodwill, annually as of November 30th or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We monitor factors or indicators, such as unfavorable variances from forecasted cash flows, established business plans or volatility inherent to external markets and industries that would require an impairment test. The test for impairment of intangible assets requires a comparison of the carrying value of the asset or asset group with their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the asset or asset group is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. The test for impairment of goodwill requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit for which goodwill is assigned with the fair value of the reporting unit calculated based on discounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value a second step is performed to calculate any impairment. See Note 6 - Intangible Assets and Goodwill in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our impairment of intangible assets.\nOur security products must provide appropriate levels of security to adequately store and protect our customers' data. Many of our secure storage products include software and hardware security such as user authentication, data encryption, and portable digital identities which are designed to prevent digital security breaches. Third parties may attempt to hack into our products in order to, among other things, compromise the integrity of those products or obtain confidential information. If our products do not provide adequate security and that security is compromised, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, experience increases in operating expenses, become subject to litigation and loss of reputation or suffer other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance that our efforts to upgrade the security of our products or develop new products to keep pace with continuing changes in technology will be successful or that product issues will not arise in the future. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption or destruction of our secure storage products could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe loss of a major customer, partner, or reseller would adversely affect us. Our future sales are dependent on the success of our customers, partners, and resellers, some of which operate in businesses associated with rapid technological change and consequent product obsolescence. We depend on the sales of our major customers, partners, and resellers and any material delay, cancellation or reduction of orders from these groups would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Developments adverse to our major customers, partners, and resellers or their products, or the failure of these groups to pay for components or services, would also have an adverse effect on us.\nChanges in European law or practice related to the imposition or collectability of optical levies could adversely affect us. Many European countries impose levies on imports of optical products and other products to compensate copyright owners for legal private copying. Imation is involved in litigation in several of those countries related to its obligation to pay levies on sales of our products to commercial channel customers. Based on current European law, we no longer pay levies on commercial channel sales. Because we have previously paid levies on such sales, we have offset certain levies payable on sales in the consumer channel with amounts previously overpaid with respect to commercial channel sales. If a court were to rule against us on this issue, we may be required to pay all, or a portion of, our unpaid levies to the collecting societies. In addition, any reduction in the current levy rates applicable to consumer channel sales could reduce our ability to offset for past overpayments on commercial channel sales. Other changes in levy rates or structures could impact our ability to compete in certain markets or otherwise reduce our profitability.\nIn a volatile global economic environment, demand and seasonality may result in our inability to accurately forecast our product purchase requirements. Sales of some of our products are subject to seasonality. For example, sales have typically increased in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, sometimes followed by significant declines in the first quarter of the following fiscal year. This seasonality makes it more difficult for us to forecast our business, especially in the volatile current global economic environment and its corresponding change in consumer confidence, which may impact typical seasonal trends. If our forecasts are inaccurate, we may lose market share due to product shortages or procure excess inventory or inappropriately increase or decrease our operating expenses, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. This seasonality also may lead to the need for working capital investments in receivables and inventory and our need to\nbuild inventory levels in advance of our most active selling seasons. The seasonality of our products could change as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures.\nSignificant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could affect our future earnings, equity and pension funding requirements. Pension obligations and related costs are determined using actual investment results as well as actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. Our funding requirements are based on these assumptions in addition to the performance of assets in the pension plans. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the long-term expected return on assets and mortality. Some of these assumptions, such as the discount rate, are largely outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings, equity and funding requirements.\nOur results of operations include our determinations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to changes in tax laws and regulations, and to inspection by various tax authorities. Changes in tax guidance and related interpretations as well as inspections by tax authorities could materially impact our tax receivables and payables and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions. Investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded. While we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional issues will arise from time to time. Our results may be affected by the outcome of such proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights and to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims of others. Claims may arise from time to time alleging that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in defending ourselves against those claims, we could incur substantial costs in implementing remediation actions, such as redesigning our products or processes, paying for license rights or paying to settle disputes. The related costs or the disruption to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nIn addition, we utilize valuable non-patented technical know-how and trade secrets in our product development. There can be no assurance that confidentiality agreements and other measures we utilize to protect such proprietary information will be effective, that these agreements will not be breached or that our competitors will not acquire the information as a result of or through independent development. We enforce our intellectual property rights against others who infringe those rights.\nAdditionally, our audio and data storage product categories are subject to allegations of patent infringement by our competitors as well as by non-practicing entities (NPEs), sometimes referred to as \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d who may seek monetary settlements from us.\nSignificant litigation matters could result in large costs. We are subject to various pending or threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of our business, especially regarding patents related to our audio and data storage products. We are often indemnified by our suppliers; litigation, however, is always subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable. We use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against us, but we have found there is a strong tendency toward litigation in the patent area in our industry and this litigation environment poses a business risk. We cannot ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of any monetary liability or financial impact that may be incurred by us in litigation.\nChanges in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access financing. Without such financing we may be unable to achieve our objectives for strategic acquisitions and internal growth. Disruption of the global financial and credit markets may have an effect on our long-term liquidity and financial condition. While we have been able to achieve our past acquisitions through operating cash flows and without permanently borrowing on our outstanding credit facilities, the need may arise to obtain additional funding. Based on our current plan of operations we believe our cash, when combined with our revolving line of credit available under our outstanding credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations for at least the next twelve months; however there is no assurance that circumstances will not change.\nThe agreement governing our credit facilities contains, and future debt agreements may contain, various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business. The agreement and instruments governing our outstanding credit facilities, and the agreements and instruments governing future debt agreements, may contain various restrictive covenants that, among other things, require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios that may restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur more debt;\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase stock, pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake unapproved acquisitions;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets; and\n\u2022\nmake fundamental changes in our corporate existence and principal business.\nIn addition, events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with and maintain the financial tests and ratios under our credit facilities. Any failure by us to comply with or maintain all applicable financial tests and ratios and to comply with all applicable covenants could result in an event of default with respect to our credit facilities or any other future debt agreements. An event of default could lead to the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding loans and the termination of the commitments to make further extensions of credit. Even if we are able to comply with all applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to operate our business at our sole discretion could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain employees and key talent our business and financial results may be materially impacted. We operate in a highly competitive market for employees with specialized skill, experience and industry knowledge. No assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain employees and key talent. A failure to attract and retain key personnel could also have a material adverse impact on our business.\nChanging laws and regulations have resulted in increased compliance costs for us, which could affect our operating results. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, regulations regarding conflict minerals and newly enacted SEC regulations have created additional compliance requirements. We are committed to maintaining high standards of internal controls over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources as necessary to comply with evolving standards which may result in increased expenses. Laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect the production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials and fuel could impact our business and financial results.\nWe rely on our aging information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed. The efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. Information systems are vulnerable to security breach by computer hackers and cyber terrorists. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. Any interruption or failure of our information systems or any breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe announcement of our review of strategic alternatives could adversely affect our business, financial results and operations, and there can be no assurance that any transaction will result from this review. On February 10, 2015, we announced that we have been working with Houlihan Lokey as our financial adviser to review and explore strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value and the value of each of our business units. There can be no assurance that this review will result in any transaction or any change to our overall structure or our business model, or that any transaction or change will enhance shareholder value or the value of any of our business units. Any transaction that is identified and pursued would be dependent on factors that may be beyond our control, including, among others, global economic conditions, the market environment, the possible\nrequirement for shareholder approval of the transaction, the interest of third parties in the Company or our businesses and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms or at all. We do not intend to provide updates or make any comments regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives unless our Board of Directors has approved a specific transaction or management otherwise deems disclosure appropriate. We expect to incur expenses associated with identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives. In addition, the process of reviewing strategic alternatives and implementing any course of action ultimately selected may be disruptive to the Company\u2019s business operations, may distract the Company\u2019s management team from their day-to-day responsibilities and could make it more difficult to retain customers, vendors and employees. Any of these risks or uncertainties could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting and other activist shareholder activities. On December 16, 2014, the Clinton Group and its affiliates submitted a notice of its intention to nominate three director candidates for election to the Board at our 2015 annual meeting of shareholders. If the Clinton Group does not withdraw its nominations or we are unable to reach an agreement with the Clinton Group relating to our 2015 annual meeting, a proxy contest is likely to occur. It is possible that directors nominated by the Clinton Group could constitute half of the Board following our 2015 annual meeting.\nA proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors. In addition, the potential of a proxy contest, or other activist shareholder activities, could interfere with our ability to execute our transformation or to identify or pursue strategic alternatives, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with key business partners, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, if the Clinton Group\u2019s nominees were to constitute half of the Board following our 2015 annual meeting, because any action by the Board requires the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the directors present and voting, it is possible that the Board would deadlock on certain issues. Further, such a change in a majority of the Board would result in a change of control under the severance and change of control agreements we have with our management and certain outstanding equity awards, which may trigger severance payments, change of control benefits, and/or the acceleration of those equity awards. A change in a majority of the Board will also result in a change of control under certain contracts with third parties including our credit agreements, if we are unable to secure appropriate waivers or amendments to any such contracts. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties described above or a threat of future stockholder activism.\nAdditionally, as part of its ongoing activist campaign, Spear Point Capital Fund LP and its affiliates filed a shareholder derivative action in Delaware Chancery Court on February 9, 2015 against the Company and the members of its Board of Directors. Plaintiffs contend that the defendants paid excessive compensation to the directors. They seek damages for breaches of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile. The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Any of the factors discussed above or such as the following may affect the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations by us or our competitors which may decrease the volume and profitability of sales of our existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence;\n\u2022\nnew products introduced by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nperiods of severe pricing pressures due to oversupply or price erosion resulting from competitive pressures or industry consolidation;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the consumer electronics and data storage industries;\n\u2022\ncontraction in our operating results or growth rates;\n\u2022\nthe potential impact of activist investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts relating specifically to us or the industries in which we participate in general; and\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions that affect the market generally.\nIn addition, general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies. These fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies.", "PERMNO": 83602, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "GLAE"}
