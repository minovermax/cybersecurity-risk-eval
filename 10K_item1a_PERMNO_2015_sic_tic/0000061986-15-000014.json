RISK FACTORS\nThe following are risk factors identified by management that if any events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, then our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR PROPOSED SEPARATION OF OUR CRANES AND FOODSERVICE BUSINESSES BY SPIN-OFF\nThe proposed separation of our cranes business and foodservice business is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, may require significant time and attention of our management, and may have a material adverse effect on us whether or not it is completed.\nOn January 29, 2015, we disclosed that our board of directors approved a plan to pursue a separation of our cranes business and foodservice business into two independent, publicly-traded companies through a spin-off. The proposed separation is subject to customary conditions, including, but not limited to, the receipt of legal opinions concerning the tax-free nature of the transaction, effectiveness of appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and final approval by our board of directors. In addition, unanticipated developments or changes in the macroeconomic environment, credit markets and equity markets, as well as other market conditions, may impact the plan to effect the proposed spin-off. For these and other reasons, we may not complete the spin-off as expected during the first quarter of 2016, or at all.\nWhether or not we complete the spin-off, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences as a result of pursuing the spin-off, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nexecution of the proposed spin-off will require significant time and attention from management, which may distract management from the operation of our businesses and the execution of other initiatives that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nour employees may be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with each of the separate companies pending the completion of the spin-off;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay significant costs and expenses relating to the spin-off, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees, whether or not it is completed; and\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the spin-off or fail to complete it on a timely basis.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spin-off.\nAlthough we believe that separating our foodservice business from our cranes business by means of the spin-off will provide financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to us and our shareholders, the spin-off may not provide such results on the scope or scale we anticipate, and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits. In addition, we will incur one-time costs and ongoing costs in connection with, or as a result of, the spin-off, including costs of operating as independent, publicly-traded companies that the two businesses will no longer be able to share. Those costs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize. If we do not realize the intended benefits of the spin-off or if our costs exceed our estimates, the company or the business that is spun off could suffer a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the proposed spin-off of our foodservice business is completed, the trading price of our common stock will decline.\nWe expect the trading price of our common stock immediately following the spin-off, which will only represent the value of our cranes business, to be significantly lower than immediately prior to the spin-off because the trading price for our common stock will no longer reflect the value of our foodservice business.\nFollowing the spin-off, the aggregate value of your common stock of (a) the company and (b) the business that is spun off may be less than the aggregate value at which the company's common stock might have traded had the spin-off not occurred.\nThe common stock of (a) the company and (b) the business that is spun off that you may hold following the spin-off may collectively trade at an aggregate value less than the value at which the company's common stock might have traded had the spin-off not occurred due to, among other factors, the expected or actual future performance of either the company or the business that is spun off as a separate, independent company and the future shareholder base and market for the company's common stock and the\nshares of the business that is spun off.\nThe proposed spin-off could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders.\nThe spin-off is conditioned on our receipt of an opinion of tax counsel that neither the company nor our shareholders will recognize any taxable income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the spin-off. However, this opinion will not be binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel. Moreover, the opinion of counsel will be based on certain statements and representations made by us, which, if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, could invalidate the opinion of counsel. Additionally, certain internal restructuring transactions necessary to accomplish the spin-off may result in adverse tax consequences to the company.\nIf the spin-off and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable, the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if the spin-off were taxable, each holder of our common stock who receives shares of the new spin-off company would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nSales of our products are cyclical and/or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors. A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors can have a material adverse effect on us.\nHistorically, sales of products that we manufacture and sell have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors. In particular, the demand for our Crane products is cyclical and is impacted by the strength of the economy generally, the availability of financing and other factors, including crude oil prices, that may have an effect on the level of construction activity on an international, national or regional basis. During periods of expansion in construction activity, we generally have benefited from increased demand for our products. Conversely, during recessionary periods, we have been adversely affected by reduced demand for our products. In addition, the strength of the economy generally may affect the rates of expansion, consolidation, renovation and equipment replacement within the restaurant, lodging, convenience store and healthcare industries, which may affect the performance of our Foodservice segment. Furthermore, any future economic recession may impact leveraged companies, such as Manitowoc, more than competing companies with less leverage and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProducts in our Crane segment also depend in part on federal, state, local and foreign governmental spending and appropriations, including infrastructure, security and defense outlays. Reductions in governmental spending can reduce demand for our products, which in turn can affect our performance. Weather conditions can substantially affect our Foodservice segment, as relatively cool summer weather and cooler-than-normal weather in hot climates tend to decrease sales of ice and beverage dispensers. Our sales depend in part upon our customers\u2019 replacement or repair cycles. Adverse economic conditions may cause customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently adjust to market conditions, among other potential adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we could fail to deliver on planned results, fall short of analyst and investor expectations, incur high fixed costs, and/or fail to benefit from higher than expected customer demand resulting in loss of market share.\nPrice increases in some materials and sources of supply could affect our profitability.\nWe use large amounts of steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper and electronic controls, among other items, in the manufacture of our products. Occasionally, market prices of some of our key raw materials increase significantly. If in the future we are not able to reduce product costs in other areas or pass raw material price increases on to our customers, our margins could be adversely affected. In addition, because we maintain limited raw material and component inventories, even brief unanticipated delays in delivery by suppliers - including those due to capacity constraints, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of suppliers, weather emergencies or other natural disasters - may impair our ability to satisfy our customers and could adversely affect our financial performance.\nTo better manage our exposures to certain commodity price fluctuations, we regularly hedge our commodity exposures through financial markets. Through this hedging program we fix the future price for a portion of these commodities utilized in the production of our products. To the extent that our hedging is not successful in fixing commodity prices that are favorable in comparison to market prices at the time of purchase, we would experience a negative impact on our profit margins compared to the margins we would have realized if these price commitments were not in place, which may adversely affect our results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.\nBecause we participate in industries that are intensely competitive, our net sales and profits could decline as we respond to competition.\nWe sell most of our products in highly competitive industries. We compete in each of those industries based on product design, quality of products, quality and responsiveness of product support services, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and distribution resources than we do. We cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to develop new and innovative products or if customers in our markets do not accept them, our results would be negatively affected.\nOur products must be kept current to meet our customers\u2019 needs. To remain competitive, we therefore must develop new and innovative products on an on-going basis. If we fail to make innovations, or the market does not accept our new products, our sales and results would suffer.\nWe invest significantly in the research and development of new products. These expenditures do not always result in products that will be accepted by the market. To the extent they do not, whether as a function of the product or the business cycle, we will have increased expenses without significant sales to benefit us. Failure to develop successful new products may also cause potential customers to choose to purchase used equipment or competitors\u2019 products, rather than invest in new products manufactured by us.\nWe depend on our key personnel and the loss of these personnel could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our key executives, managers and skilled personnel. Generally, these employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to retain our key officers and employees. We could be seriously harmed by the loss of key personnel if it were to occur in the future.\nWe have significant manufacturing and sales of our products outside of the United States, which may present additional risks to our business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately 49%, 51% and 53%, respectively, of our net sales were attributable to products sold outside of the United States. Expanding the company\u2019s international sales is part of our growth strategy. International operations generally are subject to various risks, including political, military, religious and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs, the impact of foreign government regulations, the effects of income and withholding tax, governmental expropriation, and differences in business practices. We may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with our international sales, manufacturing and the integration of new facilities that could cause loss of revenue or increased cost. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climate and currency devaluations of various foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA failure to meet customers\u2019 product quality and reliability standards/expectations may lead to increased or unexpected product warranty claims and other adverse consequences to our business.\nProduct quality and reliability are significant factors influencing customers' decisions to purchase our products. Inability to maintain the high quality of our products relative to the perceived or actual quality of similar products offered by competitors could result in the loss of market share or sales, an increase in warranty costs and/or damage to our reputation. We provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products we manufacture. Our warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from 12 months to 60 months with certain equipment having longer term warranties. If a product fails to comply with the warranty, we may be obligated, at our expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing the defective product. Although we maintain warranty reserves in an amount based primarily on the number of units shipped and on historical and anticipated warranty claims, there can be no assurance that future warranty claims will follow historical patterns or that we can accurately anticipate the level of future warranty claims. An increase in the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our customers rely on financing with third parties to purchase our products, and we may incur expenses associated with our assistance to customers in securing third party financing.\nA portion of our sales is financed by third-party finance companies on behalf of our customers. The availability of financing from third parties is affected by general economic conditions, the credit worthiness of our customers and the estimated residual value of our equipment. In certain transactions we provide residual value guarantees and buyback commitments to our customers or the third-party financial institutions. Deterioration in the credit quality of our customers or the overall health of the banking industry could negatively impact our customer\u2019s ability to obtain the resources needed to make purchases of our equipment or their ability to obtain third-party financing. In addition, if the actual value of the equipment for which we have provided a residual value guaranty declines below the amount of our guaranty, we may incur additional costs, which may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations and profitability could suffer if we experience problems with labor relations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 12,300 people and had labor agreements with 13 local unions in North America. A large majority of our European employees belong to European trade unions. We have three trade unions in China and one trade union in India. During 2014, four of our union contracts expired at various times. All four of the contracts that expired in 2014 were successfully renegotiated without incident. Any significant labor relations issues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In 2015 we have two union contracts that expire. Any significant labor relations issues could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur leverage may impair our operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total consolidated debt was $1,523.5 million as compared to consolidated debt of $1,526.8 million as of December 31, 2013, including the value of related interest rate hedging instruments. Our debt could have important consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest rather than to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate.\nThe agreements governing our debt include covenants that restrict, among other matters, our ability to incur additional debt; pay dividends on or repurchase our equity; make investments; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, our Senior Credit Facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants may also require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. We cannot be certain that we will meet any future financial tests or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet those tests. See additional discussion in Note 11, \u201cDebt,\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we default under our debt agreements, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and could proceed against any collateral securing the debt. Under those circumstances, in the absence of readily-available refinancing on favorable terms, we might elect or be compelled to enter bankruptcy proceedings, in which case our shareholders could lose the entire value of their investment in our common stock.\nAn inability to successfully manage the implementation of a global enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system in our Crane segment could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new global ERP system in the Crane segment. This system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems. Such an implementation is a major undertaking both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Should the system not be implemented successfully and within budget, or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner, it could be disruptive and adversely affect our operations and results of operations, including the ability of the company to report accurate and timely financial results.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products, especially our crane products. Certain of our businesses also have experienced claims relating to past asbestos\nexposure. Neither we nor our affiliates have to date incurred material costs related to these asbestos claims. We vigorously defend ourselves against current claims and intend to do so against future claims. However, a substantial increase in the number of claims that are made against us or the amounts of any judgments or settlements could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or maintain our rights to use licensed intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur patents, trademarks and licenses are important in the operation of our businesses. Although we intend to protect our intellectual property rights vigorously, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in doing so. Third parties may assert or prosecute infringement claims against us in connection with the services and products that we offer, and we may or may not be able to successfully defend these claims. Litigation, either to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others, could result in substantial costs and in a diversion of our resources. In addition, if a third party would prevail in an infringement claim against us, then we would likely need to obtain a license from the third party on commercial terms, which would likely increase our costs. Our failure to maintain or obtain necessary licenses or an adverse outcome in any litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nStrategic divestitures could negatively affect our results.\nWe regularly review our business units and evaluate them against our core business strategies. In addition to strategic divestiture decisions, at times we may be required by regulatory authorities to make business divestitures as a result of acquisition transactions. As a result, we regularly consider the divestiture of non-core and non-strategic, or acquisition-related operations or facilities. Depending upon the circumstances and terms, the divestiture of an operation or facility could negatively affect our earnings from continuing operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations.\nSome of our operations are or will be conducted by subsidiaries in foreign countries. The results of the operations and the financial position of these subsidiaries will be reported in the relevant foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements, which are stated in U.S. dollars. The exchange rates between many of these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Such fluctuations may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nIn addition, we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a transaction using a different currency than its functional currency. We attempt to reduce currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a material transaction using a different currency than its functional currency by:\n\u2022 matching cash flows and payments in the same currency;\n\u2022 direct foreign currency borrowing; and\n\u2022 entering into foreign exchange contracts for hedging purposes.\nHowever, we may not be able to hedge this risk completely or at an acceptable cost, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.\nOur income tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities, and the final determination of our tax liability with respect to tax audits and any related litigation could adversely affect our financial results.\nAlthough we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, and/or interest assessments. We are undergoing tax audits in various jurisdictions and we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves.\nOur business and/or reputation could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nCertain of our shareholders have publicly or privately expressed views with respect to the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations or other matters that may not be fully aligned with our own. Responding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our reputation, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified directors, personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.\nActivist shareholders have made, and may in the future make, strategic proposals, suggestions, or requests for changes concerning the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations, or other matters. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any consequences arising from these actions, and any such consequences may impact the value of our securities.\nEnvironmental liabilities that may arise in the future could be material to us.\nOur operations, facilities and properties are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination, and otherwise relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment. As a result, we are involved from time to time in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental and health and safety matters, and have in the past and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures relating to such matters.\nBased on current information, we believe that any costs we may incur relating to environmental matters will not be material, although we can give no assurances. We also cannot be certain that identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities, or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and give rise to additional environmental liabilities, compliance costs and/or penalties that could be material. Further, environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect they may have upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our internal and external data centers, cloud services, and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our partners, may be vulnerable to malicious attacks or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including as a result of rollouts of new systems. Any such breach or operational failure would compromise our networks and/or that of our partners and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and/or regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and/or cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur inability to recover from natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and financial results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, national emergencies, significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, war or terrorist activities that could curtail production at our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and canceled orders. In addition, we purchase components and raw materials and information technology and other services from numerous suppliers, and, even if our facilities were not directly affected by such events, we could be affected by interruptions at such suppliers. Such suppliers may be less likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations. We cannot assure you that we will have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe must comply with all applicable international trade, customs, export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations\nof the United States and other countries. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Changes in trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violation of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions or fines and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompliance with regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) rules require disclosures related to the use of certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries (\u201cconflict minerals\u201d) that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. The metals covered by the rules, are commonly referred to as \u201c3TG\u201d and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. The disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals used in the manufacture of our products. Our supply chain is complex, and if we are not able to conclusively verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products or that our products are \u201cconflict free,\u201d we may face reputational challenges with our customers or investors. Furthermore, we may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that our products be certified as \u201cconflict free,\u201d which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. We could incur significant costs related to the compliance process, and face costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements.", "PERMNO": 51263, "SIC": 3530, "TIC": "MTW"}
