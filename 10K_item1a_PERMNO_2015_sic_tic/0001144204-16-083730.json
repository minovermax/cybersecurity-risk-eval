RISK FACTORS An investment in our shares involves a number of risks. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and could cause a corresponding decline in the market price of our shares.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations Fluctuations in economic, equity and credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms. Should the economic, equity and credit market conditions become disrupted, our ability to raise equity or obtain capital, to repay or refinance credit facilities at maturity, pay significant capital expenditures or fund growth may be costly and/or impaired. Our access to debt financing in particular will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit history and credit capacity, as well as the historical performance of our businesses and lender perceptions of their and our financial prospects. In the event that we are unable to obtain debt financing, particularly as significant credit facilities mature, our internal sources of liquidity may not be sufficient.\nEconomic conditions may also increase our counterparty risk, particularly in those businesses whose revenues are determined under multi-year contracts, such as IMTT, and businesses within our CP&E segment. Should conditions deteriorate, we would expect to see increases in counterparty defaults and/or bankruptcies, which could result in an increase in bad debt expense and may cause our operating results to decline.\nThe volatility in the financial markets makes projections regarding future obligations under pension plans difficult. Two of our businesses, Hawaii Gas and IMTT, have defined benefit retirement plans. Future funding obligations under those plans depend in large part on the future performance of plan assets and the mix of investment assets. Our defined benefit plans hold a significant amount of equity securities as well as fixed income securities. If the market values of these securities decline or if interest rates decline, our pension expense and cash funding requirements would increase and, as a result, could materially adversely affect the results and liquidity of these businesses and our Company.\nThe documents governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions. The senior secured revolving credit facility imposes, and future debt agreements may impose, operational and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 pay dividends, redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022 make certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022 grant or permit certain liens on our assets;\n\u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022 transfer or sell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries.\nThese covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, engage in business activities, including future opportunities that may be in our interest, and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness. Acceleration of our other indebtedness could result in a default under the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility or our convertible senior notes. There is no guarantee that we would be able to satisfy our obligations if any of our indebtedness is accelerated.\nOur strategy includes an expectation that we will find, acquire or develop, and integrate, additional businesses. Although our businesses tend to benefit from stable fundamental drivers of growth over time, we will attempt to augment that growth by finding, acquiring or developing, and integrating additional businesses. We may not find or be able to acquire such businesses on economically sensible terms. In addition, we may acquire businesses with financial reporting and control systems that are less sophisticated than ours. If we do make an acquisition, we may not be successful in integrating it into our portfolio and/or achieving the expected level of performance. If we invest capital on a development, we may not be successful in the execution of the full project or in integrating it into our portfolio and/or achieving the expected level of performance. Failure to do any of these could result in higher indebtedness or expenses and/or in generating less cash than expected or generating growing amounts of cash at a slower than anticipated rate, either of which could result in a reduction in our share price.\nThe ownership and operation of our CP&E facilities exposes us to certain risks and hazards that could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations and we may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards. BEC connects to a 6.5 mile, 345-kilovolt submarine power line under the NYH connecting with a Consolidated Edison substation in Brooklyn, New York. The submarine power line is the longest extruded extra-high voltage submarine cable ever manufactured.\nIn addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, the generation of power in Bayonne and its transmission of power from Bayonne to Brooklyn via the submarine cable exposes us to other hazards such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and equipment failure both in respect of BEC and our adjacent Bayonne operations at IMTT. The occurrence of any of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties. While we maintain an amount of insurance protection that we consider adequate, we cannot provide any assurance that this insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A successful claim for which our Company is not fully insured could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide any assurance that this insurance coverage will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs part of our acquisition of BEC, we announced our intention to add incremental generating capacity on land owned by our IMTT business adjacent to the existing facility. While we have received preliminary reports indicating that the existing submarine cable is capable of transmitting both the existing and incremental electricity to Brooklyn, should our Company not be able to transmit either the current power or the incremental power via the existing cable it may adversely affect our Company.\nDecreasing the proportion of businesses in our portfolio that are not regulated or of a predominantly contracted nature increases the potential volatility in our financial results. With the exception of our airport services business, our businesses generally possess certain characteristics including high barriers to entry, generally stable demand, long-term contracts/concessions, stable yields, regulated operations, and inflation linked revenue. Our airport services business generates revenue and distributable cash in a way that is broadly reflective of the economic health of the country. To the extent we invest in or acquire or develop businesses with revenue and cash generating capacity that is similarly GDP sensitive or businesses that do not possess these characteristics, our financial results could become more volatile and our share price could decline as a result of an increase in the real or perceived risk.\nIf borrowing costs increase or if debt terms become more restrictive, the cost of refinancing and servicing our debt will increase, reducing our profitability and ability to freely deploy capital or pay dividends to shareholders. The majority of our indebtedness matures within three to six years. Refinancing this debt may result in substantially higher interest rates or margins or substantially more restrictive covenants. Any of these could\nlimit operational flexibility or reduce dividends and/or distributions from our operating businesses to us, which would have an adverse impact on our ability to freely deploy capital and continue to maintain or grow dividends to our shareholders. We cannot provide assurance that we or the other owners of any of our businesses will be willing or able to make capital contributions to repay some or all of the debt if required.\nOur holding company level debt could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business. In 2014, we issued $350.0 million of convertible senior notes and entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility. This holding company level debt increases our interest payments and could have significant effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022 we may be required to use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay interest on our indebtedness which will reduce the funds available for dividends to shareholders, additional acquisitions, pursuit of business opportunities or other business purposes;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired;\n\u2022 it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under our contractual and commercial commitments;\n\u2022 our increased level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022 exposing us to risk of increased interest rates because any borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022 our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited; and\n\u2022 our indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our businesses.\nWe expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and to repay our indebtedness primarily from our operating businesses. Our ability to meet our expenses and make these payments therefore depends on the future performance of our businesses, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in our inability to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. As a holding company with no operations, we are dependent on the ability of our businesses to make distributions to us to pay our expenses and repay our indebtedness. In addition, the senior secured revolving credit facility is guaranteed by MIC Ohana Corporation, our direct, wholly owned subsidiary. MIC Ohana Corporation is a holding company whose only material asset is the capital stock of our other subsidiaries. If we do not have enough funds, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more funds, which we may not be able to accomplish on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nWe and any of our existing or future subsidiaries may incur substantially more indebtedness in the future. This could further exacerbate the risks to our business as described herein. We and any of our existing and future subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of our senior secured revolving credit facility contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility, the holders of that additional debt will be entitled to share ratably with the lenders or holders of the indebtedness under the senior secured revolving credit facility in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our Company. If new debt is added to our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could be exacerbated.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel, or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees, could have an adverse effect on our consolidating businesses, financial condition and results of operations. We operate our consolidating businesses on a stand-alone basis, relying on existing management teams for day-to-day operations. Consequently, our operational success, as well as the success of our internal growth strategy, will be dependent on the continued efforts of the management teams of our consolidating businesses, who have extensive experience in the day-to-day operations of these businesses. Furthermore, we will likely be dependent on the operating management teams of businesses that we may acquire in the future. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe own, and may acquire in the future, investments in which we share voting control and, consequently, our ability to exercise significant influence over the business may be limited. While it is our preference to own our businesses outright or to be able to exercise significant influence over our investments, including with respect to the timing and amount of distributions to us from those businesses, we may in some cases find the potential economic benefits of owning less than a controlling interest to be compelling. In such cases, we will attempt to co-invest with like-minded individuals/organizations. However, there can be no certainty that our interests with such co-investor(s) will always be aligned or that we will always be in a position to determine the amount and timing of distributions from such investments.\nDisputes with a prior co-investor has resulted in our being involved in an arbitration proceeding. While we prevailed in this arbitration, it was costly and diverted the attention of our management and there was a delay associated with receipt of the benefits to which we were entitled.\nOur ability to influence a joint venture business is typically governed by (and may be limited to) our rights under a shareholders\u2019 agreement. We may not directly manage the day-to-day operations of a joint venture, and we may not be provided with notice of material events with respect such joint venture businesses (including, without limitation, potential liabilities for environmental health and safety (EHS) matters) in as timely a manner and with the same level of detail as we would if we were in such a day-to-day management role.\nIf we do not manage the day-to-day operations of a joint venture, we may not have complete visibility into operational and financial systems, controls or processes, including among others, as they relate to EHS measures. We may not be able to evaluate whether such financial, operational, or EHS systems or controls are sufficiently robust or executed appropriately.\nOur businesses are subject to environmental risks that may impact our future profitability. Our businesses (including businesses in which we invest) are subject to numerous statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection. Atlantic Aviation is subject to environmental protection requirements relating to the storage, transport, pumping and transfer of fuel. Hawaii Gas is subject to risks and hazards associated with the refining, handling, storage and transportation of combustible products. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury, loss of life, damage or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage. Any losses we face could be greater than insurance levels maintained by our businesses, which could have an adverse effect on their and our financial results. In addition, disruptions to physical assets could reduce our ability to serve customers and adversely affect sales and cash flows.\nIMTT\u2019s and BEC\u2019s operations in particular are subject to complex, stringent and expensive environmental regulations, including compliance with emission limitations and/or air permits, and future compliance costs are difficult to estimate with certainty. IMTT also faces risks relating to the handling and transportation of significant amounts of hazardous materials. Failure to comply with regulations or other claims may give rise to interruptions in operations and civil or criminal penalties and liabilities that could adversely affect the profitability of this business and the distributions it makes to us, as could significant unexpected compliance\ncosts. Further, these rules and regulations are subject to change and compliance with any changes could result in a restriction of the activities of our businesses, significant capital expenditures and/or increased ongoing operating costs.\nA number of the properties owned by IMTT have been subject to environmental contamination in the past and require remediation for which IMTT is liable. These remediation obligations exist principally at IMTT\u2019s Bayonne and Lemont facilities and could cost more than anticipated or could be incurred earlier than anticipated, or both. In addition, IMTT may discover additional environmental contamination at its Bayonne, Lemont or other facilities that may require remediation at significant cost to IMTT. Further, the past contamination of the properties owned by IMTT, including by former owners or operators of such properties, could result in remediation obligations, personal injury, property damage, environmental damage or similar claims by third parties.\nWe may also be required to address other prior or future environmental contamination, including soil and groundwater contamination that results from the spillage of fuel, hazardous materials or other pollutants. Under various federal, state, local and foreign environmental statutes, rules and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for noncompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety requirements and for the costs of investigation, monitoring, removal or remediation of hazardous materials. These laws often impose liability, whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of those materials at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person and whether or not the original disposal or treatment activity accorded with all regulatory requirements. The presence of hazardous materials on a property could result in personal injury, loss of life, damage or destruction of property and equipment, environmental damage and/or claims by third parties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nOur income may be affected adversely if additional compliance costs are required as a result of new safety, health or environmental regulation. Our businesses are subject to federal, state and local safety, health and environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect all aspects of their operations and are frequently modified. There is a risk that any one of our businesses may not be able to comply with some aspect of these laws and regulations, resulting in fines or penalties. Additionally, if new laws and regulations are adopted or if interpretations of existing laws and regulations change, we could be required to increase capital spending and incur increased operating expenses in order to comply. Because the regulatory environment frequently changes, we cannot predict when or how we may be affected by such changes. Environmental emissions and other compliance testing technologies continue to improve, which may result in more stringent, targeted environmental regulations and compliance obligations in the future, for example at IMTT, the costs of which could be material and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur businesses are dependent on our relationships, on a contractual and regulatory level, with government entities that may have significant leverage over us. Government entities may be influenced by political considerations to take actions adverse to us. Our businesses generally are, and will continue to be, subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies. In addition, our businesses rely on obtaining and maintaining government permits, licenses, concessions, leases or contracts. Government entities, due to the wide-ranging scope of their authority, have significant leverage over us in their contractual and regulatory relationships with us that they may exercise in a manner that causes us delays in the operation of our businesses or pursuit of our strategy, or increased administrative expense. Furthermore, government permits, licenses, concessions, leases and contracts are generally very complex, which may result in periods of non-compliance, or disputes over interpretation or enforceability. If we fail to comply with these regulations or contractual obligations, we could be subject to monetary penalties or we may lose our rights to operate the affected business, or both. Where our ability to operate a business is subject to a concession or lease from the government, the concession or lease may restrict our ability to operate the business in a way that maximizes cash flows and profitability. Further, our ability to grow our current and future businesses will often require consent of numerous government\nregulators. Increased regulation restricting the ownership or management of U.S. assets by non-U.S. persons, given the non-U.S. ultimate ownership of our Manager, may limit our ability to pursue acquisitions. Any such regulation may also limit our Manager\u2019s ability to continue to manage our operations, which could cause disruption to our businesses and a decline in our performance. In addition, any required government consents may be costly to seek and we may not be able to obtain them. Failure to obtain any required consents could limit our ability to achieve our growth strategy.\nOur contracts with government entities may also contain clauses more favorable to the government counterparty than a typical commercial contract. For instance, a lease, concession or general service contract may enable the government to terminate the agreement without requiring them to pay adequate compensation. In addition, government counterparties also may have the discretion to change or increase regulation of our operations, or implement laws or regulations affecting our operations, separate from any contractual rights they may have. Governments have considerable discretion in implementing regulations that could impact these businesses. Governments may be influenced by political considerations to take actions that may hinder the efficient and profitable operation of our businesses.\nMany of our contracts, especially those with government entities or quasi-government entities are long-term contracts. These long-term contracts may be difficult to replace if terminated. In addition, buy-out or other early termination provisions could adversely affect our results of operations if exercised before the end of the contract.\nGovernmental agencies may determine the prices we charge and may be able to restrict our ability to operate our businesses to maximize profitability. Where our businesses are sole or predominant service providers in their respective service areas and provide services that are essential to the community, they are likely to be subject to rate regulation by governmental agencies that will determine the prices they may charge. We may also face fees or other charges imposed by government agencies that increase our costs and over which we have no control. We may be subject to increases in fees or unfavorable price determinations that may be final with no right of appeal or that, despite a right of appeal, could result in our profits being negatively affected. In addition, we may have very little negotiating leverage in establishing contracts with government entities, which may decrease the prices that we otherwise might be able to charge or the terms upon which we provide products or services. Businesses we acquire in the future may also be subject to rate regulation or similar negotiating limitations.\nUnfavorable publicity or public perception of the industries in which we operate could adversely impact our operating results and our reputation. Accidents and incidents involving the aviation industry, particularly those involving the airports and heliport at which we operate, whether or not directly related to our Company\u2019s services, and the media coverage thereof, can adversely impact our Company\u2019s reputation and the demand for our services. Similarly, negative publicity or public perception of the energy-related industries in which we operate, including through media coverage of environmental contamination and climate change concerns, could reduce demand for our services and harm our reputation. Any reduction in demand for the services our businesses provide or damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects.\nA significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the revenue of a number of our businesses. A significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the profitability of a number of our businesses. Higher prices for jet fuel could result in less use of aircraft by GA customers, which would have a negative impact on the profitability of Atlantic Aviation. Higher fuel prices could increase the cost of power to our businesses generally which they may not be able to fully pass on to customers.\nA sustained period of low energy prices may foreshadow a downturn in economic activity, and capital investment in particular, that could have a negative impact on the performance and prospects of one or more of our businesses. A period of low energy prices, or what has been characterized as an \u201coil\u201d or \u201cenergy\u201d glut, may not drive an increase in economic activity and capital investment. If instead it results in a lack of growth in\neconomic activity and capital investment, and/or a slowing of the economy, demand for products and services provided by our airport services and/or bulk liquid terminal businesses may flatten or decline. A decline in the performance of these businesses could result in a decline in the value of our shares.\nRevenue, cost of services/goods sold and gross profit may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices at our business segments. Revenue at our Atlantic Aviation and Hawaii Gas business segments is generated primarily from the re-sale of a commodity. Accordingly, fluctuations in the underlying cost of the commodity may be reflected in a similar movement in revenue and cost of services/goods sold such that:\n\u2022 a decline in the commodity price (assuming constant volume) may result in a decline in revenue and a corresponding decline in the cost of services/goods sold; and\n\u2022 an increase in the commodity price (assuming constant volume) may result in an increase in revenue and an increase in the cost of services/goods sold.\nThis volatility may or may not be apparent in our consolidated results given (i) revenue, costs of services/goods sold and gross profit in our segments may not exhibit the same degree of commodity price fluctuation (for example, the majority of revenues in our IMTT and CP&E segments are contracted revenues); (ii) the commodities sold in our Atlantic Aviation and Hawaii Gas segments may not exhibit the same degree of volatility; and (iii) such commodities may not do so simultaneously.\nEnergy efficiency and technology advances, as well as conservation efforts and changes in the sources and types of energy produced in the U.S. may result in reduced demand for our products and services. The trends toward increased conservation, as well as technological advances including installation of improved insulation, the development of more efficient heating and cooling devices and advances in energy generation technology, may reduce demand for certain of our products and services. During periods of high energy commodity costs, the prices of certain of our products and services generally increase, which may lead to customer conversation. In addition, federal and/or state regulation may require mandatory conservation measures, which would also reduce demand.\nThe discovery and development of new and unconventional energy sources in the U.S. may drive changes in related energy product logistics chains. The location and exploitation of these new energy sources could result in the dislocation of certain portions of some of our businesses. Either or both of these changes in energy supply chain logistics or trends toward increased conservation could reduce demand for our products and services and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nEach of our businesses experience a measure of seasonality and such seasonality may cause fluctuations in our results of operations. Although our businesses tend to produce stable financial results owing to a preponderance of contracted/concession based revenues and the provision of generally essential services, each operates in an environment which can generate seasonal variations in results. Our bulk liquid terminals business may generate incrementally more cash during cold weather months as a result of increased heating, throughput of certain products such as heating oil or the reduction in maintenance expenses. Our aviation services business may generate relatively more cash during cold weather months as a result of increased GA traffic into bases in Florida and intermountain West. Our BEC gas power facility generates more cash during periods of extreme temperature. Our solar power facilities may generate incrementally more cash during summer months when the number of daylight hours increases. Our gas production and distribution business may generate incrementally more cash during the peak tourism periods in Hawaii between mid-December and the end of March and from mid-June through mid-September. To the extent that our businesses collectively appear to generate more cash in the first quarter of the year, such performance, if annualized, could result in an overly optimistic estimate of the value of our shares.\nSecurity breaches or interruptions in our information systems could materially adversely affect our business. We rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information used to operate our businesses. We also share certain information technology networks with our Manager. The information technology we use, as well as the information technology systems used by our Manager, could be vulnerable to security breach, damage or interruption from computer viruses, cyber attacks, cyber terrorism, natural disasters or telecommunications failures. If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and confidential data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets. Climate change is receiving increased attention and there is an ongoing debate as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the possible causes of this change and its potential impacts. Some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome of federal and state actions to address global climate change could result in significant new regulations, additional changes to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions. These actions could increase the costs of operating our businesses, reduce the demand for our products and services and impact the prices we charge our customers, any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, climate change could make severe weather events more frequent, which would increase the likelihood of capital expenditures to replace damaged physical property at our businesses.\nWe may face a greater exposure to terrorism than other companies because of the nature of our businesses. We believe that our businesses face a greater risk of terrorist attack than other businesses, particularly our operations within the immediate vicinity of metropolitan and suburban areas. Because our businesses provide basic services relied on by many people, our facilities may be at greater risk for terrorism attacks than other businesses, which could affect our operations significantly. Any terrorist attacks that occur at or near our business locations would be likely to cause significant harm to our employees and assets. In recent years, insurers have significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events. A terrorist attack that makes use of our property, or property under our control, may result in liability far in excess of available insurance coverage. In addition, any terrorist attack, regardless of location, could cause a disruption to our business and a decline in earnings. Furthermore, it is likely to result in an increase in insurance premiums and a reduction in coverage, which could cause our profitability to suffer.\nRisks Related to IMTT IMTT\u2019s business is dependent on the demand for bulk liquid terminals capacity in the locations where it operates. Demand for IMTT\u2019s bulk liquid terminals is largely a function of demand for chemical, petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products and, less significantly, the extent to which such products are imported into and/or exported out of the United States. Demand for chemical, petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products is influenced by a number of factors, including economic conditions, growth in the economy, the absolute and relative pricing of chemical, petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products and their substitutes. Import and export volumes of these products to and from the United States are influenced by demand and supply imbalances in the United States and overseas, the cost of producing chemical, petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products domestically versus overseas and the cost of transporting the products between the United States and overseas destinations.\nSpecifically, increased production of natural gas or crude from mainland North America, the volatility of global crude prices or the lifting of the U.S. ban on crude oil exports may increase or decrease the demand for bulk liquid terminals. This situation continues to develop and the effects are not yet predictable.\nIn addition, changes in government regulations that affect imports and exports of bulk chemical, petroleum, renewable fuels and vegetable and animal oil products, including the imposition of surcharges or taxes on imported or exported products, could adversely affect import and export volumes to and from the United States. A reduction in demand for bulk liquid terminals, particularly in NYH or the Lower Mississippi River, as a consequence of lower demand for, or imports/exports of, chemical, petroleum or vegetable and animal oil products, could lead to a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented out by IMTT and adversely affect IMTT\u2019s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us.\nIMTT\u2019s business could be adversely affected by a substantial change in bulk liquid terminal or refining capacity or demand in the locations where it operates or in other alternative or substitute locations. An increase in available bulk liquid terminal capacity in excess of growth in demand for such storage in the key locations in which IMTT operates, such as NYH and the Lower Mississippi River, or in Houston or other parts of the Gulf Coast could result in overcapacity and a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented out by IMTT and could adversely affect IMTT\u2019s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us.\nThe interplay and proximity of terminal capacity, refining and end user demand is critical for the commercial viability of a terminal. Shifts in any of these factors may cause a decline in demand for our terminals or make other terminals more attractive, which could adversely affect IMTT\u2019s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us.\nIf IMTT does not deploy capital for growth or make such deployment on economically acceptable terms, any future growth of the business may be limited. A portion of IMTT\u2019s historical growth has been dependent on the deployment of growth capital. IMTT faces significant uncertainties and competition in the pursuit of growth opportunities. For example, decisions regarding new growth projects rely on numerous estimates, including among other factors, predictions of future demand for IMTT\u2019s services, future supply shifts, crude oil production estimates, commodity price environments, economic conditions and potential changes in the financial condition of IMTT\u2019s customers. IMTT\u2019s predictions of such factors could cause it to forego certain investments or to lose opportunities to competitors who make investments based on more aggressive predictions. If IMTT cannot find projects with economically acceptable terms, future growth of this business may be limited.\nA continued or sustained decrease in the global price of crude oil and its derivative products may negatively impact IMTT\u2019s operations. A decrease in oil prices over a long period of time may result in reduced demand for the services IMTT provides. Uncertainty in the oil markets may also result in IMTT\u2019s customers entering into shorter term contracts for storage than they have previously. This would increase the frequency of customer contract renewals and negotiations and may result in more volatility in earnings.\nIMTT customers who are negatively impacted by reduced oil prices may seek to renegotiate contract pricing or storage capacity in order to reduce operating costs. Low oil prices may also result in a lower level of growth capital expenditures by IMTT as its customers may not require additional storage or logistics assets and this may limit IMTT\u2019s future growth. IMTT\u2019s customer base includes large, multinational oil companies. If oil prices remain low or decline further, one or more of these companies could cease operations or be consolidated. This could result in a loss of customers and/or a consolidation among customers and may reduce IMTT\u2019s revenue or concentrate counterparties to the point where the loss of any one could be material to the performance or prospects of the business.\nIMTT\u2019s agreements may be terminated or expire at the end of the current term upon requisite notice or renewed on different terms. If one or more of the current agreements is terminated and IMTT is unable to secure comparable alternative arrangements, its financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Upon expiration, agreements can generally be terminated by either party, though some agreements require the giving of requisite notice. Changing market conditions, including changes in petroleum product supply or demand patterns, forward-price structure, financial market conditions, regulations, accounting rules or other\nfactors could cause IMTT\u2019s customers to be unwilling to renew their storage agreements when those agreements terminate, or make them willing to renew only at lower rates or for shorter periods. If any of IMTT\u2019s agreements are terminated or expire and IMTT is unable to secure comparable alternative arrangements, IMTT may not be able to generate sufficient additional revenue from third parties to replace any shortfall. Additionally, IMTT may incur substantial costs if modifications to its terminals are required by a new or renegotiated agreement.\nIMTT could incur significant costs and liabilities in responding to contamination that occurs at its facilities. There is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in IMTT\u2019s operations due to its handling of petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes, because of air emissions, water discharges and waste practices related to its operations, and as a result of historical operations and waste disposal practices of prior owners of IMTT\u2019s facilities. IMTT\u2019s pipeline and terminal facilities have been used for transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil, refined petroleum products and chemicals for many years. Although IMTT has utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, refined petroleum products or crude oil, hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes from time to time have been spilled or released on or under the terminal properties.\nIn addition, the terminal properties were previously owned and operated by other parties and those parties from time to time also have spilled or released refined petroleum products or crude oil, hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes. The terminal properties are subject to federal, state and local laws that impose investigatory, corrective action and remedial obligations, some of which are joint and several or strict liability obligations without regard to fault, to address and prevent environmental contamination. IMTT may incur significant costs and liabilities in responding to any soil and groundwater contamination that occurs on its properties, even if the contamination was caused by prior owners and operators of its facilities. IMTT may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance or other sources of contractual indemnity. To the extent that the costs associated with meeting any or all of these requirements are substantial and not adequately provided for, there could be a material adverse effect on IMTT\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIMTT may incur significant costs and liabilities in complying with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. IMTT\u2019s operations involve the transportation and storage of petroleum and chemical products which are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing release of materials and vapors into the environment, occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Compliance with this array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations is difficult and may require significant capital expenditures and operating costs to mitigate or prevent pollution. Moreover, IMTT\u2019s business is subject to spills, discharges or other releases of petroleum or chemical products or other hazardous substances or wastes into the environment and neighboring areas, in which events joint and several, strict liability may be imposed against us under certain environmental laws for costs required to remediate and restore impacted properties, for claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury, natural resource and property damages, and for costs required to conduct health studies. Failure to comply with applicable environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including fines, administrative, civil or criminal penalties, and permit revocations, the imposition of investigatory, corrective action, or remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of IMTT\u2019s operations.\nNew laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, increased government enforcement or other developments could require IMTT to make additional expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. IMTT is not able to predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations or how such legal requirements are interpreted or enforced, but any such expenditures or costs for environmental and occupational health and safety compliance could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nIMTT\u2019s business involves hazardous activities and is partly located in a region with a history of significant adverse weather events and is potentially a target for terrorist attacks. We cannot assure that IMTT is, or will be in the future, adequately insured against all such risks. The transportation, handling and storage of petroleum, chemical and vegetable and animal oil products are subject to the risk of spills, leakage, contamination, fires and explosions. Any of these events may result in loss of revenue, loss of reputation or goodwill, fines, penalties and other liabilities. In certain circumstances, such events could also require IMTT to halt or significantly alter operations at all or part of the facility at which the event occurred. IMTT carries insurance to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of the business; however, the limits of IMTT\u2019s coverage mean IMTT cannot insure against all risks. In addition, because IMTT\u2019s facilities are not insured against loss from terrorism or acts of war, such an attack that significantly damages one or more of IMTT\u2019s major facilities would have a negative impact on IMTT\u2019s future cash flow and profitability and the distributions it makes to us. Further, future losses sustained by insurers during hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf and Northeast regions may result in lower insurance coverage and/or increased insurance premiums for IMTT\u2019s properties.\nMany of IMTT\u2019s facilities have been in service for several decades. Costs of maintaining those facilities could adversely affect IMTT\u2019s results of operations. IMTT\u2019s terminals are generally long-lived assets. Some of those assets have been in service for several decades. The age and condition of these terminals could result in increased maintenance or remediation expenditures and an increased risk of product releases and associated costs and liabilities. Any significant increase in these expenditures, costs or liabilities could materially adversely affect IMTT\u2019s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIMTT\u2019s business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the product quality specifications of the products that it stores or transports. Changes in these regulations could impose costs on IMTT that would adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations. Petroleum and other products that IMTT stores and transports are sold by customers for consumption into the public market. Various federal, state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe specific product quality specifications for commodities sold into the public market. Changes in product quality specifications or blending requirements could reduce IMTT\u2019s revenue, require IMTT to incur additional costs or require capital expenditures. If IMTT is unable to recover these costs through increased revenue, its cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIMTT\u2019s business could be adversely affected by the insolvency of large customers. IMTT has a number of customers that together generate a material proportion of IMTT\u2019s revenue and gross profit. In 2015, IMTT\u2019s ten largest customers by revenue generated approximately 50% of IMTT revenue. The insolvency of any of these large customers could result in an increase in unutilized storage capacity in the absence of such capacity being rented to other customers and adversely affect IMTT\u2019s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us.\nRisks Related to Atlantic Aviation Deterioration in the economy in general or in the aviation industry that results in less air traffic at airports that Atlantic Aviation services would have a material adverse impact on our business. A large part of the business\u2019 revenue is derived from fueling and other services provided to GA customers and, to a lesser extent, commercial air travelers. An economic downturn could reduce the level of air travel, adversely affecting Atlantic Aviation. GA travel is primarily a function of economic activity. Consequently, during periods of financial market dislocation, FBO customers may be more likely to curtail air travel.\nAir travel and air traffic volume can also be affected by events that have nationwide and industry-wide implications. Events such as wars, outbreaks of disease, severe weather and terrorist activities in the United States or overseas may reduce air travel. Local circumstances include downturns in the general economic conditions of the area where an airport is located or other situations in which the business\u2019 major FBO customers relocate their home base or preferred fueling stop to alternative locations.\nIn addition, changes to regulations governing the tax treatment relating to GA travel, either for businesses or individuals, may cause a reduction in GA travel. Increased environmental regulation restricting or increasing the cost of aviation activities could also cause the business\u2019 revenue to decline.\nA decline in financial markets activity could have a negative impact on Atlantic Aviation\u2019s results of operations. Atlantic Aviation may experience negative impacts to its results of operations due to a deterioration in the level of domestic and international financial markets activity. A deterioration in either equity or credit markets and its resultant impact on volume or value of debt or equity issuances and/or merger and acquisition activity may cause GA activity to decline and consequently impact our results of operations.\nAtlantic Aviation is subject to a variety of competitive pressures, and the actions of competitors may have a material adverse effect on its revenue, market share, and fuel margins, causing a decline in the profitability of that business. FBO operators at a particular airport compete based on a number of factors, including location of the facility relative to runways and street access, service, value added features, reliability and price. Many of Atlantic Aviation\u2019s FBOs compete with one or more FBOs at their respective airports and with FBOs at nearby airports. Furthermore, leases related to FBO operations may be subject to competitive bidding at the end of their term. Some present and potential competitors may have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than Atlantic Aviation, which may negatively impact Atlantic Aviation\u2019s ability to compete at each airport or for lease renewal. Some competitors may aggressively or irrationally price their bids for airport concessions, which may limit the business\u2019 ability to grow or renew its portfolio. Excessive price discounting may cause fuel volume and market share decline, potential decline in hangar rentals and de-icing and may result in increased margin pressure, adversely affecting the profitability of this business.\nAtlantic Aviation\u2019s FBOs do not have the right to be the sole provider of FBO services at any airport. The authority responsible for each airport has the ability to grant other leases to other operators and new competitors could be established at those airports. The addition of new competitors may reduce or impair Atlantic Aviation\u2019s ability to grow or improve its financial performance.\nThe previously announced transaction between Signature Flight Support and Landmark Aviation closed in February 2016. Accordingly, Signature Flight Support has a network of FBOs materially larger than Atlantic Aviation\u2019s and materially larger than has ever existed in the industry. This may enhance Signature Flight Support\u2019s competitive position in the industry and adversely affect Atlantic Aviation\u2019s results of operations.\nAirport leases may not be renewed on economically favorable terms. Atlantic Aviation generates revenue pursuant to concessions granted by airport authorities. Airport authorities may choose at the expiration of the current concession to not renew the concession at all or to only renew the concession on terms which are economically unfavorable to Atlantic Aviation. The loss or modification of any of Atlantic Aviation\u2019s airport leases could adversely impact its results of operations.\nThe termination for cause or convenience of one or more of the FBO leases would damage Atlantic Aviation\u2019s operations significantly. Atlantic Aviation\u2019s revenue is derived from long-term leases on 69 airports in the U.S. If Atlantic Aviation defaults on the terms and conditions of its leases, including upon insolvency, the relevant authority may terminate the lease without compensation. In this case, Atlantic Aviation would then lose the income from that location and potentially the expected returns from prior capital expenditures. Atlantic Aviation would also likely be in default under its loan agreements and be obliged to repay its lenders a portion or the entire outstanding loan amount. Any such events would have a material adverse effect on Atlantic Aviation\u2019s results of operations.\nThe business may be exposed to sudden and extreme volatility in commodity prices directly or indirectly. Aviation fuel is generally stored on site in fuel farms. In some instances these fuel farms are owned by the FBO operator and in other instances they are owned by a third party, usually the airport or a third party fuel provider. Extreme and sudden movements in underlying commodity prices may impact the value of an\nFBO operator\u2019s fuel inventory as well as the margin the FBO operator earns on fuel. In addition, extreme and sudden movements in commodity prices may impact overall GA activity levels.\nFailure to complete, or realize anticipated performance from acquisitions, expansions or developments could negatively impact Atlantic Aviation; the business\u2019 increased indebtedness to fund such acquisitions, expansions or developments could reduce our operating flexibility. Completing acquisitions, expansions or developments are subject to a number of conditions, and we may not complete such transactions on a timely basis or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our Atlantic Aviation business.\nFBO industry participants are often smaller, private companies with less sophisticated information systems and financial reporting and control capabilities. Acquisitions are typically privately owned and have financial reporting and control systems that are less sophisticated than ours. If we complete the acquisitions, we may be unable to integrate the assets into our existing operations on a timely basis or to achieve expected efficiencies. The integration could be expensive and could be time consuming for our management.\nWe may not be able to achieve anticipated levels of financial performance at the acquired assets within our expected time frames or at all. Atlantic Aviation may incur additional indebtedness to fund future acquisitions, expansions or developments. This increased level of indebtedness will increase interest expense and could reduce funds available for reinvestment or distribution to us.\nDeterioration of business jet traffic at airports where Atlantic Aviation operates would decrease Atlantic Aviation\u2019s ability to refinance or service its debt. As of December 31, 2015, Atlantic Aviation had total long-term debt outstanding of $604.6 million, consisting of $600.5 million in term loan debt and $4.1 million in stand-alone debt facilities. The terms of these debt arrangements require compliance with certain operating and financial covenants. The ability of Atlantic Aviation to meet its respective debt service obligations and to refinance or repay their outstanding indebtedness will depend primarily upon cash produced by this business.\nReductions in U.S. military spending could result in a reduction in demand for services provided by Atlantic Aviation at certain airports in the U.S. The U.S. military operates non-combat aircraft that are serviced at Atlantic Aviation FBOs around the U.S. and combat and non-combat aircraft that are serviced at certain airports where specific fuel and fuel-related services are provided by Atlantic Aviation. Cuts in U.S. military spending, to the extent they result in a reduction in the number of flights by military aircraft, could reduce revenue at Atlantic Aviation.\nAtlantic Aviation is subject to extensive governmental regulations that could require significant expenditures. Regulators, such as The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), have and may continue to consider new regulations which could impair the relative convenience of GA and adversely affect demand for Atlantic Aviation\u2019s services. FBOs are subject to extensive regulatory requirements that could result in significant costs. For example, the FAA, from time to time, issues directives and other regulations relating to the management, maintenance and operation of facilities. Compliance with those requirements may cause Atlantic Aviation to incur significant expenditures. The proposal and enactment of additional laws and regulations, as well as any charges that Atlantic Aviation has not complied with any such laws and regulations, could significantly increase the cost of Atlantic Aviation\u2019s operations and reduce overall revenue. In addition, new regulations, if implemented, could decrease the convenience and attractiveness of GA travel relative to commercial air travel and, therefore, may adversely impact demand for Atlantic Aviation\u2019s services.\nThe lack of accurate and reliable industry data can result in unfavorable strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions and macro pricing decisions. The business uses industry and airport-specific GA traffic data published by the FAA to identify trends in the FBO industry. The business also uses this traffic data as a key input to decision-making in strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions and macro pricing matters. However, as noted by the FAA on their\nwebsite, the data has several limitations and challenges. As a result, the use of the FAA traffic data may result in conclusions in strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions or macro pricing decisions that are ultimately sub-optimal.\nRisks Related to CP&E Development and investment in the power industry involve various development, construction, operational, and regulatory risks that could materially adversely affect our financial results. The development, construction, operation and maintenance of power generation facilities involve various operational risks, which can include mechanical and structural failure, accidents, labor issues or the failure of technology to perform as anticipated. Events outside our control, such as economic developments, changes in fuel prices or the price of other feedstocks, governmental policy changes, demand for energy and the like, could materially reduce the revenues generated or increase the expenses of constructing, operating, maintaining or restoring power generation businesses. Degradation of the performance of our facilities may reduce our revenues. Unanticipated capital expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading or repairing our facilities may reduce profitability. We may also choose or be required to decommission a power generation facility or other asset. The decommissioning process could be protracted and result in the incurrence of significant financial and/or regulatory obligations or other uncertainties.\nOur CP&E businesses may also face construction risks typical for power generation and related infrastructure businesses, including, without limitation:\n\u2022 labor disputes, work stoppages or shortages of skilled labor;\n\u2022 shortages of fuels or materials;\n\u2022 slower than projected construction progress and the unavailability or late delivery of necessary equipment;\n\u2022 delays caused by or in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or permits;\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions and unexpected construction conditions;\n\u2022 accidents or the breakdown or failure of construction equipment or processes;\n\u2022 difficulties in obtaining suitable or sufficient financing; and\n\u2022 force majeure or catastrophic events such as explosions, fires and terrorist activities and other similar events beyond our control.\nSuch developments could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, and could prevent completion of construction activities once undertaken. Construction costs may exceed estimates for various reasons, including inaccurate engineering and planning, labor and building material costs in excess of expectations and unanticipated problems with project start-up. Such unexpected increases may result in increased debt service costs and funds being insufficient to complete construction. Our facilities under development may receive little or no cash flow through the date of completion of development and may experience operating deficits after the date of completion. In addition, market conditions may change during the course of development that make such development less attractive than at the time it was commenced. Any events of this nature could severely delay or prevent the completion of, or significantly increase the cost of, the construction. In addition, there are risks inherent in the construction work which may give rise to claims or demands against us from time to time. Delays in the completion of any power project may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher O&M costs.\nInvestments in electric power industries continue to experience increasing competitive pressures, primarily in wholesale markets, as a result of consumer demands, technological advances, greater availability of natural gas and other factors. Changes in regulation may support not only consolidation among domestic utilities and other power producers, but also the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities into separate generation, transmission and distribution businesses. As a result, additional significant competitors could become active in the independent power industry.\nOur CP&E businesses are subject to substantial regulations that impact operations and could result in additional costs. The power and energy sectors are the subject of substantial and complex laws, rules and regulations. These regulators include the FERC, which has jurisdiction over the transmission and wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce and over the transportation, storage and certain sales of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the rates, charges and other terms and conditions for such services, respectively and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the purpose of which is to establish and enforce reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and operators of the bulk power system. These regulators derive their authority from, among other laws, the Federal Power Act, as amended (FPA), The Energy Policy Act of 2005, Natural Gas Act, as amended (NGA) and state and, perhaps, local public utility laws.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and contractors when developing our power projects. The failure of those third parties to perform could adversely affect our results of operations. We source engines, boilers, chillers, cogeneration systems, photovoltaic modules and other complex components from a wide selection of third-party suppliers and engage third-party contractors for the construction of power projects. We typically enter into contracts with our suppliers and contractors on a project-by-project basis and do not maintain long-term contracts with our suppliers or contractors. Therefore, we are generally exposed to price fluctuations and availability of products and components sourced from our suppliers and construction services procured from our contractors. In light of changing market dynamics and government policies, the price and availability of certain products have been subject to significant volatility in recent years. Increases in the prices of products and components, decreases in their availability, fluctuations in construction, labor and installation costs, or changes in the terms of our relationships with our suppliers and contractors may increase the cost of procuring equipment and engaging contractors and hence materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the delivery of defective products or products or construction services by our suppliers or contractors which are otherwise not in compliance with contract specifications, or the late supply of products or construction services, may cause construction delays or power projects that fail to adhere to our quality and safety standards, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWarranties provided by our suppliers and contractors may be limited or insufficient to compensate our losses, or may not cover the nature of our losses incurred. We expect to benefit from various warranties, including product quality and performance warranties, provided by our supplies and contractors. These suppliers and contractors, however, may file for bankruptcy, cease operations or otherwise become unable or unwilling to fulfill their warranty obligations. Even if a supplier fulfills its warranty obligations, the warranty may not be sufficient to compensate us for all of our losses. In addition, the warranty period generally expires several years after the date that the equipment is delivered or commissioned and is subject to liability limits. Where damages are caused by defective products provided by our suppliers or construction services delivered by our contractors, our suppliers or contractors may be unable or unwilling to perform their warranty obligations as a result of their financial condition or otherwise, or if the warranty period has expired or a liability limit has been reached, there may be a reduction or loss of warranty protection for the affected projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our generating capacity and the associated attributes of our facilities are not contracted and the price at which we can sell electricity may be impacted by price fluctuations in the wholesale power and energy markets. Market prices for electricity, capacity and ancillary services are unpredictable and may fluctuate substantially. Unlike most other commodities, power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power prices are subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and spot markets. CP&E\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be impacted by lower prices for wholesale power.\nCP&E depends on electric interconnection and transmission facilities that we do not own or control and that are potentially subject to transmission constraints. If these facilities fail to provide adequate transmission capacity, CP&E may be restricted in its ability to deliver electricity to customers. CP&E depends on electric interconnection and transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the power it generates. Certain off-taker contracts include limited provisions that allow for occasional curtailment of electricity generated by CP&E due to the limitations of the transmission system or electricity grid. Any constraints on, or the failure of, interconnections or transmission facilities could prevent CP&E from selling power and could adversely affect CP&E\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCP&E depends on counterparties performing in accordance with their agreements. If they fail to so perform, our CP&E businesses could incur substantial losses of revenue or additional expenses and business disruptions. Counterparties to long-term agreements within CP&E may not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements. Should they fail to perform, CP&E may be required to seek alternative purchasers of the power produced. The failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could adversely affect CP&E\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCP&E\u2019s BEC facility depends on a single dedicated electric transmission facility which we own and operate. If there were to be a failure of this transmission cable, CP&E\u2019s BEC facility may be restricted in its ability to deliver electricity to customers. CP&E\u2019s BEC facility depends on a subsea electricity transmission cable which runs under NYH from the project site to Brooklyn, New York. While the cables are buried under the riverbed, an accident or other failure of one or more of these cables could cause BEC to be unable to deliver electricity for a significant period of time. In addition, BEC\u2019s facility expansion will result in greater utilization of the subsea cables. While the cables are rated to safely transmit additional power, BEC has not historically operated at this capacity. Any meaningful disruption in the cable\u2019s performance could adversely affect CP&E\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fuel price volatility and interruptions in supplies and our failure to have adequate contingencies in place could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For certain of CP&E\u2019s current and future generating facilities, including BEC, we may be responsible for the purchase of fuel and face the risks of supply interruptions and fuel price volatility, as fuel deliveries may not exactly match those required for energy sales. CP&E\u2019s fuel supply arrangements must be coordinated with transportation agreements, storage services, financial hedging transactions and other contracts so that the fuel is delivered to our facilities at the times, in the quantities and otherwise in a manner that meets CP&E\u2019s needs. In addition, CP&E faces risks with regard to the delivery to and the use of fuel including the following:\n\u2022 transportation may be unavailable if pipeline infrastructure is damaged or disabled;\n\u2022 pipeline tariff changes may adversely affect our ability to, or cost to, deliver fuel supply;\n\u2022 third-party suppliers may default on supply obligations, and we may be unable to replace supplies currently under contract;\n\u2022 market liquidity for fuel or availability of storage services may be insufficient or available only at unfavorable prices; and\n\u2022 fuel quality variation may adversely affect our operations.\nThe generation of electricity from our solar and wind power facilities is dependent on meteorological conditions. If conditions are unfavorable, CP&E\u2019s facilities may underperform which could materially adversely affect CP&E\u2019s financial condition, cash flows and result of operations. CP&E\u2019s solar and wind power facilities are dependent on the available solar and wind resources. Historical solar insolation and wind speed data, combined with computer modeling, is used to project expected\npower generation. Actual conditions are beyond our control and may vary substantially from our projections. If actual conditions cause material underperformance, CP&E\u2019s result of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. This may cause a default under some or all of CP&E\u2019s debt facilities and/or limit CP&E\u2019s ability to pay distributions to MIC.\nWe may not be able to replace expiring PPAs or tolling agreements with contracts on similar terms. If we are unable to replace an expired contract with an acceptable new contract, we will experience lower than anticipated revenues. We may not be able to replace an expiring PPA or tolling arrangement with a contract on equivalent terms and conditions, including at prices that permit operation of the related facility on a profitable basis. If we are unable to replace an expiring contract, the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations. In the case of a facility that ceases operations, the PPA may require that we remove the assets, including fixing or reimbursing the site owner for any damages caused by the assets or the removal of such assets. Alternatively, we may agree to sell the assets to the site owner, but we can offer no assurances as to the terms and conditions, including price, that we would receive in any sale, and the sale price may not be sufficient to replace the revenue previously generated by the project.\nCP&E\u2019s failure to uphold its obligations as managing member at the relevant facilities could materially adversely affect CP&E\u2019s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. As managing member, CP&E is obligated to perform certain actions, including providing certain reporting items to its co-investor and the filing of correct and timely tax returns. As managing member, CP&E is also obligated to refrain from performing certain actions, including selling its interest to certain entities that would result in adverse economic outcomes to CP&E and its co-investor due to tax regulations. If CP&E were to cause an adverse tax outcome for its co-investor, CP&E could be liable. CP&E\u2019s failure to perform its obligations or to take any actions contrary to its obligations under any or all operating LLC agreements could adversely affect CP&E\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nLaws, governmental regulations and policies supporting renewable energy, and specifically solar and wind energy (including tax incentives), could change at any time, including as a result of new political leadership, and such changes may materially adversely affect our business and our growth strategy. Renewable assets currently benefit from various federal, state and local governmental incentives. In the United States, these incentives include investment tax credits (ITC) or cash grants in lieu of ITCs, loan guarantees, RPS programs, modified accelerated cost-recovery system of depreciation and bonus depreciation. In addition, many U.S. states have adopted RPS programs mandating that a specified percentage of electricity sales come from eligible sources of renewable energy. If these government incentives or RPS requirements are reduced or eliminated, it could lead to fewer future power contracts or lead to lower prices for the sale of power in future power contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on future projects.\nCP&E is subject to environmental laws that impose extensive and increasingly stringent requirements on CP&E\u2019s ongoing operations, as well as potentially substantial liabilities arising out of environmental contamination. In addition, certain of CP&E\u2019s current and future facilities may be subject to operating restrictions and limitations by a variety of regulatory bodies. CP&E is subject to the environmental laws of U.S., federal, state and local authorities. CP&E must comply with numerous environmental laws and obtain numerous governmental permits and approvals to build and operate CP&E\u2019s plants. Should CP&E fail to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to its operations, CP&E could be subject to administrative, civil and/or criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take other actions seeking to curtail operations. In addition, conventional power facilities, such as BEC, are subject to federal, state and local regulations which require certain permits to be obtained for their operations. Certain of these permits may restrict CP&E\u2019s power facilities from operating under certain conditions or for more than a set number of hours per year. These regulatory limitations could adversely affect CP&E\u2019s cash flow, results of operations or competitive position.\nPolicies at the national, regional and state levels to regulate Greenhouse Gas emissions, as well as climate change, could adversely impact CP&E\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Hazards customary to the power production industry include the potential for unusual weather conditions, which could affect fuel pricing and availability, as well as route to market or access to customers through transmission and distribution lines or to critical plant assets. To the extent that climate change contributes to the frequency or intensity of weather-related events, CP&E\u2019s operations could be affected.\nCP&E operates generating units in New Jersey that are not subject to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which is a regional cap and trade system. Future state-level legislative changes may result in generating units in New Jersey being subject to RGGI. These new rules could adversely impact CP&E\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCP&E competes with both conventional power industries and renewable power industries, which could limit our returns and materially adversely affect our financial condition. The power industry faces intense competition from both conventional and renewable energy providers. Other energy sources may benefit from innovations that reduce costs, increase safety or otherwise improve their competitiveness. New natural resources may be discovered, or global economic, business or political developments may disproportionately benefit certain energy sources.\nOther companies with which CP&E competes may have greater liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial resources, lower cost structures, more effective risk management policies and procedures, greater ability to incur losses, longer-standing relationships with customers, greater potential for profitability from ancillary services or greater flexibility in the timing of their sale of generation capacity and ancillary services than CP&E does.\nCP&E\u2019s competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their power generation facilities than CP&E can. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among current and new competitors and rapidly gain significant market share. There can be no assurance that CP&E will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on CP&E\u2019s results of operations.\nRisks Related to Hawaii Gas Hawaii Gas is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices that have a history of price volatility. To the extent that these costs cannot be passed on to customers, both in the short-term or the long-term, the business\u2019 gross profit and cash flows will be adversely affected. The profitability of Hawaii Gas is based on the margin of sales prices over costs. Since LPG and feedstock for the SNG plant are commodities, changes in global supply of and demand for these products can have a significant impact on costs. Hawaii Gas has no control over these costs, and, to the extent that these costs cannot be hedged or passed on to customers, the business\u2019 financial condition and the results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe operations of Hawaii Gas are subject to a variety of competitive pressures and the actions of competitors, particularly those involved in other energy sources, could have a materially adverse effect on operating results. Other fuel sources such as electricity, diesel, solar energy, geo-thermal, wind, other gas providers and alternative energy sources may be substituted for certain gas end-use applications, particularly if the price of gas increases relative to other fuel sources, whether due to higher costs or otherwise. Customers could, for a number of reasons, including increased gas prices, lower costs of alternative energy or convenience, meet their energy needs through alternative sources. This could have an adverse effect on the business\u2019 revenues and cash flows.\nHawaii Gas relies on its SNG plant, including its transmission pipeline, for a significant portion of its sales. Disruptions at that facility could adversely affect the business\u2019 ability to serve customers. Disruptions at the SNG plant resulting from mechanical or operational problems or power failures could affect the ability of Hawaii Gas to produce SNG. Most of the utility sales on Oahu are of SNG and all SNG is produced at the Oahu plant. Disruptions to the primary and redundant production systems would have a significant adverse effect on Hawaii Gas\u2019s revenues and cash flows.\nDisruptions or shutdowns at either of the oil refineries on Oahu from which Hawaii Gas obtains both LPG and the primary feedstock for its SNG plant may have an adverse effect on the operations of the business. Hawaii Gas processes SNG and distributes SNG and LPG. SNG feedstock or LPG supply disruptions could increase Hawaii Gas\u2019s costs as a result of an inability to source feedstock at rates comparable to those being paid currently. The extended unavailability of one or both of the refineries or disruption to crude oil supplies or feedstock to Hawaii could also result in an increased reliance on off-island sources. An inability to purchase LPG from off-island sources would adversely affect operations. The business is also limited in its ability to store LPG, and any disruption in supply may cause a depletion of LPG stocks. All supply disruptions of SNG or LPG, if occurring for an extended period, could adversely impact the business\u2019s contribution margin and cash flows.\nHawaii Gas is subject to risks associated with volatility in the Hawaii economy. Hawaii\u2019s economy, and demand for Hawaii Gas\u2019s products, is heavily influenced by economic conditions in the U.S. and Asia and their impact on tourism, as well as by government spending. If the local economy deteriorates, the volume of gas sold could be negatively affected by business closures or lower usage, either of which could adversely impact the business\u2019 financial performance. Additionally, a lack of growth in the Hawaiian economy could reduce the level of new residential construction, and adversely impact growth in volume from new residential customers. A reduction in government activity, particularly military activity could also have a negative impact on Hawaii Gas\u2019s results.\nChanges in commodity market prices may have a negative effect on our liquidity. Depending on the terms of our contracts with suppliers as well as the extent and success of our use of financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to volatility in the cost of LPG, changes in the market price of LPG could create payment obligations and expose the business to increased liquidity risk.\nHawaii Gas\u2019s utility business is subject to regulation by the HPUC and actions by the HPUC or changes to the regulatory environment may constrain the operation or profitability of the business. The HPUC regulates all franchised or certificated public service companies operating in Hawaii; prescribes rates, tariffs, charges and fees; determines the allowable rate of earnings in establishing rates; issues guidelines concerning the general management of franchised or certificated utility businesses; and acts on requests for the acquisition, sale, disposition or other exchange of utility properties, including mergers and consolidations.\nAny adverse decision by the HPUC concerning the level or method of determining utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in the rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of our acquisition, the business agreed to 14 regulatory conditions with the HPUC that address a variety of matters including: a requirement that Hawaii Gas and HGC\u2019s ratio of consolidated debt to total capital does not exceed 65%; and a requirement to maintain $20.0 million in readily-available cash resources at Hawaii Gas, HGC or MIC. The business is currently in compliance with these conditions, however, future non-compliance with these or other HPUC regulatory conditions, could adversely impact the profitability of Hawaii Gas.\nThe proposed merger of Hawaii Electric Industries and NextEra Energy could create delays in the review of Hawaii Gas\u2019s pending and future regulatory filings or result in a less favorable competitive landscape. The proposed merger, announced in December 2014, contemplates the largest energy transaction in state history and its review will require a significant portion of Hawaii\u2019s regulatory resources. In March 2015, the HPUC issued an order granting Hawaii Gas intervener status in the merger docket. As of December 31, 2015 the evidentiary hearings were in recess and scheduled to resume in early 2016, with additional briefs from the parties expected thereafter with no deadline for a final HPUC ruling. To the extent this delays the timely review of current or future Hawaii Gas regulatory filings, this may have an adverse impact on the business\u2019 revenues and cash flows. Further, to the extent that the merged companies are permitted to further vertically integrate into fuel supply, this could also result in an adverse impact on the business\u2019 revenues and cash flows.\nThe RNG and LNG initiatives expose Hawaii Gas to new supply, counterparty, facility, technology and regulatory risks. Hawaii Gas continues to evaluate a range of RNG sources for conversion into pipeline quality gas in scale quantities. These initiatives include ongoing commercial negotiations to source biogas from waste water treatment plants, landfills and biomass. The source gas for these projects is often controlled, directly or indirectly, by state or municipal government, thereby requiring extended procurement processes which may delay the business\u2019s plans for implementation. Hawaii Gas must report annually to the HPUC the percentage of feedstock and quantity of gas produced from non-petroleum feedstock. In the event Hawaii Gas\u2019s RNG initiatives face procurement delays, regulators could impose a renewable portfolio standard on the business, resulting in significantly increased energy costs to the business and its customers.\nHawaii Gas has invested over $5.0 million to evaluate and plan for LNG transport from the mainland and utilization by the business, as well as to commence training and development of systems required for regulatory approval. This project is subject to ongoing implementation risk including but not limited to: the timely issuance of necessary permits, licenses and approvals by governmental agencies and third parties; unanticipated changes in market demand or supply; competition with similar projects; site difficulties; environmental conditions; delays of critical equipment and materials; and commercial arrangements to transport and distribute LNG. In August 2015, Hawaii Governor David Ige announced that his administration is opposed to LNG for electricity generation. If the project is delayed beyond the estimated implementation period, the actual cost of planning and implementation may increase beyond the amounts currently estimated in our capital and operating budgets. A delay in implementation would also cause a delay in the receipt of projected revenues, which may cause our financial results to be negatively impacted.\nBecause of its geographic location, Hawaii, and in turn Hawaii Gas, is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks that could materially disrupt operations. Hawaii is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks, such as hurricanes, floods, heavy and sustained rains and tidal waves. Because the business\u2019 SNG plant, SNG transmission line and several storage facilities are close to the ocean, weather-related disruptions to operations are possible. In addition, earthquakes may cause disruptions. These events could damage the business\u2019 assets or could result in wide-spread damage to its customers, thereby reducing the volumes of gas sold and, to the extent such damages are not covered by insurance, the business\u2019 revenues and cash flows.\nReductions in U.S. military spending could result in a reduction in demand for gas in Hawaii. The U.S. military has a significant presence in Hawaii. To the extent that federal spending cuts, including voluntary or mandatory cuts in U.S. military spending, result in a reduced military presence in Hawaii, such reductions could reduce the demand for gas in Hawaii.\nBecause of its geographic location and the unique economy of Hawaii, Hawaii Gas is subject to challenges in hiring and maintaining staff with specialized skill sets. The changing nature of the Hawaii energy complex has had an impact on our Company\u2019s staffing requirements. Volatility in feedstock prices, together with the impact of the State of Hawaii\u2019s goals to reduce dependency on imported petroleum, requires staff with specialized knowledge of the energy sector. Because\nthe resident labor pool in Hawaii is both small, and oriented mainly to Hawaii\u2019s basic industries, it is difficult to find individuals with these specialized skill sets. Moreover, relocation to Hawaii is costly and often requires employees to make cultural and family adjustments not normally required for a change of employment. The inability to source and retain staff with appropriate skill sets could adversely impact the performance of our business.\nHawaii Gas\u2019s operations on the islands of Hawaii, Maui and Kauai rely on LPG that is transported to those islands by Jones Act qualified barges from Oahu and from non-Jones Act vessels from off-island ports. Disruptions to service by those vessels could adversely affect the financial performance of our business. The Jones Act requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried in U.S.-flag ships and that they meet certain other requirements. The business has time charter agreements allowing the use of two barges that currently have a cargo capacity of approximately 420,000 gallons and 500,000 gallons of LPG, respectively. The barges used by the business are the only two Jones Act qualified barges available in the Hawaiian Islands capable of carrying large volumes of LPG. If the barges are unable to transport LPG from Oahu and the business is not able to secure off-island sources of LPG or obtain an exemption to the Jones Act that would permit importation of a sufficient quantity of LPG from the mainland U.S., the profitability of the business could be adversely impacted. If the barges require refurbishment or repair at a greater frequency than forecast, cash outflows for capital costs could adversely impact Hawaii Gas\u2019s results and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Having an External Manager We are subject to the terms and conditions of the Management Services Agreement between our Company and our Manager. We cannot unilaterally amend the Management Services Agreement between ourselves and our Manager. Changes in the compensation of our Manager, certain rights held by the Manager or other components of the Agreement require the approval of our Manager and limit our ability to make changes without the consent of the Manager that could be beneficial to shareholders generally.\nOur Manager owns a significant portion of our shares outstanding. A sale of all or a portion of the shares owned by our Manager could be interpreted by the equity markets as a lack of confidence in the prospects of our Company. Our Manager, in its sole discretion, determines whether to reinvest base and performance fees in shares and whether to hold or sell those securities. Reinvestment of base and performance fees in additional shares would increase our Manager\u2019s ownership stake in our Company. As of February 22, 2016, our Manager owned 6.97% of our outstanding shares. If our Manager decides, for reasons other than the performance and prospects of our Company, to reduce its position in our Company, such sales may be interpreted by some market participants as a lack of confidence in our Company and put downward pressure on the market price of our shares. Sales of shares by our Manager could increase the available supply and decrease the price if demand is insufficient to absorb such sales.\nCertain provisions of the Management Services Agreement and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of our Company make it difficult for third parties to acquire control of our Company and could deprive investors of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for their shares. In addition to the limited circumstances in which our Manager can be terminated under the terms of the Management Services Agreement, the Management Services Agreement provides that in circumstances where the stock ceases to be listed on a recognized U.S. exchange as a result of the acquisition of stock by third parties in an amount that results in the stock ceasing to meet the distribution and trading criteria on such exchange or market, our Manager has the option to either propose an alternate fee structure and remain our Manager or resign, terminate the Management Services Agreement upon 30 days\u2019 written notice and be paid a substantial termination fee. The termination fee payable on our Manager\u2019s exercise of its right to resign as our Manager subsequent to a delisting of our shares could delay or prevent a change in control that may favor our\nshareholders. Furthermore, in the event of such a delisting, any proceeds from the sale, lease or exchange of a significant amount of assets must be reinvested in new assets of our Company, subject to debt repayment obligations. We would also be prohibited from incurring any new indebtedness or engaging in any transactions with shareholders of our Company or its affiliates without the prior written approval of our Manager. These provisions could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize a premium on the shares owned by them.\nThe certificate of incorporation and bylaws of our Company contain a number of provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or discouraging a third-party from acquiring, control of our Company. These provisions include:\n\u2022 restrictions on our Company\u2019s ability to enter into certain transactions with our major shareholders, with the exception of our Manager; in addition, our Company is governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law;\n\u2022 allowing only our Company\u2019s Board of Directors to fill vacancies, including newly created directorships and requiring that directors may be removed with or without cause by a shareholder vote of 66 2/3%;\n\u2022 requiring that only our Company\u2019s chairman or Board of Directors may call a special meeting of our shareholders;\n\u2022 prohibiting shareholders from taking any action by written consent;\n\u2022 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Company\u2019s Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our shareholders at a shareholders\u2019 meeting; and\n\u2022 having a substantial number of additional shares authorized but unissued.\nOur Manager\u2019s decision to reinvest its monthly base management fees and quarterly performance fees, as applicable, in shares or retain the cash will affect shareholders differently. Our Manager is paid a management fee based on our Company\u2019s market capitalization and potentially performance fees based on the total return generated on behalf of equity holders relative to a utilities-based benchmark. Our Manager, in its sole discretion, may elect to retain base management fees and performance fees, if applicable, paid in cash or to reinvest such payments in additional shares. In the event our Manager chooses not to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional shares, the amount paid will reduce the cash that may otherwise be distributed as a dividend to all shareholders or used in our Company\u2019s operations. In the event our Manager chooses to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional shares, effectively returning the cash to us, such reinvestment and the issuance of new shares will dilute existing shareholders by the increase in the percentage of shares owned by our Manager. Either option may adversely impact the market for our shares.\nIn addition, our Manager has typically elected to invest its fees in shares, and, unless otherwise agreed with MIC, can only change this election during a 20-trading day window following our Company\u2019s earnings release. Any change would apply to fees paid thereafter. Accordingly, shareholders would generally have notice of our Manager\u2019s intent to receive fees in cash rather than reinvest before the change was effective.\nOur Manager can resign with 90 days notice, or our CEO or CFO could be removed by our Manager, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations, which could adversely affect our financial results and negatively impact the market price of our shares. Our Manager has the right, under the Management Services Agreement, to resign at any time with 90 days notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. The resignation of our Manager will trigger mandatory repayment obligations under debt facilities at certain of our operating companies. In addition, our Manager could re-assign or remove the CEO and/or the CFO from their positions and responsibilities at our Company without the Board\u2019s approval and with little or no notice. If our Manager resigns or our CEO/CFO are removed, we may not be able to find a new external manager or hire internal management with similar expertise within 90 days to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are\nunable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial results could be adversely affected, perhaps materially, and the market price of our shares may decline substantially. In addition, the coordination of our internal management, acquisition activities and supervision of our businesses are likely to suffer if we were unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our Manager and its affiliates.\nFurthermore, if our Manager resigns, our Company and its subsidiaries will be required to cease use of the Macquarie brand entirely, and change their names to remove any reference to \u201cMacquarie\u201d. This may cause the value of our Company and the market price of our shares to decline.\nOur externally managed model may not be viewed favorably by investors. Our Company is externally managed by a member of the Macquarie Group. Our Manager receives a fee for its services that provides for a number of corporate center functions including the compensation of our management team and those who provide services to our Company on a shared basis, health and welfare benefits, the provision of facilities, technology and insurance (other than Directors and Officers). The fee is based on the market capitalization of our Company and thus increases as our Company grows. The size of the fee may bear no direct correlation with the actual cost of providing the agreed upon services and may be higher than the cost of managing our Company internally. Per the terms of the Management Services Agreement with our Manager, the default manner for satisfying any base or performance fees to which our Manager may be entitled is the issuance of additional shares. To the extent the fee continues to be satisfied with the delivery of additional shares, all shareholders are diluted and our hurdle for growing distributable cash on a per share basis will be higher.\nOur Manager\u2019s affiliation with Macquarie Group Limited and the Macquarie Group may result in conflicts of interest or a decline in our stock price. Our Manager is an affiliate of Macquarie Group Limited and a member of the Macquarie Group. From time to time, we have entered into, and in the future we may enter into, transactions and relationships involving Macquarie Group Limited, its affiliates, or other members of the Macquarie Group. Such transactions have included and may include, among other things, the entry into debt facilities and derivative instruments with members of the Macquarie Group serving as lender or counterparty, and financial advisory or equity underwriting services provided to us by the Macquarie Group.\nAlthough our audit committee, all of the members of which are independent directors, is required to approve of any related party transactions, including those involving members of the Macquarie Group or its affiliates, the relationship of our Manager to the Macquarie Group may result in conflicts of interest.\nIn addition, as a result of our Manager\u2019s being a member of the Macquarie Group, negative market perceptions of Macquarie Group Limited generally or of Macquarie\u2019s infrastructure management model, or Macquarie Group statements or actions with respect to other managed vehicles, may affect market perceptions of our Company and cause a decline in the price of our shares unrelated to our financial performance and prospects.\nIn the event of the underperformance of our Manager, we may be unable to remove our Manager, which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could adversely affect the market price of our shares. Under the terms of the Management Services Agreement, our Manager must significantly underperform in order for the Management Services Agreement to be terminated. Our Company\u2019s Board of Directors cannot remove our Manager unless:\n\u2022 our shares underperform a weighted average of two benchmark indices by more than 30% in relative terms and more than 2.5% in absolute terms in 16 out of 20 consecutive quarters prior to and including the most recent full quarter, and the holders of a minimum of 66.67% of the outstanding shares (excluding any shares owned by our Manager or any affiliate of the Manager) vote to remove our Manager;\n\u2022 our Manager materially breaches the terms of the Management Services Agreement and such breach has been unremedied within 60 days after notice;\n\u2022 our Manager acts with gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of its duties in carrying out its obligations under the Management Services Agreement, or engages in fraudulent or dishonest acts; or\n\u2022 our Manager experiences certain bankruptcy events.\nOur Company\u2019s Board of Directors cannot remove our Manager unless the market performance of our shares also significantly underperforms the benchmark index. If we were unable to remove our Manager in circumstances where the absolute market performance of our shares does not meet expectations, the market price of our shares could be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock The performances of our businesses or our holding company structure may limit our ability to make regular dividends in the future to our shareholders because we are reliant upon the cash flows and distributions from our businesses. Our Company is a holding company with no operations. Therefore, we are dependent upon the ability of our businesses to make distributions to our Company to enable it to meet its expenses, and to make dividends to shareholders in the future. The ability of our operating subsidiaries and the businesses in which we invest to make distributions to our Company is subject to limitations based on their operating performance, the terms of their debt agreements, the applicable laws of their respective jurisdictions, and compliance of co-investors with applicable contracts and agreements. In addition, the ability of each business to reduce its outstanding debt will be similarly limited by its operating performance, as discussed below and in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.\nThe market price and marketability of our shares may from time to time be significantly affected by numerous factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings. The market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly. Many factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price and marketability of our shares and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through equity financings. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of Macquarie Group Limited and/or vehicles managed by the Macquarie Group or branded under the Macquarie name or logo;\n\u2022 significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered investment companies, business development companies or companies in our sectors, which may not be related to the operating performance of these companies;\n\u2022 changes in our earnings or variations in operating results;\n\u2022 changes in our ratings from any of the ratings agencies;\n\u2022 any shortfall in EBITDA excluding non-cash items or Free Cash Flow from levels expected by securities analysts;\n\u2022 changes in regulatory policies or tax law;\n\u2022 operating performance of companies comparable to us;\n\u2022 loss of funding sources; and\n\u2022 substantial sales by our Manager or other significant shareholders.\nWe may issue preferred stock with rights, preferences and privileges that may be superior to the common stock, and these could have negative consequences for holders of our common stock. We may issue shares of preferred stock in one or more financing transactions. We may also use the authorized preferred stock for funding transactions, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, business combinations and investments, although we have no\nimmediate plans to do so. We cannot provide assurances that any such transaction will be consummated on favorable terms or at all, that they will enhance shareholder value, or that they will not adversely affect our business or the trading price of our common stock. Any shares of preferred stock could be issued with rights, preferences and privileges that may be superior to those of our common stock. In addition, preferred stock could be issued for capital raising, financing and acquisition needs or opportunities that have the effect of making an acquisition of our Company more difficult or costly, as could also be the case if the board of directors were to issue additional common stock.\nOur reported Earnings per Share (EPS), as defined under GAAP, does not reflect the cash generated by our businesses and may result in unfavorable comparisons with other businesses for which EPS is a useful component in valuation. Our businesses own and invest in high-value, long-lived assets that generate large amounts of depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that serve to reduce reported EPS. We pay our Manager base and may pay performance fees both of which may be reinvested in additional shares thereby rendering them a non-cash expense. Whether the fees are settled in cash or reinvested in additional shares, they have the effect of reducing EPS. As a result, our financial performance may appear to be substantially worse compared with businesses whose earnings do not reflect the effects of depreciation and amortization (or other non-cash items). To the extent that our results appear to be worse, we may have relatively greater difficulty attracting investors in our stock.\nOur inability, under GAAP, to consolidate the financial results of certain of our investments may make it relatively more difficult to analyze the cash generating capacity of our combined businesses. We may make investments in certain businesses which we will be required to account for using the equity method rather than consolidate with the results of our other businesses. The equity method requires us to include the portion of the net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP, equal to our equity interest in the business in our consolidated statement of operations. The physical asset backed nature of the businesses in which we invest (and the higher levels of non-cash expenses including depreciation and amortization) may mean that the performance of these investments have relatively little impact on our consolidated statement of operations even where they generate positive cash flow and this cash flow may not be reflected in the valuation of our shares.\nOur total assets include a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. The write-off of a significant portion of intangible assets would negatively affect our reported earnings. Our total assets reflect a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. At December 31, 2015, goodwill and other intangible assets, net, represented approximately 40.0% of our total assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were primarily recognized as a result of the acquisitions of our businesses. Other intangible assets consist primarily of airport operating rights, customer relationships and trade names. On at least an annual basis we assess whether there has been any impairment in the value of goodwill and assess for impairment of other intangible assets when there are triggering events or circumstances. If the carrying value of the tested asset exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is deemed to have occurred. In this event, the intangible is written down to fair value. Under current accounting rules, this would result in a charge to reported earnings. We have recognized significant impairments in the past, and any future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our reported earnings and total capitalization, and could be material.\nOur total assets include a substantial amount of intangible assets and fixed assets. The depreciation and amortization of these assets may negatively impact our reported earnings. The high level of intangible and physical assets written up to fair value upon acquisition of our businesses generates substantial amounts of depreciation and amortization. These non-cash items serve to lower net income as reported in our consolidated statement of operations as well as our taxable income. The generation of net losses or relatively small net income may contribute to a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward that can be used to offset current taxable income in future periods. However, the continued reporting of little or negative net income may adversely affect the attractiveness of our Company among some potential investors and may reduce the market for our shares.\nRisks Related to Taxation We have significant NOL carryforwards that may be fully utilized over the next several years thereby subjecting us to payment of substantial federal income taxes and reducing our distributable Free Cash Flow. We may, without the acquisition of businesses with NOLs, incurring performance fees or implementation of other strategies that provide us with additional tax shield, fully utilize our existing NOLs before we anticipate or have previously indicated. At that point we may be subject to federal income taxes in consolidation and any liability could be material. Any liability will reduce distributable Free Cash Flow and could prevent the growth or reduce the rate of growth of our dividends.\nThe current treatment of qualified dividend income and long-term capital gains under current U.S. federal income tax law may be adversely affected, changed or repealed in the future. Under current law, qualified dividend income and long-term capital gains are taxed to non-corporate investors at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. In addition, certain holders that are individuals, estates or trusts are subject to 3.8% surtax on all or a portion of their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which may include all or a portion of their dividend income and net gains from the disposition of our shares. This tax treatment may be adversely affected, changed or repealed by future changes in tax laws at any time, which may affect market perceptions of our Company and the market price of our shares could be negatively affected.\nOur ability to use our NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation, such as the Company) that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income. Generally speaking, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if the aggregate percentage ownership of the stock of the corporation held by one or more \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) increases by more than fifty percentage points over such shareholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, which is generally the three year-period ending on the transaction date. If we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs and certain other tax attributes could be limited.\nWe have significant income tax NOLs, which may not be realized before they expire. We have $426.2 million in federal NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2015. While we have concluded that all of the NOLs will more likely than not be realized, there can be no assurance that we will utilize the NOLs generated to date or any NOLs we might generate in the future. In addition, we have incurred state NOLs and have provided a valuation allowance against a portion of those. As with our federal NOLs, there is also no assurance that we will utilize those state losses or future losses that may be generated. Further, the State of Louisiana has limited the use of NOL carryforwards for 2015, 2016 and 2017. There can be no assurance that other states will not suspend the use of NOL carryforwards or that Louisiana will not extend its limitations.\nThe treatment of depreciation and other tax deductions under current U.S. federal income tax law may be adversely affected, changed or repealed in the future. Under current law, certain capital expenditures are eligible for accelerated depreciation, including 50% bonus depreciation for assets placed in service prior to December 31, 2017, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, certain other expenses are eligible to be deducted for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This tax treatment may be adversely affected, changed or repealed by future changes in tax laws at any time, which may affect market perceptions of our Company and the market price of our shares could be negatively affected.\nOur Company is subject to changes in tax laws and changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws. We are subject to various taxing regimes, including federal, state, local and foreign taxes such as income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, property, gross receipts, withholding and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws\nand regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future and have a material adverse effect on our Company's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur Company and our subsidiaries are subject to examinations and challenges by taxing authorities. Periodic examinations or audits by taxing authorities could increase our tax liabilities and result in the imposition of interest and penalties. If challenges arising from such examinations and audits are not resolved in our Company's favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our Company's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.", "PERMNO": 90507, "SIC": 4581, "TIC": "MIC"}
