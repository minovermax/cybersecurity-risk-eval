Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Forward-Looking Statements\nThis annual report and our other oral or written communications may contain \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements. These statements include our expectations or projections about the future of our industries, business strategies, the markets in which we operate, potential acquisitions, contracts with customers, new business opportunities, controlling or cutting our costs, winning new customers, returning to profitability on a consolidated basis, our financial results, our financial condition and our views about developments beyond our control, including government spending, domestic or global economic conditions, trends and market forces. These statements are based on management\u2019s views and assumptions at the time originally made, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as may be required by law. There can be no assurance that our expectations, projections or views will come to pass, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\nA number of significant risk factors could materially affect our specific business operations and cause our performance to differ materially from any future results projected or implied by our prior statements, including those described below. Many of these risk factors are also identified in connection with the more specific descriptions contained throughout this report.\nCustomers and Revenue Growth\nWe have experienced recent operating losses, and anticipate further operating losses in the near term, as we seek to generate new business revenues to replace the nonrenewal of several large customer contracts.\nOur businesses generally require a higher level of new business revenues in order to operate profitably. We have recently experienced operating losses and may not become profitable if we are unable to execute on management\u2019s plans. We are working to increase our revenues with new and existing customers. However, without near term success, we may be unable to maintain the critical mass of capital investments or talented employees that are needed to succeed in our chosen markets or to maintain our existing facilities, which could result in additional restructuring or exit costs. As we expand our customers and our products, we must also effectively manage a more diverse production schedule to avoid slowing our production output. As we are awarded new products with new customers, we must onboard new operational processes in an effective and efficient manner. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete final contract negotiations with regard to our announced contract \u201corders\u201d, \u201cwins\u201d or \u201cawards\u201d or that these contracts will generate the additional revenue needed to return to profitability.\nWe depend on a few key customers in challenging industries for most of our revenues.\nOur five largest customers in 2019 were Sistemas, Detroit Diesel, Northrop Grumman, L3Harris and SubCom, which in the aggregate accounted for 61% of net revenue. While we have reduced the dependence of Sypris Technologies on certain non-strategic customers, an inability to increase our revenues while effectively controlling our costs would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2020 and beyond, we will need to continue attracting new clients and diversifying our customer base, despite the longer lead times typically required for new programs.\nThe truck components and assemblies industry has experienced consolidation, credit risk, highly cyclical market demand, labor unrest, rising steel costs, bankruptcy and other obstacles. We expect the North America truck market\u2019s economic climate to deteriorate as compared to 2019. The medium/heavy truck market in North America is expected to be down considerably in 2020, with Class 8 demand down over 30% and Classes 5-7 lower by approximately 10% compared to 2019. In the light vehicle market, light truck demand in 2020 is expected to be comparable to slightly weaker than 2019. The demand for our energy-related products lines, historically, has risen and fallen with the prices of oil and/or natural gas, as our customers\u2019 capital expenditures budgets tend to be dependent upon energy prices. We depend on the continued growth and financial stability of customers in these industries and our core markets, as well as general economic conditions. Adverse changes affecting these customers, markets or economic conditions could harm our operating results.\nThe aerospace and defense electronics industry has experienced consolidation, increased competition, disruptive new technologies and uncertain funding levels. The aerospace and defense industry is also pressured by cyclicality, rapid technological change, shortening product life cycles, decreasing margins, component obsolescence and shortages and government procurement and certification processes. Our aerospace and defense business faces reduced revenues in the final phases of several key legacy programs which must be replenished with new technologies if we are to successfully maintain or expand our market share. Our failure to address any of these factors could impair our ability to grow and diversify our base of customers in this segment.\nThere can be no assurance that any of our customers will not default on, delay or dispute payment of, or seek to reject our outstanding invoices in bankruptcy or otherwise. In addition, the existence of these factors may result in fewer customers in our target markets due to consolidation, bankruptcy, competitive or other market reasons, making it more difficult to obtain new clients and diversify our customer base in the near future.\nCustomer contracts could be less profitable than expected.\nWe generally bear the risk that our contracts could be unprofitable or less profitable than planned, despite our estimates of revenues and future costs to complete such contracts.\nA material portion of our business, historically, has been conducted under multi-year contracts, which generally include fixed prices or periodic price reductions without minimum purchase requirements. Over time, our revenues may not cover any increases in our operating costs which could adversely impact our results. Our financial results are at greater risk when we accept contractual responsibility for raw material or component prices, when we cannot offset price reductions, freight penalties, importation fees and cost increases with operating efficiencies or other savings, when we must submit contract bid prices before all key design elements are finalized or when we are subjected to other competitive pressures which erode our margins. The profitability of our contracts also can be adversely affected by unexpected start-up costs on new programs, inability to negotiate milestone billings, operating inefficiencies, scheduling constraints, ineffective capital investments, inflationary pressures or inaccurate forecasts of future unit costs.\nUnexpected changes in our customers\u2019 demand levels and our ability to execute our production efficiently have harmed our operating results in the past and could do so in the future. Many of our customers will not commit to firm production or delivery schedules. Inaccurate forecasting of our customers\u2019 requirements can disrupt the efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, inventories or workforce and can cause increases in our inventory and working capital levels. If we receive unanticipated orders or rapid increases in demand, these incremental volumes could be unprofitable due to the higher costs of operating above our optimal capacity. Disagreements over pricing, quality, delivery, capacity, exclusivity or trade credit terms could disrupt order schedules. Orders may also fluctuate due to changing global capacity and demand, new products, changes in market share, reorganizations or bankruptcies, material shortages, labor disputes, freight costs, tariffs or other factors that discourage outsourcing. These forces could increase, decrease, accelerate, delay or cancel our delivery schedules.\nOur ability to stabilize employee retention and execute on existing customer orders could put current revenues at risk as we proceed with the execution of our plans. If we lose anticipated revenues, we might not succeed in redeploying our substantial capital investments and other fixed costs, potentially forcing additional plant closures, impairments of long-lived and other assets or increased losses.\nCongressional budgetary constraints or reallocations could reduce our government related sales.\nSypris Electronics serves as a contractor for large aerospace and defense companies such as Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and L3Harris, typically under federally funded programs, which represented approximately 23% and 25% of net revenue in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSypris Electronics was adversely affected by declines in the overall government defense market due to the effects of sequestration in the past, and may be further affected if funding for programs in which we participate, either by selling products directly to U.S. government agencies or as a subcontractor to prime contractors such as Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, SubCom, LLC (SubCom) and ADI, is reduced, delayed or cancelled. Our ability to obtain new contract awards also could be negatively affected.\nCompetition\nIncreasing competition could limit or reduce our market share.\nAs an outsourced manufacturer, we operate in highly competitive environments that often include our customers\u2019 internal capabilities. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the availability of manufacturing capacity, increasingly unfavorable currency exchange rates (especially in low-cost countries), technological strength, speed and flexibility in responding to design or schedule changes, price, quality, delivery, cost management and financial strength. Our earnings could decline if our competitors or customers can provide comparable speed and quality at a lower cost, or if we fail to adequately invest in the range and quality of products our customers require.\nMany of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and organizational resources, geographic breadth and range of products, customer bases and brand recognition than we do. As a result, our competitors may respond more quickly to technological changes or customer needs, consume lower fixed and variable unit costs, negotiate reduced component prices, and obtain better terms for financing growth. If we fail to compete in any of these areas, we may lose market share and our business could be seriously harmed. There can be no assurance that we will not experience increased competition or that we will be able to achieve profitability as these new challenges arise.\nOur technologies could become obsolete, reducing our revenues and profitability.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by changing technology and continuing process development. The future of our business will depend in large part upon the continuing relevance of our technological capabilities. We could fail to make required capital investments, develop or successfully market products that meet changing customer needs and anticipate or respond to technological changes in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our inability to successfully launch or sustain new or next generation programs or product features, especially in accordance with budgets or committed delivery schedules, could materially adversely affect our financial results. We could encounter competition from new or developing technologies that render our technologies and equipment less profitable or obsolete in our chosen markets and our operating results may suffer. In particular, the Company is currently developing new products and pursuing new programs in an attempt to increase Sypris Electronics\u2019 revenue stream. However, commercializing the new products and programs is costly and has been slower than anticipated. The launch of any new products or programs within Sypris Electronics may not be successful.\nExecution\nContract terminations or delays could harm our business.\nWe often provide products under contracts that contain detailed specifications, quality standards and other terms. If we are unable to perform in accordance with such terms, our customers might seek to terminate such contracts, demand price concessions or other financial consideration or downgrade our performance ratings or eligibility for new business. Moreover, many of our contracts are subject to termination for convenience or upon default. These provisions could provide only limited recoveries of certain incurred costs or profits on completed work and could impose liability for our customers\u2019 costs in procuring undelivered items from another source. If any of our significant contracts were to be repudiated, terminated or not renewed, we could lose substantial revenues, and our operating results as well as prospects for future business opportunities could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various audits, reviews and investigations, including private party \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lawsuits, relating to our compliance with federal and state laws. Should our business be charged with wrongdoing, or determined not to be a \u201cpresently responsible contractor,\u201d we could be temporarily suspended or debarred from receiving new government contracts or government-approved subcontracts.\nWe must operate more efficiently due to lower revenues.\nIf we are unable to improve the cost, efficiency and yield of our operations, and if we are not able to control costs, our financial results could suffer and we could be forced to sell additional assets, take on additional debt at higher costs or take other measures to restructure our operations or capital structure. A number of major obstacles could include:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties arising from our present financial condition, including difficulties in maintaining customer and supplier relationships and difficulties acquiring new business due to lingering concerns until we have returned to consistent profitability;\n\u25cf\nefforts to increase our manufacturing capacity, maintain quality control systems and launch new programs, especially as we increase production at our Mexico operations;\n\u25cf\nthe breakdown or the need for major repairs of critical machinery or equipment, especially as we increase production at our Mexico operations;\n\u25cf\nthe risk of warranty and product liability claims, as well as product recalls, if our products fail to perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death;\n\u25cf\ninflationary pressures;\n\u25cf\ntariffs or trade restrictions imposed on imports or exports, particularly in the United States and Mexico;\n\u25cf\nincreased borrowing due to declines in sales;\n\u25cf\nchanges in anticipated product mix and the associated variances in our profit margins;\n\u25cf\nthe need to identify and eliminate our root causes of scrap;\n\u25cf\nour ability to achieve expected annual savings or other synergies from past and future business combinations;\n\u25cf\ninventory risks due to forecasting errors, shifts in market demand, the unanticipated loss of future business, or the obsolescence and/or price erosion of raw materials or component parts on hand;\n\u25cf\nany inability to successfully manage growth, contraction or competitive pressures in our primary markets.\nOur management or systems could be inadequate to support our existing or future operations, especially as we downsize our operating staff to reduce expenses while we work to increase revenues. New customers or new contracts, particularly with new product offerings, could require us to invest in additional equipment or other capital expenditures which exceed our budgeted plans. We may have limited experience or expertise in installing or operating such equipment, which could negatively impact our ability to deliver products on time or with acceptable costs. In addition, a material portion of our manufacturing equipment requires significant maintenance to operate effectively, and we may experience maintenance and repair issues. The risk of technical failures, nonconformance with customer specifications, an inability to deliver next generation products or other quality concerns could materially impair our operating results. Similarly, expanding production for our energy-related products without effective process controls could materially increase scrap rates and may impact the safety of our operating environment.\nCyber security risks could negatively affect operations and result in increased costs.\nSypris Electronics, as a U.S. defense contractor, and our Company overall, face cyber security threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees and terrorist or criminal acts, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures and natural disasters.\nWe routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nAlthough we work cooperatively with our customers and our suppliers, subcontractors, and other partners to seek to minimize the impacts of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities, and those safeguards might not be effective.\nThe costs related to cyber security or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the products we provide to customers, loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts, early obsolescence of our products, our future financial results, our reputation or our stock price.\nSuppliers\nInterruptions in the supply of key components and quality systems could disrupt production.\nSome of our products require one or more components that are available from a limited number of providers or from sole-source providers. In the past, some of the materials we use, including steel, certain forgings or castings, capacitors and memory and logic devices, have been subject to industry-wide shortages or capacity allocations. As a result, suppliers have been forced to allocate available quantities among their customers, and we have not been able to obtain all of the materials desired. Some of our suppliers have struggled to implement reliable quality control systems which can negatively impact our operating efficiency and financial results. In downward business cycles, the tightening of credit markets has threatened the financial viability of an increasing number of suppliers of key components and raw materials and forced unanticipated shutdowns. Our inability to reliably obtain these or any other materials when and as needed could slow production or assembly, delay shipments to our customers, cause noncompliance with product certifications, impair the recovery of our fixed costs and increase the costs of recovering to customers\u2019 schedules, including overtime, expedited freight, equipment maintenance, operating inefficiencies, higher working capital and the obsolescence risks associated with larger buffer inventories. Each of these factors could adversely affect operating results.\nShortages or increased costs of utilities could harm our business and our customers.\nWe and our customers depend on a constant supply of electricity and natural gas from utility providers for the operation of our respective businesses and facilities. In the past, we have experienced power outages which reduced our ability to deliver products and meet our customers\u2019 demand for those products. If we or our customers experience future interruptions in service from these providers, our production and/or delivery of products could be negatively affected. We have experienced increased costs due to the heavy consumption of energy in our production process, which have been offset through revised production schedules. However, if the cost of energy continues to increase, our results of operations and those of certain customers could be negatively impacted.\nFluctuations in the price of raw materials, including tariffs or other trade restrictions on imported steel or other goods, could negatively impact us.\nFor significant portions of our business, we purchase raw materials and component parts which have been designated or specified by our customers, at prices negotiated by our customers. Raw material price fluctuations and volatility in the commodity markets, including tariffs and trade restriction could impact prices in the future. While our customers have generally agreed to reimburse us for the cost of such materials, this could change in the future, and our risks will continue to include the timely communication and successful collection of any such reimbursements. In any event, for a growing part of our business, we arrange our own suppliers and we could be impacted by the risks of any landed price increases, trade restrictions or production delays. Increases in the costs of steel or other supplies could also increase our working capital requirements, scrap expenses and borrowing costs.\nIn general, there can be no assurance that any price fluctuations relating to tariffs or trade restrictions will not reduce demand, slow production, delay shipments to our customers or increase our costs in the future, any of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nAccess to Capital and Acquisitions\nUntil we have returned to sustained levels of profitability, our access to capital may be limited.\nUntil the Company becomes profitable again, there can be no assurances that the Company will succeed in attracting new, affordable, sources of debt or equity capital. If we are unable to become profitable on a timely basis, we may need to use existing cash resources or other assets to fund operating losses. While we have borrowed from Gill Family Capital Management, Inc. (\u201cGFCM\u201d) on acceptable terms in the past, there can be no assurances that such debt financing would be available in the future.\nOur ability to finance expansion or new business opportunities may be limited.\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements depend on numerous factors other than bank borrowings or debt financing, including the pace at which we can effectively cut costs, increase revenues or successfully launch new products. One method we have historically used to increase our revenues and obtain multi-year supply agreements is to buy a customer\u2019s non-core manufacturing assets, or to acquire alternative, but equivalent, production capabilities and to produce products for such customers under a multi-year contract. We have also pursued strategies that rely on research and development efforts to develop and commercialize our new products. We may not have the financial resources or be able to raise funds necessary to pursue these strategies under our future debt agreements which could further limit our ability to replace the loss of revenues.\nOur growth strategies could be ineffective due to the risks associated with further acquisitions.\nOur growth strategy has included acquiring complementary businesses. We could fail to identify, obtain financing or complete suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms and prices. Acquisition efforts entail a number of risks, including: diversion of management\u2019s attention; difficulties in integrating systems, operations and cultures; potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies; lack of experience operating in the geographic market of the acquired business; an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements; risks of entering into markets or producing products where we have limited or no experience; difficulties in integrating purchased technologies and products with our technologies and products; our ability to improve productivity and implement cost reductions; our ability to secure collective bargaining agreements with employees; and exposure to unanticipated liabilities.\nOur discovery of, or failure to discover, material issues during due diligence investigations of acquisition targets, either before closing with regard to potential risks of the acquired operations, or after closing with regard to the timely discovery of breaches of representations or warranties, or of certain indemnified environmental conditions, could seriously harm our business.\nWe could fail to fully implement our growth plans.\nAs the Company seeks to expand its revenues and strategically diversify its customer base, we could fail to adequately overcome significant obstacles such as slowing markets, the loss of key employees, unexpected increases in costs, or new competitors or technologies in our key markets, among other risks. The failure to fully implement our growth plans could materially adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial condition.\nLabor Relations\nWe must attract and retain qualified employees while successfully managing related costs.\nOur future success in a changing business environment, including during rapid changes in the size, complexity or skills required of our workforce, as we experienced in 2018 and 2017, will depend to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive, managerial and technical employees. The loss of key employees, especially in a strong economic environment, and our ability to effectively train existing employees, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our future success will also require an ability to attract and retain qualified employees, especially those with engineering or production expertise in our core business lines.\nChanges in our labor costs such as salaries, wages and benefits, or the cost of providing pension and other employee benefits, changes in health care costs, investment returns on plan assets and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities or other requirements to accelerate the level of our pension fund contributions to reduce or eliminate underfunded liabilities, could lead to increased costs or disruptions of operations in any of our business units.\nDisputes with labor unions could disrupt our business plans.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 359 employees (all of which were in Sypris Technologies), or 57% of our total employees. Excluding certain Mexico employees covered under an annually ratified agreement, there are no collective bargaining agreements expiring within the next 12 months. Certain Mexico employees are covered by an annually ratified collective bargaining agreement. These employees in Mexico represented approximately 51% of the Company\u2019s workforce, or 319 employees at December 31, 2019. Our ability to maintain our workforce depends on our ability to attract and retain new and existing customers. We could experience a work stoppage or other disputes which could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and could harm our operating results.\nRegulatory\nEnvironmental, natural disasters, health and safety risks could expose us to potential liability.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals and substances used in our operations. If we fail to comply with present or future regulations, we could be forced to alter, suspend or discontinue our manufacturing processes and pay substantial fines or penalties.\nGroundwater and other contamination has occurred at certain of our current and former facilities during the operation of those facilities by their former owners, and this contamination may occur at future facilities we operate or acquire. There is no assurance that environmental indemnification agreements we have secured from the former owners of certain of these properties will be adequate to protect us from liability.\nOur business is also subject to potential liabilities with respect to health and safety matters. We are required to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the health and safety of our workforce, and we could be held liable for damages arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other dangerous working conditions. Health and safety laws and regulations are complex and change frequently. As a result, our future costs to comply with such laws or the liabilities incurred in the event of any violations may increase significantly.\nA natural disaster could disrupt our operations, or our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have plans designed to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on our operations, those plans may be insufficient, and any catastrophe may disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. For example, during December 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in Wuhan, China has resulted in travel disruption, trade disruption and has effected certain companies\u2019 operations in China and several other countries. At this point in time, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain. Infections may become more widespread, including to other countries where we have operations, and travel restrictions may remain or worsen, all of which could lead to reduced demand for our products and services, disruptions in our supply chain, any of which could have a negative impact on our business and operating results. Under our self-insured employee health program, the costs associated with a large number of employees infected could significantly impact our results.\nChanges in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability.\nWe have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline. Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future. A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nOur provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. introduced broad ranging tax reform with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cAct\u201d) legislation. Among the tax reforms was a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Although the tax reform in the U.S. reduced the statutory tax rate to 21% for 2018, the effects of the lower rate were offset in part by the effects of increased nondeductible expenses and the global intangible low taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) provisions which result in a certain amount of foreign earnings being subjected to U.S. tax. Considering the exclusion of foreign subsidiary dividends from taxation in the U.S., we believe the Act will provide some greater flexibility to repatriate future earnings of our foreign operations.\nOur income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations.\nAdverse regulatory developments or litigation could harm our business.\nOur businesses operate in heavily regulated environments. We must successfully manage the risk of changes in or adverse actions under applicable law or in our regulatory authorizations, licenses and permits, governmental security clearances or other legal rights to operate our businesses, to manage our work force or to import and export goods and services as needed. Our business activities expose us to the risks of litigation with respect to our customers, suppliers, creditors, stockholders or from product liability, environmental or asbestos-related matters. We also face the risk of other adverse regulatory actions, compliance costs or governmental sanctions, as well as the costs and risks related to our ongoing efforts to design and implement effective internal controls.\nOther Risks\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statement or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nUnder Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required, among other things, to assess and report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that pertain to our ERP system conversion that took place on January 1, 2019 involving (1) the ineffective design and implementation of effective controls with respect to the ERP system conversion, and (2) inadequate or ineffective process level and monitoring controls in the area of accounting close and financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Although we believe the material weakness has since been remediated, we cannot assure that the measures we have taken to date, and are continuing to implement, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to identify or prevent future material weaknesses. If other material weaknesses or other deficiencies occur, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position could be impaired, which could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nImplementation of our new enterprise resource planning system has adversely impacted and could continue to negatively affect our business.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to assist us in managing our business and summarizing our operational results. On January 1, 2019 we deployed a new ERP system at Sypris Electronics. The new ERP system was implemented to position the Company for long-term growth, further enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of our business operations, including sales order processing, inventory control, purchasing and supply chain management, and financial reporting. Implementing the new ERP system has been costly and has required, and may continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. In addition to the risks inherent in the conversion to any new IT system, including the loss of information, disruption to our normal operations, and changes in accounting procedures, the implementation of our new ERP system has resulted in reporting disruptions related to maintaining an effective internal control environment.\nFailure to properly or adequately address any issues with our new ERP system could result in increased costs and the diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our operating results, internal control over financial reporting and ability to manage our business effectively. While the ERP system is intended to further improve and enhance our information management systems, the ongoing implementation of this new ERP system exposes us to the risks of integrating that system with our existing systems and processes, including possible continued disruption of our financial reporting.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\nWe carry a range of insurance policies intended to protect our assets and operations, including general liability insurance and property damage insurance. While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages, and as a result our insurance program may not fully cover us for losses we may incur. In addition, as a result of a number of catastrophic weather and other events in the United States, insurance companies have incurred substantial losses and accordingly in many cases they have substantially reduced the nature and amount of insurance coverage available to the market, have broadened exclusions, and/or have substantially increased the cost of such coverage. It is likely that the tight insurance market will continue into the foreseeable future. Our business requires that we maintain various types of insurance. If such insurance is not available or not available on economically acceptable terms, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face other factors which could seriously disrupt our operations.\nMany other risk factors beyond our control could seriously disrupt our operations, including: risks relating to war, future terrorist activities, or political uncertainties; risks relating to natural disasters or other casualties which could shut down our domestic or foreign facilities, disrupt transportation of products or supplies, increase the costs under our self-insurance program or change the timing and availability of funding in our aerospace and defense electronics markets; risks inherent in operating abroad, including foreign currency exchange rates, adverse regulatory developments, and miscommunications or errors due to inaccurate foreign language translations or currency exchange rates; or our failure to anticipate or to adequately insure against other risks and uncertainties present in our businesses including unknown or unidentified risks.", "PERMNO": 80534, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "SYPR"}
