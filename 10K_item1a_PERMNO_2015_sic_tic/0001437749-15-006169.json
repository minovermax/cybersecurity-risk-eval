RISK FACTORS.\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our operations. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected, and in the future could affect our operations and financial condition. Additional risks we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could significantly disrupt our business.\nAs a professional and technical engineering and consulting solutions provider, our business is labor intensive and, therefore, our ability to attract, retain, and expand our senior management, sales personnel, and professional and technical staff is an important factor in determining our future success. The market for qualified scientists, engineers, and sales personnel is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain such professionals. It may also be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals in the timeframe demanded by our clients. Furthermore, some of our government contracts may require us to employ only individuals who have particular government security clearance levels. Our failure to attract and retain key individuals could impair our ability to provide services to our clients and conduct our business effectively. In addition, with the exception of certain of our executive officers, we do not have employment agreements with any of our employees. The loss of the services of any key personnel could adversely affect our business. We do not maintain key-man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers.\nWe depend on the continued services of Mr. Dickerson Wright, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain the services Mr. Wright.\nWe are dependent upon the efforts and services of Mr. Dickerson Wright, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, because of his knowledge, experience, skills, and relationships with major clients and other members of our management team. The loss of the services of Mr. Wright for any reason could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nDemand from our state and local government and private clients is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns. If the economy weakens or client spending declines further, then our revenue, profits, and financial condition may deteriorate.\nDemand for services from our state and local government and private clients is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns, which may result in clients delaying, curtailing, or canceling proposed and existing projects. Our business traditionally lags the overall recovery in the economy. Therefore, our business may not recover immediately when the economy improves. If the economy remains weak or client spending declines further, then our revenue, profits, and overall financial condition may deteriorate. Our state and local government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding new or existing projects. In addition, our existing and potential clients may either postpone entering into new contracts or request price concessions. Difficult financing and economic conditions may cause some of our clients to demand better pricing terms or delay payments for services we perform, thereby increasing the average number of days our receivables are outstanding and the potential of increased credit losses on uncollectible invoices. Further, these conditions may result in the inability of some of our clients to pay us for services that we have already performed. If we are not able to reduce our costs quickly enough to respond to the revenue decline from these clients, our operating results may be adversely affected. Accordingly, these factors affect our ability to forecast our future revenue and earnings from business areas that may be adversely impacted by market conditions.\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address.\nOver the past several years, the general worldwide economy has experienced a downturn due, at various times, to the lack of available credit, slower economic activity, concerns about inflation and deflation, increased energy costs, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, and adverse business conditions. These conditions make it extremely difficult for our clients and vendors to accurately forecast future business activities, which could cause businesses to slow spending on services. Such conditions have also made it very difficult for us to predict the short-term and long-term impacts on our business. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our industry, and any such economic slowdown could have any adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur revenue, expenses, and operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur revenue, expenses, and operating results may fluctuate significantly because of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. In addition to the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, the following factors could cause our operating results to fluctuate:\n\u25cf\ndelays, increased costs, or other unanticipated changes in contract performance that may affect profitability, particularly with contracts that are fixed-price or have funding limits;\n\u25cf\nseasonality of the spending cycle of our public sector clients, notably the U.S. federal government, the spending patterns of our private sector clients, and weather conditions;\n\u25cf\nbudget constraints experienced by our federal, state, and local government clients;\n\u25cf\nour ability to integrate any companies that we acquire;\n\u25cf\nthe number and significance of client contracts commenced and completed during a quarter;\n\u25cf\nthe continuing creditworthiness and solvency of clients;\n\u25cf\nreductions in the prices of services offered by our competitors; and\n\u25cf\nlegislative and regulatory enforcement policy changes that may affect demand for our services.\nAs a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe derive a majority of our gross revenues from government agencies, and any disruption in government funding or in our relationship with those agencies could adversely affect our business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 55% and 67%, respectively, of our gross revenues were attributable to public and quasi-public sector clients, of which approximately 78% and 81% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were attributable to public and quasi-public sector clients in California. A significant amount of our revenues are derived under multi-year contracts, many of which are appropriated on an annual basis. As a result, at the beginning of a project, the related contract may be only partially funded, and additional funding is normally committed only as appropriations are made in each subsequent year. These appropriations, and the timing of payment of appropriated amounts, may be influenced by numerous factors as noted below. Our backlog includes only the projects that have had funding appropriated.\nThe demand for our government-related services is generally driven by the level of government program funding. Accordingly, the success and further development of our business depends, in large part, upon the continued funding of these government programs, and upon our ability to obtain contracts and perform well under these programs. There are several factors that could materially affect our government contracting business, including the following:\n\u25cf\nuncertainty surrounding how any remaining funds are being distributed under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\u201cARRA\u201d) and into what governmental areas such funds are being used, and how much funding may remain available;\n\u25cf\nchanges in and delays or cancellations of government programs, requirements, or appropriations;\n\u25cf\nbudget constraints or policy changes resulting in delay or curtailment of expenditures related to the services we provide;\n\u25cf\nre-competes of government contracts;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and amount of tax revenue received by federal, state, and local governments, and the overall level of government expenditures;\n\u25cf\ncurtailment in the use of government contracting firms;\n\u25cf\ndelays associated with insufficient numbers of government staff to oversee contracts;\n\u25cf\nthe increasing preference by government agencies for contracting with small and disadvantaged businesses, including the imposition of set percentages of prime and subcontracts to be awarded to such businesses for which we would not qualify;\n\u25cf\ncompeting political priorities and changes in the political climate with regard to the funding or operation of the services we provide;\n\u25cf\nthe adoption of new laws or regulations affecting our contracting relationships with the federal, state, or local governments;\n\u25cf\na dispute with, or improper activity by, any of our subcontractors; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic or political conditions.\nThese and other factors could cause government agencies to delay or cancel programs, to reduce their orders under existing contracts, to exercise their rights to terminate contracts, or not to exercise contract options for renewals or extensions. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our revenue or timing of contract payments from these agencies.\nEach year, client funding for some of our government contracts may rely on government appropriations or public-supported financing. If adequate public funding is delayed or is not available, then our profits and revenue could decline.\nEach year, client funding for some of our government contracts may directly or indirectly rely on government appropriations or public-supported financing such as the ARRA. It is possible that such appropriated funding will never be allocated to projects that represent opportunities for us to the extent that we anticipate, if at all. Legislatures may appropriate funds for a given project on a year-by-year basis, even though the project may take more than one year to perform. In addition, public-supported financing such as state and local municipal bonds may be only partially raised to support existing projects. Public funds and the timing of payment of these funds may be influenced by, among other things, the state of the economy, competing political priorities, curtailments in the use of government contracting firms, increases in raw material costs, delays associated with insufficient numbers of government staff to oversee contracts, budget constraints, the timing and amount of tax receipts, and the overall level of government expenditures. If adequate public funding is not available or is delayed, then our profits and revenue could decline.\nA delay in the completion of the budget process of the U.S. government could delay procurement of our services and have an adverse effect on our future revenue.\nWhen the U.S. government does not complete its budget process before its fiscal year-end on September 30 in any year, government operations are typically funded by means of a continuing resolution. Under a continuing resolution, the government essentially authorizes agencies of the U.S. government to continue to operate and fund programs at the prior year end but does not authorize new spending initiatives. When the U.S. government operates under a continuing resolution, government agencies may delay the procurement of services, which could reduce our future revenue.\nCalifornia state budgetary constraints may have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe state of California had experienced, and may continue to experience, budget shortfalls and other related budgetary issues and constraints. The state of California has historically been and is considered to be a key geographic region for our business, as approximately 45% and 65% of our gross revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, came from California-based projects. Ongoing uncertainty as to the timing and accessibility of budgetary funding, changes in state funding allocations to local agencies and municipalities, or other delays in purchasing for, or commencement of, projects may have a negative impact on our gross revenues and net income.\nGovernmental agencies may modify, curtail, or terminate our contracts at any time prior to their completion and, if we do not replace them, we may suffer a decline in revenue.\nMost government contracts may be modified, curtailed, or terminated by the government either at its discretion or upon the default of the contractor. If the government terminates a contract at its discretion, then we typically are able to recover only costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on work completed prior to termination, which could prevent us from recognizing all of our potential revenue and profits from that contract. In addition, the U.S. government has announced its intention to scale back outsourcing of services in favor of \u201cinsourcing\u201d jobs to its employees, which could reduce the number of contracts awarded to us. The adoption of similar practices by other government entities could also adversely affect our revenues. If a government terminates a contract due to our default, we could be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in obtaining services from another source.\nOur failure to win new contracts and renew existing contracts with private and public sector clients could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur business depends on our ability to win new contracts and renew existing contracts with private and public sector clients. Contract proposals and negotiations are complex and frequently involve a lengthy bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors. These factors include market conditions, financing arrangements, and required governmental approvals. For example, a client may require us to provide a bond or letter of credit to protect the client should we fail to perform under the terms of the contract. If negative market conditions arise, or if we fail to secure adequate financial arrangements or the required government approval, we may not be able to pursue particular projects, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes or preferences granted to certain bidders for which we would not qualify could harm our operations and significantly reduce or eliminate our profits.\nGovernment contracts are awarded through a regulated procurement process. The U.S. federal government has increasingly relied upon multi-year contracts with pre-established terms and conditions, such as indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (\u201cIDIQ\u201d) contracts, which generally require those contractors who have previously been awarded the IDIQ to engage in an additional competitive bidding process before a task order is issued. The increased competition, in turn, may require us to make sustained efforts to reduce costs in order to realize revenue and profits under government contracts. If we are not successful in reducing the amount of costs we incur, our profitability on government contracts will be negatively impacted. The U.S. federal government has also increased its use of IDIQs in which the client qualifies multiple contractors for a specific program and then awards specific task orders or projects among the qualified contractors. As a result, new work awards tend to be smaller and of shorter duration, since the orders represent individual tasks rather than large, programmatic assignments. In addition, the U.S. government has announced its intention to scale back outsourcing of services in favor of \u201cinsourcing\u201d jobs to its employees, which could reduce our revenue. Moreover, even if we are qualified to work on a government contract, we may not be awarded the contract because of existing government policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minority contractors, which would not apply to us. The federal government has announced specific statutory goals regarding awarding prime and subcontracts to small businesses, women-owned small businesses, and small disadvantaged businesses, with the result that we may be obligated to involve such businesses as subcontractors with respect to these contracts at lower margins than when we use our own professionals. While we are unaware of any reason why our status as a public company would negatively impact our ability to compete for and be awarded government contracts, our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes or as a result of the policies pursuant to which these processes are implemented could harm our operations and significantly reduce or eliminate our profits.\nIf we fail to complete a project in a timely manner, miss a required performance standard, or otherwise fail to adequately perform on a project, then we may incur a loss on that project, which may reduce or eliminate our overall profitability.\nOur engagements often involve large-scale, complex projects. The quality of our performance on such projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage the relationship with our clients and our ability to effectively manage the project and deploy appropriate resources, including third-party contractors and our own personnel, in a timely manner. We may commit to a client that we will complete a project by a scheduled date. We may also commit that a project, when completed, will achieve specified performance standards. If the project is not completed by the scheduled date or fails to meet required performance standards, we may either incur significant additional costs or be held responsible for the costs incurred by the client to rectify damages due to late completion or failure to achieve the required performance standards. The uncertainty of the timing of a project can present difficulties in planning the amount of personnel needed for the project. If the project is delayed or canceled, we may bear the cost of an underutilized workforce that was dedicated to fulfilling the project. In addition, performance of projects can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including unavoidable delays from government inaction, public opposition, inability to obtain financing, weather conditions, unavailability of vendor materials, changes in the project scope of services requested by our clients, industrial accidents, environmental hazards, labor disruptions, and other factors. To the extent these events occur, the total costs of the project could exceed our estimates and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, incur a loss on a project, which may reduce or eliminate our overall profitability. Further, any defects or errors, or failures to meet our clients\u2019 expectations, could result in claims for damages against us. Our contracts generally limit our liability for damages that arise from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering services to our clients. However, we cannot be sure that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages in the event we are sued.\nWe depend on a limited number of clients for a significant portion of our business.\nOur ten largest clients accounted for approximately 43% and 46% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, whereby two clients represented approximately 21% and 28% of our gross revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The loss of, or reduction in orders from, these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and adversely impact our business and operating results. Our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of the acquisitions, which could weaken our results of operations.\nA key part of our growth strategy is to acquire other companies that complement our service offerings or broaden our technical capabilities and geographic presence. Acquisitions involve certain known and unknown risks that could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts. For example:\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire additional companies on acceptable terms;\n\u25cf\nwe may pursue international acquisitions, which inherently pose more risk than domestic acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nwe compete with others to acquire companies, which may result in decreased availability of, or increased price for, suitable acquisition candidates;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to obtain the necessary financing on favorable terms, or at all, to finance any of our potential acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nwe may ultimately fail to consummate an acquisition even if we announce that we plan to acquire a company; and\n\u25cf\nacquired companies may not perform as we expect, and we may fail to realize anticipated revenue and profits.\nIn addition, our acquisition strategy may divert management\u2019s attention away from our existing businesses, resulting in the loss of key clients or key employees, and expose us to unanticipated problems or legal liabilities, including responsibility as a successor-in-interest for undisclosed or contingent liabilities of acquired businesses or assets.\nIf we are not able to integrate acquired businesses successfully, our business could be harmed.\nOur inability to successfully integrate future acquisitions could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of those acquisitions and could severely weaken our business operations. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, may preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us and could harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the combining companies may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, and competitive responses, and may cause our stock price to decline.\nThe difficulties of integrating an acquisition include, among others:\n\u25cf\nunanticipated issues in integration of information, communications, and other systems;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated incompatibility of logistics, marketing, and administration methods;\n\u25cf\nmaintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;\n\u25cf\nintegrating the business cultures of both companies;\n\u25cf\npreserving important strategic client relationships;\n\u25cf\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; and\n\u25cf\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations.\nIn addition, even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings, or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\nFurther, acquisitions may also cause us to:\n\u25cf\nissue securities that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentage;\n\u25cf\nuse a substantial portion of our cash resources;\n\u25cf\nincrease our interest expense, leverage, and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition;\n\u25cf\nassume liabilities, including environmental liabilities, for which we do not have indemnification from the former owners, as was the case in our acquisition of NV5, or have indemnification that may be subject to dispute or concerns regarding the creditworthiness of the former owners;\n\u25cf\nrecord goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential impairment charges;\n\u25cf\nexperience volatility in earnings due to changes in contingent consideration related to acquisition liability estimates;\n\u25cf\nincur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;\n\u25cf\nlose existing or potential contracts as a result of conflict of interest issues;\n\u25cf\nincur large and immediate write-offs; or\n\u25cf\nbecome subject to litigation.\nFinally, acquired companies that derive a significant portion of their revenue from the U.S. federal government and that do not follow the same cost accounting policies and billing practices that we follow may be subject to larger cost disallowances for greater periods than we typically encounter. If we fail to determine the existence of unallowable costs and do not establish appropriate reserves in advance of an acquisition, we may be exposed to material unanticipated liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are not able to successfully manage our growth strategy, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur expected future growth presents numerous managerial, administrative, operational, and other challenges. Our ability to manage the growth of our operations will require us to continue to improve our management information systems and our other internal systems and controls. In addition, our growth will increase our need to attract, develop, motivate, and retain both our management and professional employees. The inability of our management to effectively manage our growth or the inability of our employees to achieve anticipated performance could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from achieving our growth objectives.\nWe may in the future be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. Additional equity financing may dilute the interests of our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively with competitors.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. Our competitors are numerous, ranging from small private firms to multi-billion dollar public companies. Contract awards are based primarily on quality of service, relevant experience, staffing capabilities, reputation, geographic presence, stability, and price. In addition, the technical and professional aspects of our services generally do not require large upfront capital expenditures and provide limited barriers against new competitors. Many of our competitors have achieved greater market penetration in some of the markets in which we compete and have more personnel, technical, marketing, and financial resources or financial flexibility than we do. As a result of the number of competitors in the industry, our clients may select one of our competitors on a project due to competitive pricing or a specific skill set. These competitive forces could force us to make price concessions or otherwise reduce prices for our services. If we are unable to maintain our competitiveness, our market share, revenue, and profits could decline.\nOur business and operating results could be adversely affected by losses under fixed-price contracts.\nFixed-price contracts require us to either perform all work under the contract for a specified lump sum or to perform an estimated number of units of work at an agreed price per unit, with the total payment determined by the actual number of units performed. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 10% and 11%, respectively of our revenue was recognized under fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts expose us to a number of risks not inherent in cost-plus and time and material contracts, including underestimation of costs, ambiguities in specifications, unforeseen costs or difficulties, problems with new technologies, delays beyond our control, failures of subcontractors to perform, and economic or other changes that may occur during the contract period. Losses under fixed-price contracts could be substantial and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf our clients delay in paying or fail to pay amounts owed to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAccounts receivable represent the largest asset on our balance sheet. While we take steps to evaluate and manage the credit risks relating to our clients, economic downturns or other events can adversely affect the markets we serve and our clients ability to pay, which could reduce our ability to collect all amounts due from clients. If our clients delay in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we extend a significant portion of our credit to clients in a specific geographic area or industry, we may experience disproportionately high levels of collection risk and nonpayment if those clients are adversely affected by factors particular to their geographic area or industry.\nOur clients include public and private entities that have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by the changing landscape in the global economy. We face collection risk as a normal part of our business where we perform services and subsequently bill our clients for such services. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 21% and 28% of gross revenues are from two clients. In the event that we have concentrated credit risk from clients in a specific geographic area or industry, continuing negative trends or a worsening in the financial condition of that specific geographic area or industry could make us susceptible to disproportionately high levels of default by those clients. Such defaults could materially adversely impact our ability to collect our receivables and, ultimately, our revenues and results of operations.\nAs a government contractor, we must comply with various procurement laws and regulations and are subject to regular government audits. A violation of any of these laws and regulations or the failure to pass a government audit could result in sanctions, contract termination, forfeiture of profit, harm to our reputation or loss of our status as an eligible government contractor and could reduce our profits and revenue.\nWe must comply with and are affected by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. For example, we must comply with defective-pricing clauses found within the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\u201cFAR\u201d), the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards (\u201cCAS\u201d), the ARRA, the Services Contract Act, and the U.S. Department of Defense security regulations, as well as many other rules and regulations. In addition, we must also comply with other government regulations related to employment practices, environmental protection, health and safety, tax, accounting, and anti-fraud measures, as well as many others regulations in order to maintain our government contractor status. These laws and regulations affect how we do business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. Although we take precautions to prevent and deter fraud, misconduct, and non-compliance, we face the risk that our employees or outside partners may engage in misconduct, fraud, or other improper activities. Government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These government agencies review and audit a government contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts and cost structure and evaluate compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. In addition, during the course of its audits, such agencies may question our incurred project costs. If such agencies believe we have accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with the requirements for FAR or CAS, the agency auditor may recommend to our U.S. government corporate administrative contracting officer that it disallow such costs. Historically, we have not experienced significant disallowed costs as a result of government audits. However, we can provide no assurance that such government audits will not result in a material disallowance for incurred costs in the future. In addition, government contracts are subject to a variety of other requirements relating to the formation, administration, performance and accounting for these contracts. We may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. Government contract violations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or sanctions, contract termination, forfeiture of profit, or suspension of payment, any of which could make us lose our status as an eligible government contractor. We could also suffer serious harm to our reputation. Any interruption or termination of our government contractor status could reduce our profits and revenue significantly.\nState and other public employee unions may bring litigation that seeks to limit the ability of public agencies to contract with private firms to perform government employee functions in the area of public improvements. Judicial determinations in favor of these unions could affect our ability to compete for contracts and may have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nOver at least the last 20 years, state and other public employee unions have challenged the validity of propositions, legislation, charters, and other government regulations that allow public agencies to contract with private firms to provide services in the fields of engineering, design, and construction of public improvements that might otherwise be provided by public employees. These challenges could have the affect of eliminating or severely restricting the ability of municipalities to hire private firms for the purpose of designing and constructing public improvements, and otherwise require them to use union employees to perform the services. If a state or other public employee union is successful in its challenge and as a result the ability of state agencies to hire private firms is severely limited, such a decision would likely lead to additional litigation challenging the ability of the state, counties, municipalities, and other public agencies to hire private engineering, architectural, and other firms, the outcome of which could affect our ability to compete for contracts and may have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nOur use of the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue and profits.\nWe account for some of our contracts on the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition. These contracts accounted for approximately 10% and 11% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Generally, our use of this method results in recognition of revenue and profit ratably over the life of the contract based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to total costs expected to be incurred for the entire project. The effects of revisions to revenue and estimated costs, including the achievement of award fees as well as the impact of change orders and claims, are recorded when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur in any period and their effects could be material. Although we have historically made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion of long-term contracts, the uncertainties inherent in the estimating process make it possible for actual costs to vary materially from estimates, including reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and profit.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements, which may significantly reduce or eliminate our profits.\nTo prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d), management is required to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions could affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. For example, we recognize revenue over the life of a contract based on the proportion of costs incurred to date compared to the total costs estimated to be incurred for the entire project. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:\n\u25cf\nthe application of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting and revenue recognition on contracts, change orders, and contract claims;\n\u25cf\nprovisions for uncollectible receivables and client claims and recoveries of costs from subcontractors, vendors, and others;\n\u25cf\nprovisions for income taxes, research, and experimentation credits and related valuation allowances;\n\u25cf\nvalue of goodwill and recoverability of other intangible assets;\n\u25cf\nvaluations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;\n\u25cf\nvaluation of stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u25cf\naccruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from those estimates, which may significantly reduce or eliminate our profits.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nManagement continues to review and assess our internal controls to ensure we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls. Failure to maintain new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in material weaknesses, and cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations (and, once we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act or a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined under related SEC rules, annual audit attestation reports) regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that will be required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) with respect to annual reports that we will file as a public company. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nFor so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, which may be up to five years following our initial public offering, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain adequate utilization of our workforce.\nThe cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. The rate at which we utilize our workforce is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire and assimilate new employees;\n\u25cf\nour ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforces;\n\u25cf\nour ability to manage attrition;\n\u25cf\nour need to devote time and resources to training, business development, professional development, and other non-chargeable activities; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to match the skill sets of our employees to the needs of the marketplace.\nIf we over utilize our workforce, our employees may become disengaged, which will impact employee attrition. If we under-utilize our workforce, our profit margin and profitability could suffer.\nOur backlog is subject to cancellation and unexpected adjustments, and is an uncertain indicator of future operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $82.1 million of gross revenue backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months. We include in backlog only those contracts for which funding has been provided and work authorizations have been received. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. In addition, project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur, from time to time, with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog. For example, certain of our contracts with the U.S. federal government and other clients are terminable at the discretion of the client, with or without cause. These types of backlog reductions could adversely affect our revenue and margins. Accordingly, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.\nEmployee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could harm our reputation, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.\nMisconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents, or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other foreign corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. For example, the FCPA, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these regulations and laws, and we take precautions to prevent and detect misconduct. However, since our internal controls are subject to inherent limitations, including human error, it is possible that these controls could be intentionally circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions. As a result, we cannot assure that our controls will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees and agents. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearances, and suspension or debarment from contracting, any or all of which could harm our reputation, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. Historically, we have not had any material cases involving misconduct or fraud.\nIf our contractors and subcontractors fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or if we are unable to maintain these relationships, our revenue, profitability, and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on contractors and subcontractors in conducting our business. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, client concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract. In addition, if any of our subcontractors fail to deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, fail to perform the agreed-upon services, go out of business, or fail to perform on a project, then our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized and we may be contractually responsible for the work performed by those contractors or subcontractors. The absence of qualified subcontractors with which we have a satisfactory relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts. Historically, our relationship with our contractors and subcontractors has been good, and we have not experienced any material failure of performance by our contractors and subcontractors. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the utilization of contractors or subcontractors generated approximately 15% and 18%, respectively, of our gross revenues.\nWe also rely on relationships with other contractors when we act as their subcontractor or joint venture partner. Our future revenue and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their subcontracts or teaming arrangement relationships with us or if a government agency terminates or reduces these other contractors\u2019 programs, does not award them new contracts, or refuses to pay under a contract.\nChanges in resource management or infrastructure industry laws, regulations, and programs could directly or indirectly reduce the demand for our services which could in turn negatively impact our revenue.\nSome of our services are directly or indirectly impacted by changes in U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign laws and regulations pertaining to resource management, infrastructure, and the environment. Accordingly, a relaxation or repeal of these laws and regulations, or changes in governmental policies regarding the funding, implementation, or enforcement of these programs, could result in a decline in demand for our services, which could in turn negatively impact our revenue.\nLegal proceedings, investigations, and disputes, including those assumed in acquisitions of other businesses for which we may not be indemnified, could result in substantial monetary penalties and damages, especially if such penalties and damages exceed or are excluded from existing insurance coverage.\nWe engage in professional and technical consulting and certification services that can result in substantial injury or damages that may expose us to legal proceedings, investigations, and disputes. For example, in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal disputes regarding personal injury claims, employee or labor disputes, professional liability claims, and general commercial disputes involving project cost overruns and liquidated damages as well as other claims. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we frequently make professional judgments and recommendations about environmental and engineering conditions of project sites for our clients. We may be deemed to be responsible for these judgments and recommendations if they are later determined to be inaccurate. Any unfavorable legal ruling against us could result in substantial monetary damages or even criminal violations.\nIn this regard, the agreement pursuant to which we acquired NV5, Inc. (formerly known as Nolte Associates, Inc.) did not include representations and warranties regarding the business being acquired or any indemnification provisions or other assurances from the seller regarding NV5, Inc. In the event any unforeseen matters arise, whether regarding the permits and authorizations required to run the NV5, Inc business, filing of tax returns and payment of associated taxes, or the existence or extent of any contingent liabilities of the NV5, Inc business (including third-party claims to which NV5, Inc may be subject in the future including regarding professional liability for work performed prior to our acquisition of NV5, Inc), we would be materially adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim for which no such indemnity has been provided. In this regard, in 2011, the California Franchise Tax Board (\u201cCFTB\u201d) initiated an examination of the state of California tax filings and raised questions about certain research and development tax credits generated and included on the tax returns of an acquired company for the years 2005 to 2009. We have been responding to inquiries generated by the CFTB regarding their agreed upon sample of contracts. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we received in writing some correspondence from the CFTB on this matter. There has been no final determination from the CFTB as to their acceptance of the filed tax credit. An extension was executed in March 2015, which extended the statute of limitations through September 2016 on the exam period. As a result of this correspondence received in the fourth quarter of 2014 from the CFTB, we concluded it would be prudent to record a reserve of $550 for the year ended December 31, 2014 which impacted the effective income tax rate.\nWe maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize our potential liabilities; however, insurance coverage contains exclusions and other limitations that may not cover our potential liabilities. Generally, our insurance program covers workers\u2019 compensation and employer\u2019s liability, general liability, automobile liability, professional errors and omissions liability, property, and contractor\u2019s pollution liability (in addition to other policies for specific projects). Our insurance program includes deductibles or self-insured retentions for each covered claim. In addition, our insurance policies contain exclusions that insurance providers may use to deny or restrict coverage. Specialty liability and professional liability insurance policies provide for coverages on a \u201cclaims-made\u201d basis, covering only claims actually made and reported during the policy period currently in effect. Our insurance programs provide coverage for acts or omissions associated with the Nolte business prior to our acquisition. If we sustain liabilities that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, including our profits and revenue.\nUnavailability or cancellation of third-party insurance coverage would increase our overall risk exposure as well as disrupt the management of our business operations.\nWe maintain insurance coverage from third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. If any of our third-party insurers fail, suddenly cancel our coverage, or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverage will be renewable upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at the required limits.\nOur failure to implement and comply with our safety program could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nOur safety program is a fundamental element of our overall approach to risk management, and the implementation of the safety program is a significant issue in our dealings with our clients. We maintain an enterprise-wide group of health and safety professionals to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes. Unsafe job sites and office environments have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable, and raise our operating costs. The implementation of our safety processes and procedures are monitored by various agencies and rating bureaus, and may be evaluated by certain clients in cases in which safety requirements have been established in our contracts. If we fail to meet these requirements or do not properly implement and comply with our safety program, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to liabilities under environmental laws and regulations, including liabilities assumed in acquisitions for which we may not be indemnified.\nWe must comply with a number of laws that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), and comparable state laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated hazardous materials. CERCLA and comparable state laws typically impose strict joint and several liabilities without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances. The liability for the entire cost of clean-up could be imposed upon any responsible party. Other principal federal environmental, health, and safety laws affecting us include, among others, the Resource Conversation and Recovery Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act. Our business operations may also be subject to similar state and international laws relating to environmental protection. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, or a failure to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial costs to us, including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or cessation of remediation activities. Our continuing work in the areas governed by these laws and regulations exposes us to the risk of substantial liability.\nWeather conditions and seasonal revenue fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nDue primarily to inclement weather conditions, which lead to project delays and slower completion of contracts, and a higher number of holidays, our operating results during December, January, and February are generally lower in comparison to other months. As a result, our revenue and net income for the first and fourth quarters of a fiscal year may be lower than our results for the second and third quarters of a fiscal year. If we were to experience lower-than-expected revenue during any such periods, our expenses may not be offset, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nForce majeure or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties, such as natural and man-made disasters as well as terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate by causing the closure of offices, interrupting projects, and forcing the relocation of employees. We typically remain obligated to perform our services after a terrorist action or natural disaster unless the contract contains a force majeure clause that relieves us of our contractual obligations in such an extraordinary event. If we are not able to react quickly to force majeure, our operations may be affected significantly, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFurther, we rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems, and our website for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services, and sales activities. Despite our implementation of network security measures, we are vulnerable to disruption, infiltration, or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data and could harm our future operating results.\nWe are highly dependent on information and communications systems. System failures, security breaches or cyber-attacks of networks or systems could significantly disrupt our business and operations and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur business is highly dependent on communications and information systems. These systems are primarily operated by third-parties and, as a result, we have limited ability to ensure their continued operation. In the event of systems failure or interruption, we will have limited ability to affect the timing and success of systems restoration. Any failure or interruption of our systems could cause delays or other problems in the delivery of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe rely on information technology systems, networks and infrastructure in managing our day-to-day operations. Despite cyber-security measures already in place, our information technology systems, networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to deliberate attacks or unintentional events that could interrupt or interfere with their functionality or the confidentiality of our information. Our inability to effectively utilize our information technology systems, networks and infrastructure, and protect our information could adversely affect our business.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. We rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property where we do not believe that patent or copyright protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection would adversely affect our competitive business position. In addition, if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party internal and outsourced software to run our critical accounting, project management, and financial information systems. As a result, any sudden loss, disruption, or unexpected costs to maintain these systems could significantly increase our operational expense and disrupt the management of our business operations.\nWe rely on third-party software to run our critical accounting, project management, and financial information systems. We also depend on our software vendors to provide long-term software maintenance support for our information systems. Software vendors may decide to discontinue further development, integration, or long-term software maintenance support for our information systems, in which case we may need to abandon one or more of our current information systems and migrate some or all of our accounting, project management, and financial information to other systems, thus increasing our operational expense as well as disrupting the management of our business operations.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer owns a large percentage of our voting stock, which may allow him to have a significant influence on all matters requiring stockholder approval.\nMr. Dickerson Wright, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 2,179,127 shares, or approximately 34.3% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of March 23, 2015. Accordingly, Mr. Wright has the power to significantly influence the outcome of important corporate decisions or matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including decisions regarding mergers, going private transactions, and other extraordinary transactions, and to significantly influence the terms of any of these transactions. Although Mr. Wright owes us and our stockholders certain fiduciary duties as a director and an executive officer, Mr. Wright could take actions to address his own interests, which may be different from those of our other stockholders.\nAs an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, we will utilize certain modified disclosure requirements, and we cannot be certain whether these reduced requirements will make our securities less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the rules under the Securities Act. We plan in current and future filings with the SEC to utilize, the modified disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, including reduced disclosure about our executive compensation and omission of compensation discussion and analysis, and an exemption from the requirement of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation. In addition, we will not be subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the additional testing of our internal control over financial reporting as may occur when outside auditors attest as to our internal control over financial reporting. For example, we will not have to provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on our internal controls in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, or in future annual reports on Form 10-K as otherwise required by Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important.\nWe could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company, and the requirements of being a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from our business.\nAs a result of our initial public offering, we became a public company and our securities are listed on NASDAQ. As such, we are required to comply with laws, regulations, and requirements that we did not need to comply with as a private company, including certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related SEC regulations, as well as the requirements of NASDAQ. Compliance with the requirements of being a public company have required us to increase our operating expenses in order to pay our employees, legal counsel, and accountants to assist us in, among other things, external reporting, instituting and monitoring a more comprehensive compliance and board governance function, establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws. In addition, in connection with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management was required to deliver a report that assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. However, in connection with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our auditors are not required to attest to our internal controls over financial reporting until we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act or as a smaller reporting company, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight will be required. As a result, our management\u2019s attention might be diverted from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, we might not be able to retain our independent directors or attract new independent directors for our committees.\nProvisions in our charter documents and the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and could discourage a takeover and adversely affect existing stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and in the Delaware General Corporation Law, could diminish the opportunity for stockholders to participate in acquisition proposals at a price above the then-current market price of our common stock. For example, while we have no present plans to issue any preferred stock, our board of directors, without further stockholder approval, will be able to issue Shares of undesignated preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences, and rights and any qualifications, limitations, and restrictions of such class or series, which could adversely affect the voting power of your Shares. In addition, our bylaws will provide for an advance notice procedure for nomination of candidates to our board of directors that could have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change in control. Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law regarding \u201cbusiness combinations,\u201d which can deter attempted takeovers in certain situations. We may, in the future, consider adopting additional anti-takeover measures. The authority of our board of directors to issue undesignated preferred or other capital stock and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as well as other current and any future anti-takeover measures adopted by us, may, in certain circumstances, delay, deter, or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control of our company not approved by our board of directors.\nWe currently do not pay dividends and do not intend to pay dividends on our shares of Common Stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your only current opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our shares appreciates.\nWe currently do not pay dividends and do not expect to pay dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future and intend to use cash to grow our business. The payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon such factors as the extent to which our financing arrangements permit the payment of dividends, earnings levels, capital requirements, our overall financial condition, and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Consequently, your only current opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates.", "PERMNO": 14166, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "NVEE"}
