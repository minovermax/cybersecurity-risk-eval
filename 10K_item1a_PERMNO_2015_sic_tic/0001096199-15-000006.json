Risk Factors\nCURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS IN GEEKNET SECURITIES SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. THESE RISKS HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL EVENTS, TRENDS, OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CONSEQUENTLY THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF ALL OF THE RISKS WE FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS OF WHICH WE ARE NOT PRESENTLY AWARE OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE ARE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BY ANY OF THESE RISKS. ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY US ARE QUALIFIED BY THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nIf the Company fails to launch new and innovative products, the demand for our products may be limited and our revenue will be adversely affected.\nIn order to attract customers, we must continually release new and innovative products, including signature products internally developed by GeekLabs. In addition to the direct revenue we derive from product sales, the release of new and innovative products attracts media coverage and drives customers to our business. The successful development, sourcing, manufacturing and merchandising of products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including certain factors specific to our business over which we have limited or no control.\nThere can be no assurance that our new products will appeal to customers or that demand for these products will be sufficient to generate revenue consistent with our estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that new products will be developed in a timely or cost-effective manner, or that we will be able to procure appropriate quantities of such products. Furthermore, if we are unable to deliver new and innovative products that allow us to increase demand, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to grow our business. See also additional risks related to competition set forth elsewhere in these Risk Factors.\nOur business is highly seasonal. In addition, we are exposed to significant inventory risks as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and changes in consumer tastes.\nOur business is highly seasonal, with a disproportionate amount of our sales occurring in the fourth quarter which begins on October 1 and ends on December 31. To be successful, we must accurately predict our customers' tastes and demands to avoid purchasing too much or not enough inventory. If we purchase too much inventory, we may be required to discount those products or write-off products we are unable to sell, reducing our gross margins. If we do not purchase enough inventory, we may fail to meet customer demand and lose potential orders, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, when we launch a new product, it is difficult to accurately forecast customer demand. Certain products, especially custom-manufactured products or products purchased from outside the United States may require significant lead-time, payment or partial payment prior to shipment, and are often not returnable. We carry a broad selection of products and significant inventory levels of certain products and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons. Failure to properly assess our inventory needs could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are highly dependent upon a single third-party fulfillment and warehouse provider and its systems. Any decrease in the quality of service offered by our fulfillment and warehouse provider will adversely affect our reputation and the growth of our business. If we fail to realize anticipated operating efficiencies at our third-party fulfillment and warehouse provider, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to receive inbound inventory and ship completed orders efficiently and in a timely manner to our customers is substantially dependent on not only a single third-party fulfillment and warehouse provider (\"3PL\") but also the 3PL's systems. We ship products to customers worldwide predominantly using the services of our 3PL.\nIf our 3PL fails to meet our distribution and fulfillment needs, our relationship with and reputation among our customers will suffer and this will adversely affect our revenue. Additionally, if our 3PL is unable to meet our distribution and fulfillment needs, particularly during the holiday season, or our contract with our 3PL is terminated, we may be required to secure a second-source or replacement fulfillment and warehouse provider. If we fail to secure, or are unable to secure, a fulfillment and warehouse provider on comparable terms, our reputation and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not continually enhance our website and mobile platform and order processing systems or respond to rapid technological changes, we could lose customers and our net revenues could decline.\nIf we are unable to continually upgrade our website and our mobile platform in a timely manner to accommodate higher volumes of traffic, our website performance could suffer and we may lose customers. In addition, if we are unable to expand the computer systems that we use to process and ship customer orders and process customer payments, we may not be able to fulfill any potential growth in customer orders from the website successfully. As a result, we could lose customers and our net revenues could decline. Further, to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our website. The Internet and the online commerce industry are subject to rapid technological change. If competitors introduce new features and website enhancements, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing website and systems may become obsolete or unattractive. Developing and enhancing our website and other systems entails significant technical and business risks. We may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our website, our transaction processing systems and our computer network to meet customer requirements or emerging industry standards. If we are unsuccessful in upgrading our systems to accommodate higher traffic or developing or implementing new technologies that enable us to meet evolving industry standards and remain competitive, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not successfully and cost-effectively implement one or more of these intended upgrades or modified processes or if we do not achieve desired efficiencies or cost savings as a result of these changes or if attempts to enhance our website are unsuccessful or are not appealing to our customers, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nUnplanned system interruptions and capacity constraints could harm our revenue and reputation.\nOur business is dependent on the uninterrupted and highly-available operation of our website. We experience periodic service interruptions with our website. Service interruptions may be caused by a variety of factors, including\ncapacity constraints, software design flaws and bugs, and third party denial of service attacks. If we fail to provide customers with such access to our website at the speed and performance at which they require even during the high traffic peak seasons, our sales and business reputation could be adversely affected.\nOur systems and operations remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure and similar events. If we do not invest further in our infrastructure or if our website experiences frequent or lengthy service interruptions, our business and reputation could be adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely affected by data loss or other security breaches.\nThe nature of our business involves the use of our proprietary information as well as the storage and transmission of customers' personally identifiable and proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, enforcement actions and damage of our reputation. While we take measures to protect personally identifiable information from unauthorized access or disclosure, it is possible that our security controls over personally identifiable information may not prevent improper access or disclosure. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. As a result, an unauthorized party may be able to disrupt our operations or obtain access to our data or our customers' personally identifiable information or proprietary data. Due to the nature of sophisticated cyber-attacks, there is a risk that such attack may remain undetected for a period of time.\nA cyber-attack, such as a denial of service attack, that renders our site inoperable could result in adverse consequences, including significant loss of revenues. Any security breach may also cause us to expend significant resources to restore system functionality and incur costs to deploy additional personnel, protection technologies and third party consultants to defend against a future security breach. We outsource the operation of our network connectivity and work actively to maintain up-to-date security and defense measures. If any of our outsourcing providers does not perform adequately, we may be exposed to greater risk of a cyber-attack.\nFurthermore, concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information, or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. We periodically review our security and privacy practices and we are continuing to implement and update policies and practices as a result of these reviews. We may not adequately identify risks and the policies and practices we implement may not be effective.\nWe are reliant on foreign sources of production for certain products.\nIn order to offer cost-effective and innovative products, we rely on manufacturers located outside of the United States, most of which are located in China, to supply us with sufficient quantities of these products based on our forecasts and to deliver these products in a timely manner.\nOur arrangements with these manufacturers are generally limited to purchase orders tied to specific lots of goods. We are subject to the risks of relying on products manufactured outside of the United States, including political unrest, trade restrictions, customs and import/export regulations, local business practice and geo-political issues, such as political and social unrest and economic instability. Additionally, significant reliance on foreign sources of production increases the risks relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards, customs and import/export laws and regulations, compliance with domestic or international manufacturing and product safety standards, currency fluctuations, restrictions on the transfer of funds, work stoppages or slowdowns and other labor issues, economic uncertainties including inflation and government regulations, availability and costs of raw materials, potentially adverse tax consequences and other uncertainties.\nChina has experienced rapid social, political and economic changes and further changes may adversely affect our ability to procure our products from Chinese suppliers. Our ability to obtain goods on a cost effective basis is also subject to our ability to maintain relationships with our suppliers and our ability to negotiate and maintain supply arrangements on favorable terms. The Chinese Yuan (\u201cCNY\u201d) exchange rate to the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) has not historically been volatile. In the event that the CNY/USD exchange rate changes substantially, our suppliers could\nattempt to renegotiate our purchase orders with them, which could increase our costs. In addition, because our purchases are usually on a case by case basis, we are subject to the risk of unexpected changes in pricing or supply from these suppliers. We may also be unable to develop beneficial relationships with new vendors in the future.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims if people or property is harmed by the products we sell, which could be costly to defend and subject us to significant damage claims.\nSome of the products we offer for sale may expose us to product liability or product safety claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by such products and may require us to take actions such as product recalls, which could involve significant expense incurred by the Company. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. The successful assertion of an uninsured product liability or other claim against us could cause us to incur significant expenses to pay such a claim and could adversely affect our financial results. Even a successfully defended product liability claim could cause us to incur significant expenses to defend and could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, some of our vendor agreements with our suppliers do not indemnify us from product liability and even if some agreements provide for indemnification, it may not be possible or practical to avail ourselves of the benefits of the protection.\nWe may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year, could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.\nAs a seller of consumer products, we are subject to various statutory, regulatory, and legal developments that may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAs an Internet retailer of consumer products, we are subject to significant federal, state, and local laws of the United States, as well as of the European Union and other international markets. We are taking steps we believe are necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance.\nThe impact of complying with new or changing statutes and regulations could impose increased costs on our business and affect how we operate or execute our strategies. Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations, and could have a negative impact on our future results of operations.\nIncreased focus on sales and use tax could subject us to liability for past sales and cause our future sales to decrease.\nWe currently collect sales taxes for merchandise shipped to Colorado, Ohio, Virginia, and Washington, but we do not collect sales or other taxes on shipments of our goods into the remaining states in the United States or internationally. The relocation of our fulfillment center or customer service centers or any future expansion of them, along with other aspects of our business, may result in additional sales and other tax obligations. We do not collect consumption tax (including value added tax, goods and services tax, and provincial sales tax) as applicable on goods and services sold that are delivered outside of the United States as our terms of sale provide that the customer is responsible for such expenses. One or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on out-of-jurisdiction e-commerce companies. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers, and otherwise harm our business.\nCurrently, U.S. Supreme Court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the Internet. However, a number of states and the U.S. Congress continue to consider initiatives that could limit or supersede the Supreme Court's position regarding sales and use taxes on Internet sales, and some states have adopted laws that attempt to impose obligations on out-of-state retailers to collect taxes on their behalf. If any of these initiatives are successful, we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in additional states. The imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon Internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on all of our online competitors, and could result in a decrease of our future sales.\nFailure to effectively manage and integrate acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.\nPart of our growth strategy is to evaluate and pursue selected acquisition and expansion opportunities. The Company completed an acquisition this year, and may look to acquire additional companies in the future. This acquisition and any future acquisitions and the successful integration of assets and businesses into our own as well as the retention of personnel require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could negatively impact our business operations. We may encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting and challenges of transitioning legacy information technology systems in connection with the integration of an acquired company. We may be unable to successfully integrate the business we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures and therefore may not be able to realize the anticipated return on invested capital. If we fail to integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and operating results could suffer materially. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to impairment of the associated goodwill and intangible asset balances.\nCompetition in the e-commerce retail industry is intense. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur business is rapidly evolving and operates in an intensely competitive industry. We have many competitors, including other e-commerce businesses as well as traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Increases in shipping costs or the taxation of Internet commerce may make our products less competitive when compared with traditional brick- and-mortar retailers. Additionally, our current and future competitors may have greater resources, more customers and greater brand recognition than we do. These competitors may secure better terms from vendors and adopt more competitive pricing for their products. They may also devote more resources to their technology infrastructure, product development, order fulfillment, distribution facilities and marketing and advertising campaigns. In addition, as we expand into new markets and broaden our product offering, our competition may intensify as our current and future competitors enter into similar markets and offer similar products. Local competitors in these new markets may have substantial competitive advantages because of greater focus on and knowledge of local customers and their preferences and greater brand recognition. Further, if we fail to maintain a customer loyalty program that is competitive in our industry, we may not attract or retain customers, and our sales may suffer.\nIncreased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations. We expect competition to intensify in the future because current and new competitors can enter our market with little difficulty and can launch new websites at a relatively low cost.\nWe are vulnerable to claims that our website and software infringe third-party intellectual property rights. Any resulting claims against us could be costly to defend or subject us to significant damages.\nWe expect that our website will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of web properties in different Internet industry segments overlap. The scope of United States patent protection for software is not well-defined and will evolve as the United States Patent and Trademark Office grants additional patents. Because patent applications in the United States are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, applications may have been filed that would relate to our products. We may also receive patent infringement claims as companies increasingly seek to patent their software. Our developers may unknowingly infringe on third-party patent rights. We cannot prevent current or future patent holders or other owners of intellectual property from suing us and others seeking monetary damages or an injunction against our web offerings. We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. We might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses. Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products. In either event, our operating results could be adversely affected. In recent years, companies have also been subject to patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities, or \"patent trolls.\" In addition, employees hired from competitors might utilize proprietary and trade secret information from their former employers without our knowledge, even though our employment agreements and policies clearly prohibit such practices.\nAny litigation regarding our intellectual property, with or without merit, could be costly and time consuming to defend, divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and cause interruption to our website. Claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements\nthat may not be available on acceptable terms. In addition, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to offer our products in the United States and abroad and could result in an award of substantial damages against us. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any required license could delay release of our products and increase our costs. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be immediately and materially adversely affected.\nOur Company\u2019s success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies.\nOur Company\u2019s success is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate corporate strategies. Our current strategy includes transformational change to many areas of our business, including expanding product development, improving customer website experience and customer service, re-targeting our marketing, controlling costs and improving gross margin. Achieving the goals we have set in a timely manner will be challenging, and it is possible that our strategies may prove to be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in future periods. It is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies, that the strategies we will implement expose us to additional risks or that strategies that have been successful in the past will fail to produce the desired results. Our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to design and execute appropriate strategies. The market value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them.\nRisks Related To Our Financial Results\nWe have a history of losses and may incur net losses in the foreseeable future. If we are unable to attain consistent profitability, the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have an accumulated deficit of $751.7 million as of December 31, 2014. We may continue to incur net losses in the future. If we are unable to attain profitability on a sustained basis, the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation and may be limited further.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). We determined that such an ownership change occurred as of November 2008. This ownership change resulted in limitations on the utilization of tax attributes, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits.\nThe occurrence of an additional ownership change could limit the ability to utilize NOLs that are not currently subject to limitation, and could further limit the ability to utilize NOLs that are currently subject to limitation. The amount of the annual limitation generally is equal to the value of the stock of the corporation immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the adjusted federal tax-exempt rate, set by the Internal Revenue Service. Limitations imposed on the ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nCertain factors specific to our business over which we have limited or no control may nonetheless adversely impact our total revenue and financial results.\nThe primary factors over which we have limited or no control that may adversely impact our total revenue and financial results include the following:\n\u2022\nspecific economic conditions relating to our business\n\u2022\nadoption of new government laws and regulations\n\u2022\nthe spending habits of our customers\n\u2022\nthe performance of our suppliers\n\u2022\nexecution by our third party fulfillment centers\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key personnel.\nIf our revenue and operating results fall below our expectations, the expectations of securities analysts or the expectations of investors, the trading price of our common stock will likely be materially and adversely affected. You should not rely on the results of our business in any past periods as an indication of our future financial performance.\nIf we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our products, revenues and operating results could suffer.\nA material portion of our revenue is derived from sales of products related to popular online or video games, films and television shows. We rely on our ability to acquire rights related to popular online or video games, films and television shows and pay royalties to branded content owners for the use of their content on these products. Competition for these licenses can be intense, and we may not be able to acquire or renew desirable licenses at reasonable rates or at all. In addition, while part of our business strategy involves predicting future trends, we may be unsuccessful in predicting which video games, films, television shows or other pop culture phenomena will be popular in the future and target our license-acquisition activities accordingly. Our failure to maintain our existing licenses or acquire successful new licenses at reasonable rates could significantly impact our content sales or interrupt our supply chain and require use to modify our products or business plans and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur wholesale business is heavily dependent on sales to several large retailers.\nOur wholesale business continued to grow during 2014, primarily as a result of sales to several large retailers. These large retailers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from us at any time for any reason. They could also bring to market products that compete with our successful products. In addition, our wholesale customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us, including demands on product pricing and returns. We have not experienced a material level of product returns to date, but the risk exists. If we lose a significant wholesale customer or if sales of our products to a significant wholesale customer materially decrease, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIncreased shipping costs and labor stoppages may adversely affect sales of our products.\nMany of our products are imported from overseas and delivered to customers from our fulfillment center located in Ohio. We have established relationships with reputable common carriers for the inbound and outbound delivery of these products. If these carriers were to increase the prices they charge to ship our goods, and we pass these increases on to our customers, our customers might choose to buy comparable products locally to avoid shipping charges. In addition, these carriers may experience labor stoppages or other issues such as those being experienced in the West Coast ports, which could impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis to our customers and adversely affect customer relationships.\nChanges to financial accounting standards may affect our results of operations.\nWe prepare our financial statements to conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting standards. A change in an accounting policy can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. Changes to those rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nOther Risks Related To Our Overall Business\nWe are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic slowdowns and related uncertainties.\nWe are subject to macroeconomic fluctuations in the U.S. economy and elsewhere. Concerns about consumer and investor confidence, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending, international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and/or pandemic illness could cause a slowdown in sales revenue in the United States and abroad. Purchases of our products are discretionary. If the economic climate deteriorates, customers or potential customers could delay, reduce or suspend their purchases of our products. There could be a number of follow-on effects from the recent financial crisis on our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; customer insolvencies; counterparty failures; and increased expense or inability to obtain future financing. If weak macroeconomic conditions persist or worsen, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on third parties to provide a number of products and services, subjecting us to significant operational risks.\nWe currently depend on a number of third-party providers, and this reliance subjects us to significant operational risks, any of which could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers should they occur. These risks include:\n\u2022\nreduced management and control of our data, including the risk of unauthorized disclosure of customer and/or other protected information\n\u2022\nreduced control over delivery schedule and quality assurance\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property\n\u2022\nfailures by the third parties on whom we rely to comply with all domestic and foreign laws relating to our business\nWe may encounter difficulties in the implementation or operation of our new enterprise resource planning system.\nWe implemented a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for our Company. We expect that the ERP system will enable us to improve our productivity, stream line processes, make our operations more cost efficient and obtain website, inventory and other financial data timely and accurately. The implementation of the new ERP system has required, and will continue to require, the involvement of significant financial and human resources. The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our ERP system as we rely heavily on this system to manage all aspects of our business, including forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, financial management and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new ERP system or its inability to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business could disrupt our business and adversely affect the Company's business and our financial results.\nIf we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully, our ability to manage our business could be impaired.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain certain key personnel, including management, technical, sales, and other critical personnel. The competition for attracting and retaining key employees is intense. In the Internet and high technology industries, qualified candidates often consider equity awards in compensation arrangements and fluctuations in our stock price may make it difficult to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. The loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, and the results of our operations. In addition, the integration of replacement personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful.\nOur stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the closing sale prices of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market ranged from $7.71 to $19.18 per share and the closing sale price on December 31, 2014, the last trading day of the\nyear, was $8.28 per share. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, all of whom have been granted stock options.\nSales of our common stock by a significant stockholder may cause the price of our common stock to decrease.\nSeveral of our stockholders own significant portions of our common stock. If these stockholders were to sell substantial amounts of their holdings of our common stock, then the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted. The effect of such sales, or of significant portions of our stock being offered or made available for sale, could result in strong downward pressure on our stock price. Investors should be aware that they could experience significant short-term volatility in our stock if such stockholders decide to sell a substantial amount of their holdings of our common stock at once or within a short period of time.", "PERMNO": 87498, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "GKNT"}
