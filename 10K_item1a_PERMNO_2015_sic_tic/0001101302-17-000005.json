{"cik": "1101302", "company": "ENTEGRIS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our common stock.\nAny of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our operations could be affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. Based on current information, we believe that the following list identifies the most significant risk factors that could affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be material, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. For more information, see \u201cCautionary Statement\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to our Business and Industry\nTHE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY CYCLICAL AND INDUSTRY DOWNTURNS COULD REDUCE OUR NET SALES AND PROFITS.\nOur business depends on the purchasing patterns of semiconductor manufacturers, which, in turn, depend on the current and anticipated demand for semiconductors and products utilizing semiconductors. The semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical with periodic significant downturns, which often have resulted in significantly decreased expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers. Even moderate cyclicality can cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from one period to the next. We have in the past experienced significant revenue deterioration and incurred significant operating losses due to a severe downturn in the semiconductor industry. We are unable to predict the ultimate duration and severity of future downturns for the semiconductor industry.\nFurthermore, in periods of reduced demand, we must continue to maintain a satisfactory level of engineering, research and development expenditures, continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain the ability to respond to any significant increases in demand, if they occur. Changes in order patterns have a more immediate impact on our revenues because we typically do not have significant backlog. We expect the semiconductor industry to continue to be cyclical. During downturns our revenue is reduced and there is likely to be an increase in pricing pressure and shifts in product and customer mix, all of which may affect gross margin and net income. Such fluctuations in our results could cause our stock price to decline significantly. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance.\nIn addition, there may not be new high-opportunity applications to drive growth in the semiconductor industry, as was the case in earlier market cycles. Accordingly, the semiconductor industry may experience lower growth rates during any recovery cycle than has historically been the case and its longer-term performance may reflect this lower growth rate.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO MEET DEMAND IN RESPONSE TO THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY\u2019S RAPID DEMAND SHIFTS OR ACCURATELY FORECAST DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN OUR MARKET SHARE AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.\nOur ability to increase sales of our products, particularly our capital equipment products, depends in part upon our ability to ramp up our manufacturing capacity for such products in a timely manner, often in as little as a few months, and to quickly mobilize our supply chain. If we are unable to expand our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or manage such expansion effectively, our customers could seek such products from other suppliers, and our market share could be reduced. Because demand shifts in the semiconductor industry are rapid and difficult to foresee, we may not be able to increase capacity quickly enough to respond to any such increase in demand.\nWe typically operate our business on a just-in-time shipment basis with a modest level of backlog and we order supplies and plan production based on internal forecasts of demand. We have, in the past, and may again in the future, fail to accurately forecast\ndemand for our products, in terms of both volume and product type. This has led to, and may in the future lead to, delays in product shipments, disappointment of customer expectations, or, alternatively, an increased risk of excess inventory and of inventory obsolescence. If we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE OUR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE.\nThe semiconductor industry is subject to rapid technological change, changing customer requirements and frequent new product introductions. As a result, the life cycle of our products is difficult to determine. We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to develop mission-critical solutions to maximize our customers\u2019 manufacturing yields and enable higher performance of end-market materials or devices. This requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes in a cost-effective and timely manner. A failure to develop new products or enhancements to our existing products or the inability to timely manufacture and ship these products or enhancements in sufficient volume could harm our business prospects and significantly reduce our sales. In addition, if new products have reliability or quality problems, we may experience reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance and payment, additional service and warranty expense, and damage to our reputation.\nOUR SALES ARE CONCENTRATED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF KEY CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, OUR NET SALES AND PROFITABILITY MAY MATERIALLY DECLINE IF ONE OR MORE OF OUR KEY CUSTOMERS DOES NOT CONTINUE TO PURCHASE OUR EXISTING AND NEW PRODUCTS.\nWe depend and expect to continue to depend on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our business, and changes in several customers\u2019 orders could have a significant impact on our operating results. Our top ten customers accounted for 45%, 44% and 42% of our net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our net sales and profitability may decline significantly if any one of our key customers decides to purchase significantly less from us or to terminate its relationship with us entirely. We could also lose our key customers or significant sales to our key customers because of factors beyond our control, such as a significant disruption in our customers\u2019 businesses generally or in a specific product line, a change in the manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer inventory adjustments. For example, our SCEM segment customers\u2019 and their customers\u2019 aggressive management of inventory has adversely affected its results of operations in the past and may adversely affect future results of operations. Given the generally fixed nature of our costs, if our customers delay or cancel their orders or reduce ordered quantities from forecasted volumes, we may be required to hold inventory for longer than anticipated, our profitability may be reduced, our ability to fund our operations may be restricted, our revenue may incur unanticipated reductions or be delayed and our gross margins may decline.\nOur customers could stop incorporating our products into their products with limited advance notice to us and suffer little or no penalty for doing so. The semiconductor industry is currently undergoing consolidation, with a number of major firms merging or being acquired. If any of our customers merge or are acquired, we may experience lower overall sales from the merged or surviving companies. Because we develop long-term relationships with key customers in the product areas we serve, and because we have a long product design and development cycle for most new products, which are then subject to lengthy customer product qualification periods, we may be unable to quickly replace these customers, if at all.\nCOMPETITION FROM NEW OR EXISTING COMPANIES COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against many domestic and foreign companies that have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have better-established relationships with our existing customers than we do, which may enable them to have their products specified for use more frequently and more quickly by these customers. We also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers, who continually evaluate the benefits of internal manufacturing versus outsourcing. As more OEMs dispose of their manufacturing operations and increase the outsourcing of their products to liquid and gas delivery system and other component companies, we may face increasing competitive pressures to grow our business and portfolio of products in order to maintain our market share. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and a loss of market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, we expect that existing and new competitors will improve the design of their existing products and will introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics. The introduction of new products or more efficient production of existing products by our competitors could diminish our market share and increase pricing pressure on our products. Further, if we do not respond to pressure from our customers to lower prices, shorten delivery times and enhance product capability, we could lose customers or orders.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FUTURE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCT INITIATIVES AND RELATED CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROJECTS, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY MAY DECLINE.\nIn the semiconductor market, while the development period for a product can be very long, the first company to introduce an innovative product meeting an identified customer need will often have a significant advantage over offerings of competitive products. For this reason, we may make significant cash expenditures to engineer, research, develop and market new products and make significant capital investments in technology and manufacturing capacity in advance of future business developing and without any purchase commitment from our customers. For example, we incurred $107.0 million, $105.9 million and $87.7 million for engineering, research and development expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFollowing development, it may take a number of years for sales of a new product to reach a substantial level, if ever. A product concept may never progress beyond the development stage or may only achieve limited acceptance in the marketplace. If this occurs, we do not receive a direct return on our expenditures, we may not realize any indirect benefits, we may lose market share and our revenue and profitability may decline. For example, while we made significant cash expenditures and capital investments to develop the capability to manufacture shippers and FOUPs for 450 mm wafers, the size and timing of the development of the market for 450 mm wafer shippers and FOUPs remains uncertain. As major semiconductor manufacturers have delayed the implementation of 450 mm manufacturing and others have announced that they would not initiate 450 mm manufacturing until after 2020, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully sell significant quantities of our 450 mm shipper and FOUP products or realize a return on our investment in the near term or ever.\nWE MAY ACQUIRE OTHER BUSINESSES, FORM JOINT VENTURES OR DIVEST BUSINESSES THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY, REQUIRE US TO INCUR DEBT AND DILUTE YOUR OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANY.\nAs part of our business strategy and as we have in the past, we expect to continue to address gaps in our product offerings, diversify into complementary product markets or pursue additional technology and customers through acquisitions, joint ventures or other types of collaborations. We also expect to adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our ongoing strategic objectives. As a result, we may enter markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and may encounter difficulties in divesting businesses that no longer meet our objectives. Competition for acquiring attractive businesses in our industry is substantial. In executing this part of our business strategy, we may experience difficulty in identifying suitable acquisition candidates or in completing selected transactions at appropriate valuations. Alternatively, we may be required to undertake multiple transactions at the same time in order to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that do arise. This could strain our ability to effectively execute and integrate these transactions. We would consider a variety of financing alternatives for each acquisition which could include borrowing funds, reducing our cash balances or issuing additional shares of our common stock to complete an acquisition. This could impair our liquidity and dilute your ownership of the Company. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we do make into our existing business operations, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or experience negative effects on our reported results of operations from dilutive results from operations and/or from future potential impairment of acquired assets, including goodwill, related to future acquisitions. We may experience difficulties in retaining key employees or customers of an acquired business, and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from other business issues. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all, and we may not realize the benefits of any acquisition or joint venture.\nWE MAY NOT EFFECTIVELY PENETRATE NEW MARKETS.\nPart of our business strategy is to leverage our expertise in our core competencies for growth in new and adjacent markets, such as photovoltaic cells, LEDs, flat panel displays, lithium ion batteries, magnetic storage devices and life sciences. Our ability to grow our business could be limited if we are unable to execute on this strategy.\nWE FACE THE RISK OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AND, IN PARTICULAR, CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TRANSPORT TOXIC GASES USED IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND A LEAK COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT HARM AND LIABILITY.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products involve the risk of product liability claims. In addition, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of the customer. For example, while we believe that our SDS and VAC delivery systems are the safest available in the industry, as with any products involved in the transport and storage of toxic gases, if a leak were to occur during transport or during storage at our customers\u2019 location, serious damage could result including injury or death to any person exposed to those toxic gases creating significant product liability for us. There can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to satisfy any such liabilities and our financial results or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nLOSS OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS, WHILE OUR INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN NEW QUALIFIED PERSONNEL COULD INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AND GROW OUR BUSINESS SUCCESSFULLY.\nMany of our key personnel have significant experience in the semiconductor industry and deep technical expertise. The loss of the services of one or several of our key employees or an inability to attract, train and retain qualified and skilled employees, specifically research and development and engineering personnel, could result in the loss of customers or otherwise inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully. In the past, during downturns in the semiconductor industry, we have had to impose salary reductions on senior employees and freeze or eliminate merit increases in an effort to maintain our financial position. These actions may have an adverse effect on employee loyalty and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key personnel.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TECHNOLOGY, IF OUR COMPETITORS WERE TO DEVELOP SIMILAR OR SUPERIOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR TECHNOLOGY, OR, IF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR TECHNOLOGY VIOLATE THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS COULD BE HARMED.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in our principal product families. We rely, in part, on patent, trade secret and trademark law to protect that technology. We have obtained a number of patents relating to our products and have filed applications for additional patents. We cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will be approved, in key jurisdictions or at all, that we will develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable, that any patents owned by or issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or that these patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised by third parties. In addition, if we do not obtain intellectual property protection in the international jurisdictions we serve, our competitiveness in these markets could be significantly impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue. While we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with third parties to protect our proprietary information and technology, these agreements may not be enforceable or they may be breached by such employees or third parties, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches. Furthermore, our confidential and proprietary information and technology could be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties and third parties could design around our patents.\nCompetitors may misappropriate our intellectual property, and disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise. We may institute litigation in order to enforce our patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights. For example, in January 2011, we settled multiple patent litigations with Pall Corporation (which was acquired by Danaher Corporation in 2015). We prosecuted and defended these cases vigorously and incurred substantial costs in pursuing them. It may become necessary for us to initiate other costly patent litigation against our competitors in order to protect and/or perfect our intellectual property rights. We cannot predict how any existing or future litigation will be resolved or what its impact will be on us.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating any patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties. If we are found to infringe or misappropriate a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights, we could be required to pay damages to such third party, alter our products or processes, obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing such proprietary rights, including making or selling products utilizing such proprietary rights. If we are required to obtain a license from a third party, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially favorable terms, if at all.\nOUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE OR NATURAL CATASTROPHES IN THE LOCATIONS IN WHICH WE, OUR CUSTOMERS OR OUR SUPPLIERS OPERATE, SUCH AS THE MARCH 2011 EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN AND THE JUNE 2012 WILDFIRES IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO.\nWe have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural events such as severe weather and earthquakes that could disrupt operations. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 operations, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Also, climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our businesses. While the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan did not materially impair manufacturing operations at our Yonezawa, Japan plant and while the June 2012 wildfires did not materially impair manufacturing operations at our Colorado Springs plant, there can be no assurance that future such catastrophes will not impact our manufacturing operations or those of our supply chain partners by disrupting our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, NETWORK DISRUPTIONS AND BREACHES IN DATA SECURITY.\nInformation technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security from cyber-attacks, employee social media use on our computers or through failure of our internet service providers and other cloud computing service providers to\nsuccessfully secure their own systems could disrupt our operations, cause customer communication and order management issues, cause the unintentional disclosure of customer, employee and proprietary information, and cause disruption in our transaction processing, which could affect our reputation and reporting of financial results. While our management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security, hiring personnel and establishing internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL HEALTH AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING IN THE FUTURE, REACT TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND MAKE PAYMENTS ON THE INDEBTEDNESS.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have an aggregate principal amount of approximately $594 million of outstanding total indebtedness, comprised of our 6% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2022 (\u201cNotes\u201d) and our senior secured term loan facility due 2021 (\u201cTerm Loan\u201d). In addition, we have approximately $75 million of unutilized capacity under a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (\u201cABL Facility\u201d), which is subject to a borrowing base.\nOur high level of debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the Term Loan and the ABL Facility;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under the Term Loan and the ABL Facility include variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\npreventing us from raising funds necessary to repurchase all Notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of certain changes of control, which could constitute a default under the indenture governing the Notes;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the indenture that governs the Notes and the credit agreements governing our Term Loan and our ABL Facility contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our debt.\nDESPITE OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS, WE MAY STILL BE ABLE TO INCUR SUBSTANTIALLY MORE DEBT, WHICH COULD FURTHER EXACERBATE THE RISKS TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION DESCRIBED ABOVE AND PREVENT US FROM FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indenture that governs the Notes and the credit agreements governing our Term Loan and our ABL Facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, such as indebtedness to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. For example, our Term Loan provides that we have the right to request additional loans and commitments, and to the extent that the aggregate amount of such additional loans and commitments exceeds $225 million, the incurrence thereof will be subject to our secured net leverage ratio being less than a specified ratio, or in the case of unsecured loans or other unsecured debt, or loans or other debt secured by junior liens, our total net leverage ratio being less than a specified ratio. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the Notes, subject to collateral arrangements, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the Notes and the lenders under the Term Loan and the ABL Facility in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our Company. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could intensify.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND MAY BE FORCED TO TAKE OTHER ACTIONS, WHICH MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL, TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR INDEBTEDNESS.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets, which are subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions, as well as certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems, be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, and our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions is restricted by the agreements governing our indebtedness and we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Term Loan and the ABL Facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nTHE TERMS OF OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR TERM LOAN AND OUR ABL FACILITY AND THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES RESTRICT OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGES OR TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS.\nThe credit agreements governing our Term Loan and our ABL Facility and the indenture that governs the Notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur certain liens;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nalter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our ABL Facility may, at certain times, require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of some or all of our indebtedness, which could lead to bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency.\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our plans and could adversely affect our ability to:\n\u2022\nfinance our operations;\n\u2022\nmake needed capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nmake strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into joint ventures;\n\u2022\nwithstand a future downturn in our business, the industry or the economy in general;\n\u2022\ncompete effectively and engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our best interest; and\n\u2022\nplan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nA LOWERING OR WITHDRAWAL OF THE RATINGS ASSIGNED TO OUR DEBT SECURITIES BY RATING AGENCIES MAY INCREASE OUR FUTURE BORROWING COSTS AND REDUCE OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL.\nThe Notes have been rated by Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s. There is no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time. Rating agencies also may lower, suspend or withdraw ratings on the Notes or our other debt in the\nfuture. Any lowering, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market prices or marketability of our indebtedness and make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\nManufacturing Risks\nOUR DEPENDENCE ON SINGLE AND LIMITED SOURCE SUPPLIERS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS.\nWe rely on single or limited source suppliers for some plastic polymers, filtration membranes, petroleum coke and certain other materials, such as chemicals and gases, which are critical to the manufacturing of our products. At times, we have experienced a limited supply of certain raw material polymers as well as the need to substitute polymers, resulting in delays, increased costs and risks associated with qualifying products made from such new polymers with our customers. An industry-wide increase in demand for these polymers or the discontinuation of such polymers could affect our ability to acquire sufficient quantities. If we are unable to obtain an adequate quantity of such supplies, our manufacturing operations may be interrupted. Obtaining alternative sources would likely result in increased costs and shipping delays, which could decrease profitability and damage our relationships with current and potential customers.\nPrices for polymers can vary widely. In a volatile oil price environment, some suppliers have added and may in the future add surcharges to the prices of the polymers we purchase. While we have long-term arrangements with certain key suppliers of polymers that fix our price for purchases up to specified quantities, if our polymer requirements exceed the quantities specified, we could be exposed to higher material costs. If the cost of polymers increases and we are unable to correspondingly increase the sales price of our products, our profit margins will decline.\nOur filtration products incorporate a wide variety of filter membranes designed to meet specific customer filtration needs, not all of which are produced internally. In the event that a manufacturer of outsourced membrane discontinues supply or production, we may be required to identify and qualify an alternative filter membrane for that application to incorporate into our products. This could require extensive lead times and increased costs which may cause us to lose sales and cause our profit margins to decline.\nOur graphite synthesis process requires petroleum coke that meets specified criteria. While there are multiple suppliers for this petroleum coke, the sources are limited and our required criteria may cause the price of this petroleum coke to increase.\nThe unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources we use for our SCEM segment products may require us to reduce production of these products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of these materials or resources. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, AND OUR PRODUCTION COULD BE DISRUPTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO AVOID MANUFACTURING DIFFICULTIES.\nOur manufacturing processes are complex and require the use of expensive and technologically sophisticated equipment and materials. These processes are frequently modified to improve manufacturing yields and product quality. We have, on occasion, experienced manufacturing difficulties, such as occasional critical equipment breakdowns and the introduction of impurities in the manufacturing process, which cause lower manufacturing yields, make our products unmarketable and/or delay deliveries to customers. A number of our product lines are manufactured at only one or two facilities in different countries, and any disruption could impact our sales until another facility could commence or expand production of such products. We could experience these or other manufacturing difficulties, which might result in a loss of customers and exposure to warranty and product liability claims.\nWE MAY LOSE SALES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY PROCURE, REPAIR OR REPLACE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO MANUFACTURE MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS.\nIf our existing equipment fails, or we are unable to obtain new equipment quickly enough to satisfy any increased demand for our products, we may lose sales to competitors. In particular, we do not maintain duplicate tools or equipment for most of our important products. Fixing or replacing complex tools is time consuming, and we may not be able to replace a damaged tool in time to meet customer requirements. In addition, from time to time we may upgrade or add new manufacturing equipment that may require substantial lead times to build and qualify. Delays in building and qualifying new equipment could result in a disruption of our manufacturing processes and prevent us from meeting our customers\u2019 requirements, which could lead our customers to seek seek other suppliers.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THAT COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.\nFailure to comply with the wide variety of federal, state, local and non-U.S. regulatory requirements affecting our business relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation, of, and human exposure to, hazardous chemicals, which have tended to become stricter over time, could result in future liabilities or the suspension of production. For example, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act modified the Toxic Control Substances Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d) by requiring Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to prioritize and evaluate the environmental and health risks of existing\nchemicals and providing EPA with greater authority to regulate chemicals posing unreasonable risks. According to this statute, EPA is required to make an affirmative finding that a new chemical will not pose an unreasonable risk before such chemical can go into production. As a result, TSCA has been updated so that it operates in a similar fashion to the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d) legislation in Europe. Regulations similar to REACH have been enacted in South Korea and Taiwan. Any such changes to these and similar regulations promulgated by other countries could increase our cost of doing business and have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, the nature of our business exposes us to risk of liability for environmental contamination if hazardous materials are released into the environment, which could result in substantial losses, reputational harm, increase in our insurance cost or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, compliance with present or future laws could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or to build or acquire new facilities or require us to acquire costly control equipment, incur other significant expenses, such as costs of remediation of contamination found on any site that we may acquire, or to modify our manufacturing processes.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS COULD BE DISRUPTED AND OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\nIn order to enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our manufacturing operations, and to better serve customers located in various countries, as we have in the past, we may in the future move several product lines from one of our plants to another and consolidate manufacturing operations in certain of our plants. If we are unable to establish stable processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in relocated manufacturing processes in the destination plant, production may be disrupted and we may not be able to deliver these products to meet customer orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose credibility with our customers and harm our business. Even if we successfully move our manufacturing processes, there is no assurance that the cost savings and efficiencies we anticipate will be achieved.\nInternational Risks\nWE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SALES AND MANUFACTURING ACTIVITY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH SUBJECTS US TO ADDITIONAL BUSINESS RISKS AND MAY CAUSE OUR PROFITABILITY TO DECLINE DUE TO INCREASED COSTS.\nSales to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 78%, 77% and 75% of our net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a majority of our net sales. In addition, a number of our key domestic customers derive a significant portion of their revenues from sales in international markets. We also manufacture a significant portion of our products outside the United States and are dependent on international suppliers for many of our parts and raw materials. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in both sales and manufacturing internationally. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks and potential costs that could adversely affect our revenue and profitability, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements that could impose additional costs on our operations or limit our ability to operate our business;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in collecting our accounts receivable and longer payment cycles than are typical in domestic operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nexpense and complexity of complying with U.S. and foreign import and export regulations;\n\u2022\nliability for foreign taxes assessed at rates higher than those applicable to our domestic operations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated government actions, such as trade wars; and\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability.\nIn the past, we have incurred costs or experienced disruptions due to the factors described above and we expect to do so in the future. For example, our operations in Asia, and particularly South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, have been negatively impacted in the past as a result of regional economic instability. In addition, Taiwan and South Korea account for a growing portion of the world\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing. There have historically been strained relations between China and Taiwan and there are continuing tensions between North Korea and other countries, including South Korea and the United States. Any adverse developments in those relations could significantly disrupt the worldwide production of semiconductors, which may lead to reduced sales of our products. Furthermore, we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the United States. In a number of foreign countries, some companies engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. law applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary or common, will not take actions in violation of our\npolicies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWE WILL LOSE SALES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO EXPORT CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR TO IMPORT CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS INTO FOREIGN MARKETS, AND WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES IF WE DO NOT COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE EXPORT AND IMPORT CONTROL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.\nExports of certain of our products are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. Government and administered by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. Certain of our products are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) administered by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, which requires a license depending on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user and whether a license exception might apply and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) administered by the Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, for which a license is often required. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the prohibition of our ability to export altogether, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nProducts developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to export controls of the applicable foreign nation. Obtaining export licenses can be difficult, time-consuming and costly. Failure to obtain export licenses could significantly reduce our revenue and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position.\nIn addition, certain countries require import and other special licenses in order for certain of our products to be imported into or sold in that country. Our inability to satisfy these requirements in a timely manner has in the past prevented, and may continue to prevent us from meeting our customers\u2019 expectations in these countries and to lose sales. For example, in response to recent explosions at gas storage facilities in Singapore and China, the import of gas canisters and chemicals viewed as dangerous have come under increased regulatory scrutiny by governmental officials. This increased regulation may impair the ability of our SCEM segment to import those products into Singapore and China and may cause us to lose sales.\nCHANGES IN TAXATION OR ADVERSE TAX RULINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe have facilities in many foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to taxation at various rates and audit by a number of taxing authorities. Our results of operations could be affected by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate, changes in laws and regulations governing calculation and location of earned profit and taxation thereof, changes in laws and regulations affecting our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet and changes in laws and regulations relating to the repatriation of cash into the United States. Each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability may change.\nWe have undertaken a number of complex internal reorganizations of our foreign subsidiaries in order to rationalize and streamline our foreign operations, focus our management efforts on certain local opportunities and take advantage of favorable business conditions in certain localities. While we have exercised diligence in undertaking this internal reorganization, there can be no assurance that this reorganization, or any future internal reorganization, will not result in adverse tax consequences in the United States or in foreign countries in which we have operations. This could adversely impact our profitability from foreign operations and result in a material reduction in our results of operations.\nAs we purchase raw materials and components from foreign countries in an effort to reduce the cost of our products or to obtain the highest quality materials, our products manufactured from these materials and components may be burdened by import taxes and duties, and these additional costs may put our products at a competitive disadvantage.\nFLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO OTHER CURRENCIES MAY LEAD TO LOWER NET INCOME AND SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY OR MAY CAUSE US TO RAISE PRICES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN REDUCED NET SALES.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity. Foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to foreign currency fluctuations, our profitability could decline. In addition, sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold, and the currency we receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt versus the time of sale as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nVOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS.\nFinancial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent years, including, among other things, volatility in securities prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of\nsovereign debt, declining valuation of certain investments, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, volatility in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. In the past such conditions have had a significant adverse impact on our industry, our financial condition and results of operations. There may be further changes in the global economy, which could lead to further challenges in our business and negatively impact our financial results. For example, the U.K. vote in favor of leaving the European Union may cause instability in European economies and may negatively impact the outlook for the global economy. Tightness of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders and spending for our products and services. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of any disruption in European or global financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects they may have on our business and financial condition. If uncertain economic conditions return or deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be further materially and adversely affected.\nTERRORIST ATTACKS, SUCH AS THE ATTACKS THAT OCCURRED IN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON, D.C. ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AND OTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR WAR MAY AFFECT THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE OR OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS AND OUR PROFITABILITY.\nTerrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and any security we issue. There can be no assurance that there will not be future terrorist attacks against the United States or U.S. businesses. These attacks or other armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Our primary facilities include headquarters, research and development and manufacturing facilities in the United States; sales, research and development and manufacturing facilities in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia; and sales and service facilities in Europe and Asia. Attacks may also disrupt the global insurance and reinsurance industries with the result that we may not be able to obtain insurance at historical terms and levels for our facilities. Furthermore, such attacks may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and may ultimately affect the sales of our products in the United States and overseas. As a result of terrorism, the United States may enter into additional armed conflicts, which could have a further impact on our domestic and international sales, our supply chain, our production capacity and our ability to deliver products to our customers. The consequences of these armed conflicts and the associated instability are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business and any security we issue.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock\nTHE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN VOLATILE IN THE PAST AND MAY BE VOLATILE IN THE FUTURE.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future. In 2016, the closing price of our stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) ranged from a low of $10.60 to a high of $18.55, and, as in past years, the price of our common stock may show greater volatility.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to significant volatility in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control or may be unrelated to our operating results, and which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including the following: the failure to meet the published expectations of securities analysts; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; press releases or announcements by, or changes in market values of, comparable companies; volatility in the markets for high-technology stocks, general stock market price and volume fluctuations, which are particularly common among securities of high-technology companies; stock market price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels; the public perception of equity values of publicly traded companies and the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. Future decreases in our stock price may adversely impact our ability to raise sufficient additional capital in the future, if needed.\nIF OUR COMMON STOCK TRADES BELOW BOOK VALUE OR OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK ERODES, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT LOSSES FOR OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES.\nIn accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we review our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, the asset will be written down to its fair value. The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the primary asset of the group, and long-range forecasts of revenue, reflecting management\u2019s assessment of general economic and industry conditions, operating income, depreciation and amortization and working capital requirements.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these assumptions and estimates, actual results could differ from our estimates and the conclusion that an asset group\u2019s carrying value is recoverable, or that an asset is impaired, including the extent of the\nimpairment, may not be accurate. Due to the uncertain economic environment within the semiconductor industry, we continually monitor circumstances and events to determine whether asset impairment testing is warranted.\nIt is possible that in the future we may no longer be able to conclude that there is no impairment of our long-lived assets, nor that we can we provide assurance that material impairment charges of long-lived assets will not occur in future periods.\nOUR ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF RAPID DEMAND SHIFTS AND OUR MODEST LEVEL OF BACKLOG, AND IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.\nOur sales and profitability can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Because our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short-term, an unanticipated decline in revenue in a particular quarter could significantly reduce our net income, or lead to a net loss, in that quarter. In addition, we make a substantial portion of our shipments shortly after we receive the order, and therefore we operate with a relatively modest level of backlog. As a consequence of the just-in-time nature of shipments and the modest level of backlog, our results of operations may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products. We anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future. Such fluctuations in our results could cause us to fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance.\nIF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. AS A RESULT, CURRENT AND POTENTIAL STOCKHOLDERS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING, WHICH WOULD HARM THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR STOCK.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future identify, material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting, which represent a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not have been prevented or detected. If we fail to implement and maintain our controls over our financial reporting, or encounter difficulties implementing improvements in our controls, we may not meet our reporting obligations. Any failure in our internal controls that leads to a material weakness could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.\nCHANGES IN THE SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE IN THE PAST INCREASED OUR COSTS AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as related rules and listing standards promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ, effected, at least in part, in response to the turmoil over the past several years in the securities and credit markets, as well as the global economy, required changes in some of our corporate governance, securities disclosure and compliance practices. Compliance with these rules and listing standards has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs, and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely. While these costs are no longer increasing, they may increase in the future.\nPROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW MAY DELAY OR PREVENT AN ACQUISITION OF US, WHICH COULD DECREASE THE VALUE OF YOUR SHARES.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation makes us subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations to which it applies from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could discourage others from bidding for our shares of common stock and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in the price of our common stock that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Our issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Our issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution\nto the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.\nYOUR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP IN US MAY BE DILUTED BY FUTURE ISSUANCES OF CAPITAL STOCK, WHICH COULD REDUCE YOUR INFLUENCE OVER MATTERS ON WHICH STOCKHOLDERS VOTE.\nSubject to applicable NASDAQ standards, our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares. Issuances of common stock or the exercise of employee and director stock options would dilute your percentage ownership interest, which will have the effect of reducing your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote. In addition, we may issue substantial quantities of our common stock in order to effect acquisitions which would also dilute your ownership interest. If the issuances are made at prices that reflect a discount from the then current trading price of our common stock, your interest in the book value of our common stock might be diluted.", "PERMNO": 88439, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ENTG"}
