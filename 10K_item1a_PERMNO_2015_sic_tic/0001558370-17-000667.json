{"cik": "1606745", "company": "Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFactors Relating to Our Corporate History and Structure\nWe are a holding company, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.\nOur ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments, including to make debt service payments under the Margin Loan Agreements (as defined below) and any other credit facilities that we may obtain in the future, depends upon our ability to access cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our wholly owned subsidiary BuySeasons, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. We currently have no plans with respect to any asset sales. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject.\nWe do not have access to the cash that TripAdvisor generates from its operating activities.\nTripAdvisor generated $321 million, $418 million and $407 million of cash from its operations during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. TripAdvisor uses the cash it generates from its operations to fund its investing activities and to service its debt and other financing obligations. We do not have access to the cash that TripAdvisor generates unless TripAdvisor declares a dividend on its capital stock payable in cash, repurchases any or all of its outstanding shares of capital stock for cash or otherwise distributes or makes payments to its stockholders, including us. Historically, TripAdvisor has not paid any dividends on its capital stock or, with limited exceptions, otherwise distributed cash to its stockholders and instead has used all of its available cash in the expansion of its business and to service its debt obligations. Covenants in TripAdvisor\u2019s existing debt instruments also restrict the payment of dividends and cash distributions to stockholders. We expect that TripAdvisor will continue to apply its available cash to the expansion of its business.\nOur company may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nIn connection with the TripCo Spin-Off, we have outstanding borrowings of $203 million (the \u201cMargin Loans\u201d) at December 31, 2016, including paid in kind interest, under two margin loan agreements (the \u201cMargin Loan Agreements\u201d) entered into by our bankruptcy remote wholly-owned subsidiary (\u201cTripSPV\u201d). Borrowings under the Margin Loan Agreements are guaranteed solely by our company and secured by our ownership interest in TripAdvisor. In addition, we have outstanding borrowings of $261 million at December 31, 2016, including paid in kind interest, against a variable postpaid forward. All of our equity interests in TripAdvisor are and will be held through TripSPV. Because our primary asset consists of our equity interests in TripAdvisor and the Margin Loan Agreements prohibit, with limited exceptions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness by TripSPV, our company is very limited in its ability to incur additional financing (other than a contingent line of credit provided to our company by Liberty, pursuant to which our company is able to borrow up to $200 million under limited circumstances (the \u201cLiberty Line of Credit\u201d) (which expires in August 2017), and our cash reserves and limited operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations. In addition, the Margin Loan Agreements provide that, among other triggering events, if at any time the closing price per share of TripAdvisor common stock falls below certain minimum values, a partial repayment of the Margin Loans will be due and payable with respect to each such circumstance, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If the company or\nI-11\nTripSPV is unable to pay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the pledged stock of TripAdvisor that TripSPV holds and any other collateral that then secures TripSPV\u2019s obligations under the Margin Loan Agreements, which would materially adversely affect our asset composition and financial condition as well as our access to capital on a going forward basis.\nIn addition, the availability of capital for our company will be subject to prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, all of which are beyond the control of our company. In light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable terms, if at all, to fund investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments. If financing is not available when needed or is not available on favorable terms, our company may be unable to complete acquisitions, repurchase equity or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of our company. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution.\nOur company has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAs discussed above, in connection with the TripCo Spin-Off, we entered into the Margin Loan Agreements as the guarantor with TripSPV as the borrower, pursuant to which TripSPV has outstanding $203 million at December 31, 2016, including paid in kind interest. In addition, we have outstanding borrowings of $261 million at December 31, 2016, including paid in kind interest, against a variable postpaid forward. As a result of this significant indebtedness, our company may:\n\u00b7\nExperience increased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nBe required to dedicate a substantial portion of its available cash to make payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes (and we further note that, in the case of our company, we have a limited amount of cash and do not have access to the cash of TripAdvisor as a result of the significant non-controlling interest in TripAdvisor);\n\u00b7\nBe handicapped in its ability to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for its businesses;\n\u00b7\nBe limited in its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its businesses and the markets in which it operates;\n\u00b7\nPossibly be placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;\n\u00b7\nBe exposed to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any variable rate portion of its indebtedness; and\n\u00b7\nBe limited in its ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms that it finds acceptable.\nIn addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. However, there is no assurance that additional financing will be available to our company on terms favorable to us, if at all. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. In addition, TripSPV is prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness under the Margin Loan Agreements, and we expect our company to have limited capacity to incur indebtedness outside of TripSPV (other than with respect to the Liberty Line of Credit, which is only available under limited circumstances).\nAlthough TripAdvisor has substantial cash flow from operations, we have limited sources of cash and liquidity. Our cash balance is expected to enable us to fund our parent level operating expenses and debt service obligations for the foreseeable future; however, we cannot assure you that we will not experience unexpected expenses or that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and service our direct debt obligations during the foreseeable future. For\nI-12\nadditional information about our company\u2019s ability to potentially service our direct debt obligations, see \u201cWe are a holding company, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.\u201d and \u201cWe do not have access to the cash that TripAdvisor generates from its operating activities.\u201d above.\nThe Margin Loan Agreements contain various covenants that will restrict the activities of TripSPV.\nAs discussed above, in connection with the TripCo Spin-Off, we entered into the Margin Loan Agreements as the guarantor with TripSPV as the borrower, pursuant to which we had outstanding borrowings of $203 million, including paid in kind interest at December 31, 2016. The Margin Loan Agreements contain various covenants, including those that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nIncur indebtedness by TripSPV;\n\u00b7\nEnter into financing arrangements with respect to the stock of TripAdvisor; and\n\u00b7\nCause TripSPV to enter into unrelated businesses or otherwise conduct business other than owning common stock or other shares of TripAdvisor.\nIn addition, as discussed above, the Margin Loan Agreements provide that, among other triggering events, if at any time the closing price per share of TripAdvisor common stock falls below certain minimum values, a partial repayment of the Margin Loans to certain specified amounts will be due and payable with respect to each such circumstance, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and if the company or TripSPV is unable to pay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the pledged stock of TripAdvisor that TripSPV holds and any other collateral that then secures TripSPV\u2019s obligations under the Margin Loan Agreements, which would materially adversely affect our asset composition and financial condition.\nAny failure to comply with the restrictions of the Margin Loan Agreements may result in an event of default under the agreements governing such facilities. Such default may allow the applicable creditors to accelerate the debt incurred thereunder. For additional information regarding the potential impact of the restrictions in these debt arrangements, see \u201cOur company may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\u201d\nOur company has overlapping directors and officers with Liberty, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband Corporation and Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc., which may lead to conflicting interests.\nAs a result of the TripCo Spin-Off, the September 2011 separation of Starz from Liberty, Liberty Media\u2019s spin-off of Liberty Broadband Corporation (\u201cLBC\u201d) and Liberty\u2019s split-off of Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. (\u201cExpedia Holdings\u201d), most of our executive officers also serve as executive officers of Liberty, Liberty Media, LBC and Expedia Holdings and there are overlapping directors. Other than Liberty\u2019s ownership of shares of LBC\u2019s non-voting Series C common stock, none of the foregoing companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and members of our company\u2019s board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Liberty, Liberty Media, LBC or Expedia Holdings have fiduciary duties to that company\u2019s stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our company, Liberty, Liberty Media, LBC or Expedia Holdings looks at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Moreover, most of our company\u2019s directors and officers own Liberty, Liberty Media, LBC and Expedia Holdings stock and equity awards. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company, Liberty, Liberty Media, LBC and/or Expedia Holdings. Any potential conflict that qualifies as a \u201crelated party transaction\u201d (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer\u2019s board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Each of our company, LBC and Liberty Expedia have renounced their rights to certain business opportunities and each company\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions deeming directors and officers not in breach of their fiduciary duties in certain cases for directing a corporate opportunity\nI-13\nto another person or entity (including Liberty, Liberty Media, LBC and Expedia Holdings) instead of such company. Any other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with Liberty, Liberty Media, LBC, Expedia Holdings and/or their subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, Liberty, Liberty Media, LBC, Expedia Holdings or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nOur inter-company agreements were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of Liberty.\nWe entered into a number of inter-company agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by Liberty for certain of our businesses. In addition, we entered into a services agreement with Liberty Media pursuant to which it provides to us certain management, administrative, financial, treasury, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which we pay Liberty Media a services fee. The terms of all of these agreements were established while we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty, and hence may not be the result of arms\u2019 length negotiations. Although we believe that the negotiations with Liberty Media were at arms\u2019 length, the persons negotiating on behalf of Liberty Media also serve as officers of Liberty, as described above. We believe that the terms of these inter-company agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements.\nFactors Relating to Our Businesses\nIf TripAdvisor is unable to continue to increase visitors to its websites and mobile apps and to cost-effectively convert these visitors into revenue-generating users, our revenue, financial results and business could be harmed.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s long term success depends on its continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of visitors flowing through its platforms in a cost effective manner, to engage users throughout the travel planning and booking phases and to attract consumers who will share their reviews from their trips. The primary asset that TripAdvisor uses to attract visitors to its websites and convert these visitors into engaged users and bookers is TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to collect or create, organize and distribute high-quality, commercially valuable content and products that meets users\u2019 specific interests. TripAdvisor\u2019s traffic and user engagement could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to increased competition, reduced consumer awareness of TripAdvisor\u2019s brands, declines or inefficiencies in traffic acquisition, and macroeconomic conditions. In the past year, certain of TripAdvisor\u2019s competitors have launched advertising campaigns expressly designed to drive consumer traffic directly to their websites, and these campaigns may negatively impact traffic to TripAdvisor\u2019s site. There can be no assurances that TripAdvisor will continue to provide content and products in a cost-effective manner or in a manner that meets rapidly changing consumer demand. Any failure to obtain and manage content and products in a cost-effective manner that will engage users, or any failure to provide content and products that are perceived as useful, reliable and trustworthy, could adversely affect user experiences and their repeat behavior, reduce traffic to its websites and negatively impact its business and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s dedication to making the user experience its highest priority may cause it to prioritize rapid innovation and user engagement over short-term financial results.\nTripAdvisor strives to create the best experience for its users, providing them with the information, research and tools to enable them to plan, book and experience the perfect trip. TripAdvisor believes that in doing so, it will increase its rates of conversion, revenue per shopper and, ultimately, its financial performance over the long-term. TripAdvisor has taken actions in the past and may continue to make decisions going forward that have the effect of reducing its short-term revenue or profitability if it believes that the decisions benefit the aggregate user experience. For example, TripAdvisor may introduce changes to existing products or new products that direct users away from formats or use cases where TripAdvisor has a proven means of monetization, e.g. its instant book product. In addition, TripAdvisor\u2019s approach of putting users first may negatively impact its relationship with existing or prospective advertisers. These actions and practices could result in a loss of advertisers, which in turn could harm TripAdvisor\u2019s results of operations. The short-term reductions in revenue or profitability could be more severe than TripAdvisor anticipates or these decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that TripAdvisor expects, in which case its user growth and engagement, its relationships with users and advertisers, and its business and results of operations could be harmed.\nI-14\nTripAdvisor derives a substantial portion of its revenue from advertising and any significant reduction in spending by its advertisers or redirections of advertising spend could harm its business.\nTripAdvisor derives a substantial portion of its revenue from the sale of advertising, primarily through click-based advertising and, to a lesser extent, display-based advertising. TripAdvisor enters into master advertising contracts with its advertising partners, however, these agreements are generally limited to matters such as privacy and compliance, payment terms and conditions, termination and indemnities and most can be terminated by its partners at will or on short notice. TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to grow advertising revenue with its existing or new advertising partners is dependent in large part on its ability to generate revenue for them relative to other alternatives. Advertisers will not continue to do business with TripAdvisor if their investment in such advertising does not generate sales leads, customers, bookings, or revenue and profit on a cost-effective basis. TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to provide value to its advertising partners depends on a number of factors, including acceptance of online advertising versus more traditional forms of advertising or more effective models, competitiveness of its products, traffic quality, perception of its platform, availability and accuracy of analytics and measurement solutions to demonstrate its value, and macroeconomic conditions, whether in the advertising industry generally, among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies. We cannot guarantee that TripAdvisor\u2019s current advertisers will fulfill their obligations under existing contracts, continue to advertise beyond the terms of existing contracts or enter into any additional contracts with it.\nClick-based advertising accounts for the majority of TripAdvisor\u2019s advertising revenue. TripAdvisor\u2019s CPC pricing for click-based advertising depends, in part, on competition between advertisers. If its large advertisers become less competitive with each other, merge with each other or with its competitors, focus more on per-click profit than on traffic volume, or are able to reduce CPCs, this could have an adverse impact on TripAdvisor\u2019s click-based advertising revenue which would, in turn, have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTripAdvisor relies on a relatively small number of significant advertising partners and any reduction in spending by or loss of these partners could seriously harm its business.\nTripAdvisor derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a relatively small number of partners and relies significantly on these relationships. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2016, TripAdvisor\u2019s two most significant advertising partners, Expedia and Priceline (and their subsidiaries), accounted for a combined 46% of its total revenue. While TripAdvisor enters into master advertising contracts with its partners, the terms of these agreements generally address matters such as privacy and compliance, payment terms and conditions, termination and indemnities and most of these contracts can be terminated by its partners at will or on short notice. If any of its significant advertisers were to cease or significantly curtail advertising on TripAdvisor\u2019s websites, TripAdvisor could experience a rapid decline in its revenue over a relatively short period of time which would have a material impact on its business.\nChanges in internet search engine algorithms and dynamics, or search engine disintermediation could have a negative impact on traffic for our sites and ultimately, our business and results of operations.\nWe and TripAdvisor rely heavily on internet search engines, such as Google, to generate traffic to our websites, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords as well as through free, or organic, search. Pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly, both technically and competitively. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected. In addition, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing our websites to place lower in organic search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking of our websites or those of our partners, or if competitive dynamics impact the cost or effectiveness of search engine optimization (\u201cSEO\u201d) or search engine marketing (\u201cSEM\u201d) in a negative manner, our business and financial performance would be adversely affected. Furthermore, our failure to successfully manage our SEO and SEM strategies could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic.\nIn addition, to the extent that Google or other leading search or metasearch engines that have a significant presence in TripAdvisor\u2019s key markets, disintermediate OTAs or travel content providers whether by offering their own\nI-15\ncomprehensive travel planning or shopping capabilities, or by referring leads to suppliers, other favored partners or themselves directly, there could be a material adverse impact on TripAdvisor\u2019s business and financial performance. To the extent these actions have a negative effect on TripAdvisor\u2019s search results and traffic to its site, TripAdvisor\u2019s business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nTripAdvisor also relies on application marketplaces, such as Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play, to drive downloads of its applications. In the future, Apple, Google or other marketplace operators may make changes to their marketplaces that make access to TripAdvisor\u2019s products more difficult. For example, TripAdvisor\u2019s applications may receive unfavorable treatment compared to the promotion and placement of competing applications, such as the order in which they appear within marketplaces. Similarly, if problems arise in TripAdvisor\u2019s relationships with providers of application marketplaces, traffic to its site and its user growth could be harmed.\nTripAdvisor continues to focus on its \u201cinstant booking\u201d feature despite anticipated and unanticipated challenges and risks which could have a negative impact on its business and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s instant booking is a feature that enables users to book a hotel reservation directly with a hotel or online travel agency partner while remaining on the TripAdvisor website. TripAdvisor believes that allowing users to book directly online without leaving the TripAdvisor site will result in a better user experience, increased user engagement and, ultimately, additional revenue to TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor began rolling this feature out the U.S. in 2014 and completed the roll out in international markets in 2016. TripAdvisor is currently focused on (i) improving the shopping experience to drive increased user engagement, better conversion and more bookings, and (ii) continuing to earn users\u2019 trust as their booking site of choice.\nThere are, however, additional risks associated with this feature. Currently TripAdvisor\u2019s instant booking feature is monetizing at a lower revenue per hotel shopper rate compared to its metasearch feature. While TripAdvisor expects to close this monetization gap, primarily by continuing to streamline its booking path to enhance user experience, persistently promoting the TripAdvisor brand as a booking channel and continuing to seek partners with strong branding and supply channels, there is no guarantee that these initiatives will ultimately be successful and, if not, TripAdvisor\u2019s revenue may be materially adversely affected. In addition, instant booking revenue recorded under the consumption model is recognized at the time the traveler completes his or her stay. Comparatively, revenue recognized under TripAdvisor\u2019s metasearch feature is recorded when a traveler makes the click-through to the travel partners\u2019 websites. In future periods, greater contribution of revenue from TripAdvisor\u2019s instant booking consumption model would result in additional revenue recognized at the time of a consumed stay and thus a shift in the timing of TripAdvisor\u2019s revenue recognition.\nConsumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates new challenges and, if TripAdvisor is unable to operate effectively on mobile devices, its business may be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through mobile devices, such as mobile phones, has increased substantially in the last few years and TripAdvisor anticipates that the rate of use of these devices will continue to grow. The mobile market in general remains a rapidly evolving market. As new devices and platforms are released, users may begin consuming content in a manner that is more difficult to monetize. Advertising opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices. In addition, given the device sizes and technical limitations of these devices, mobile consumers may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple companies providing similar service and instead prefer to use one or a limited number of apps for their hotel, restaurant and attractions activity.\nTo address these growing user demands, TripAdvisor continues to extend its platform to develop and improve upon its mobile applications and monetization strategies. However, currently, TripAdvisor monetizes users of mobile phone devices at a significantly lower rate compared to users who access its websites through desktop computers or tablets. If TripAdvisor is unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly and differentiated mobile offerings and websites optimized for mobile phone devices and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, or if TripAdvisor\u2019s mobile offerings are not used by consumers, TripAdvisor\u2019s future growth and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nI-16\nDeclines or disruptions in the economy in general and the travel industry in particular could adversely affect TripAdvisor\u2019s businesses and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s businesses and financial performance are affected by the health of the global economy generally as well as the travel industry and leisure travel in particular. Sales of travel services tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns and recessions when consumers engage in less discretionary spending, are concerned about unemployment or economic weakness, have reduced access to credit or experience other concerns that reduce their ability or willingness to travel. The global economy may be adversely impacted by unforeseen events beyond TripAdvisor\u2019s control, including incidents of actual or threatened terrorism, regional hostilities or instability, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters, political instability and health concerns (including epidemics or pandemics), defaults on government debt, significant increases in fuel and energy costs, tax increases and other matters that could reduce discretionary spending, tightening of credit markets, and further declines in consumer confidence. Decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for TripAdvisor\u2019s services and have a negative impact on its business, working capital and financial performance.\nIn addition, the uncertainty of macro-economic factors and their impact on consumer behavior, which may differ across regions, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on TripAdvisor\u2019s markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to effectively manage its business and adversely affect its results of operations.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). Since the referendum, global markets and foreign currency exchange rates have experienced increased volatility, including a sharp decline in the value of the British Pound Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar. To leave the European Union, the United Kingdom must provide official notice of its decision and negotiate the terms of its exit. This process could take two years or more. The effects of Brexit will depend on, among other things, the terms, nature and timetable of the exit and the parties have not yet established these terms. Brexit could adversely affect European and global economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others TripAdvisor cannot anticipate, may have a negative effect on the travel industry and may adversely affect TripAdvisor\u2019s business.\nTripAdvisor relies on the value of its brands and consumer trust in its brands. If TripAdvisor is not able to protect, maintain and enhance its brands, or if events occur that damage its reputation and brands, TripAdvisor\u2019s business may be harmed.\nTripAdvisor believes that the strength of its brands (particularly the TripAdvisor brand) has contributed significantly to its success and that maintaining and enhancing its brands is critical to expanding its base of users, to creating content and to attracting advertisers. As a result, TripAdvisor invests significantly in brand marketing. TripAdvisor expects these investments to continue, or even increase, as a result of a variety of factors, including relatively high levels of advertising spending from competitors, the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands, expansion into new geographies, products and product positioning where its brands are less well known, inflation in media pricing, and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines as destination sites for travelers. Such efforts may not maintain or enhance consumer awareness of its brands and, even if TripAdvisor is successful in its branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective or as efficient as they have been historically. If TripAdvisor is unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of its brands or to generate demand in a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on TripAdvisor\u2019s business and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s ability to protect, maintain and enhance its brand also depends largely on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in its products, in the quality and integrity of its content and other information found on its platform. If consumers do not believe TripAdvisor\u2019s recommended reviews to be useful and reliable, they may seek other services to obtain the information for which they are looking and may not return to TripAdvisor\u2019s platform as often in the future, or at all. In addition, unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, TripAdvisor\u2019s practices relating to privacy and data protection, product changes, competitive pressures, litigation or regulatory activity, could adversely affect its reputation with its users and its advertisers. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and\nI-17\nloyalty of TripAdvisor\u2019s user base and result in decreased revenue, which could adversely affect its business and financial results.\nTripAdvisor operates in an increasingly competitive global environment and its failure to compete effectively could reduce its market share and harm its financial performance.\nTripAdvisor competes in rapidly evolving and competitive markets. It faces competition for content, users, advertisers, online travel search and price comparison services, or what is known in the industry as hotel metasearch, and online reservations. In the competition to attract users to its platform, TripAdvisor relies on its ability to acquire traffic through offline brand recognition and brand-direct efforts such as online search, email and television. These marketing strategies can be impacted by competitive site content, changes to TripAdvisor\u2019s website architecture and page designs, changes to search engine ranking algorithms, updates in competitor advertising strategies, or changes to display ordering in search engine results such as preferred placement for internal products offered by search engines.\nTripAdvisor also competes with different types of companies in the various markets and geographies it participates in, including large and small companies in the travel space as well as broader service providers. More specifically:\n\u00b7\nIn TripAdvisor\u2019s Hotel segment, it faces competition from OTAs (including Expedia, Priceline and certain of their respective subsidiaries), hotel metasearch providers (including trivago, Kayak, Ctrip.com International, Ltd., and HotelsCombined), large online search, social media, and marketplace companies (including Google, Microsoft Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Facebook, Alibaba, and Amazon), traditional offline travel agencies, and global hotel chains seeking to promote direct bookings.\n\u00b7\nTripAdvisor also faces competition from different companies in each of the operating segments in its Non-Hotel segment. TripAdvisor\u2019s Attractions business competes with traditional travel agencies, wholesalers, and individual tour operators as well as Airbnb and similar websites that have added other travel services such as tours and activities. TripAdvisor\u2019s Restaurants business competes with other online restaurant reservation services, such as Yelp and OpenTable (a subsidiary of Priceline). TripAdvisor\u2019s Vacation Rentals business competes with companies focused on alternative lodging and shared accommodations, including Airbnb and HomeAway (a subsidiary of Expedia).\nMany of TripAdvisor\u2019s competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources compared to TripAdvisor and have expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic as well as large client bases. They also have the ability to leverage other aspects of their business to enable them to compete more effectively against TripAdvisor. In addition, many of TripAdvisor\u2019s competitors, including online search companies, continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in travel. TripAdvisor cannot provide assurance that it will be able to compete successfully against current, emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge, or provide differentiated products and services to its traveler base.\nCertain of the companies TripAdvisor does business with, including some of its click-based advertising partners, are also its competitors. The consolidation of TripAdvisor\u2019s competitors and partners, including Expedia (through its acquisitions of Orbitz, Travelocity, and HomeAway) and Priceline (through its acquisitions of Kayak and OpenTable), may affect TripAdvisor\u2019s relative competitiveness and its partner relationships. Competition and consolidation could result in higher traffic acquisition costs, reduced margins on TripAdvisor\u2019s advertising services, loss of market share, reduced customer traffic to its websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on its websites.\nAs the industry shifts towards online travel services and the technology supporting it continues to evolve, including platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices, competition is likely to intensify. Competition in TripAdvisor\u2019s industry may result in pricing pressure, loss of market share or decreased member engagement, any of which could adversely affect its business and financial performance.\nI-18\nTripAdvisor relies on information technology to operate its business and remain competitive, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm its business.\nTripAdvisor depends on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems for, among other things, website and mobile apps, supplier connectivity, communications, reservations, payment processing, procurement, customer services and fraud prevention. TripAdvisor\u2019s future success depends on its ability to continuously improve and upgrade its systems and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while at the same time maintaining the reliability and integrity of its systems and infrastructure. TripAdvisor may not be able to maintain or replace its existing systems or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as it would like or in a cost-effective manner. TripAdvisor may not be successful, or as successful as its competitors, in developing technologies and systems that operate effectively across multiple devices and platforms in a way that is appealing to its users. In addition, the emergence of alternative platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology. New developments in other areas, such as cloud computing, could also make it easier for competition to enter TripAdvisor\u2019s market due to lower up-front technology costs.\nIf TripAdvisor does not continue to innovate and provide tools and services that are useful to travelers, it may not remain competitive, and its business and financial performance could suffer.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s success depends in part on continued innovation to provide features and services that make its platform compelling to travelers. Its competitors are continually developing innovations in online travel-related services and features. As a result, TripAdvisor is continually working to improve its business model and user experience in order to drive user traffic and conversion rates. TripAdvisor can give no assurances that the changes it makes will yield the benefits it expects and will not have adverse impacts that TripAdvisor did not anticipate. If TripAdvisor is unable to continue offering innovative products and services and quality features that travelers want to use, existing users may become dissatisfied and use competitors\u2019 offerings and it may be unable to attract additional users, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor is dependent upon the quality of traffic in its network to provide value to online advertisers, and any failure in its quality control could have a material adverse effect on the value of its websites to its advertisers and adversely affect its revenue.\nTripAdvisor uses technology and processes to monitor the quality of the Internet traffic that it delivers to online advertisers and has identified metrics to demonstrate the quality of that traffic. These metrics are used not only to identify the value of advertising on TripAdvisor\u2019s website, but also to identify low quality clicks such as non-human processes, including robots, spiders or other software; the mechanical automation of clicking; and other types of invalid clicks or click fraud. Even with such monitoring in place, there is a risk that a certain amount of low-quality traffic, or traffic that online advertisers deem to be invalid, will be delivered to such online advertisers. As a result, TripAdvisor may be required to credit amounts owed to it by its advertisers. Furthermore, low-quality or invalid traffic may be detrimental to TripAdvisor\u2019s relationships with advertisers, and could adversely affect its advertising pricing and revenue.\nTripAdvisor relies on assumptions and estimates and data to calculate certain of its key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm TripAdvisor\u2019s reputation and negatively affect its business.\nTripAdvisor believes certain metrics are key to TripAdvisor\u2019s business, including unique visitors, hotel shoppers, revenue per hotel shopper, and number of reviews and opinions. As the industry in which it operates and its business continue to evolve, so too might the metrics by which TripAdvisor evaluates its business. While the calculation of these metrics is based on what TripAdvisor believes to be reasonable estimates, TripAdvisor\u2019s internal tools are not independently verified by a third party and have a number of limitations and, furthermore, its methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time. For example, a single person may have multiple accounts or browse the internet on multiple browsers or devices, some users may restrict TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to accurately identify them across visits, some mobile applications automatically contact its servers for regular updates with no user action, and it is not always able to capture user information on all of its platforms. As such, the calculations of its unique visitors may not accurately reflect the number of people actually visiting its platforms. TripAdvisor continues to improve upon its tools and methodologies\nI-19\nto capture data and believes that its current metrics are more accurate; however, the improvement of its tools and methodologies could cause inconsistency between current data and previously reported data, which could confuse investors or lead to questions about the integrity of its data. Also if the internal tools TripAdvisor uses to track these metrics under-count or over-count performance or contain algorithm or other technical errors, the data TripAdvisor reports may not be accurate. In addition, historically, certain metrics were calculated by independent third parties. Accordingly readers should not place undue reliance on these numbers.\nThe loss of one or more of TripAdvisor\u2019s key personnel, or its failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm TripAdvisor\u2019s business.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s future success depends upon the continued contributions of its senior corporate management and other key employees. In particular, the contributions of Stephen Kaufer, TripAdvisor\u2019s co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, are critical to its overall management. TripAdvisor cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of these individuals, and the loss of one or more of its key personnel could seriously harm its business. TripAdvisor does not maintain any key person life insurance policies.\nIn addition, competition remains intense for well-qualified employees in certain aspects of TripAdvisor\u2019s business, including software engineers, developers, product management and development personnel, and other technology professionals. TripAdvisor\u2019s continued ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. As a global company, TripAdvisor aims to attract quality employees from all over the world, so any restrictions on travel for professional or personal purposes, such as those put in place in the United States in early 2017, may cause significant disruption to TripAdvisor\u2019s businesses or negatively affect its ability to attract and retain employees on a global basis. If TripAdvisor does not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees, its business would be adversely affected.\nThe online vacation rental market is rapidly evolving and if TripAdvisor fails to predict the manner in which the market develops, its business and prospects may suffer.\nTripAdvisor offers vacation rental services on its TripAdvisor-branded sites as well as through its U.S.-based FlipKey and Vacation Home Rentals and European-based Holiday Lettings and Niumba businesses. The vacation rental market has been and continues to be, subject to regulatory development that affect the vacation rental industry and the ability of companies like TripAdvisor to list those vacation rentals online. For example, some states and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit property owners and managers from renting certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days or otherwise limit their ability to do so, and other states and local jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations. Some states and local jurisdictions also have fair housing or other laws governing whether and how properties may be rented, which they assert apply to vacation rentals. Many homeowners, condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict short-term vacation rentals. In addition, many of the fundamental statutes and ordinances that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, which creates a risk of these laws being used in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm TripAdvisor\u2019s business. Operating in this dynamic regulatory environment and in new and untested jurisdictions requires significant management attention and financial resources. TripAdvisor cannot assure that its efforts will be successful, and the investment and additional resources required to manage growth will produce the desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nTripAdvisor may be subject to claims that it violated intellectual property rights of others and these claims can be extremely costly to defend and could require TripAdvisor to pay significant damages and limit its ability to operate.\nCertain companies in the Internet and technology industries that own patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of those intellectual property rights in order to extract value from technology companies, such as royalties in connection with grants of licenses. TripAdvisor has received in the past, and expects in the future to receive notices that claim it has misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claim against TripAdvisor, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims also could subject TripAdvisor to significant liability for damages and could result in it having to stop using\nI-20\ntechnology or content found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. TripAdvisor might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, it could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase its operating expenses. TripAdvisor may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, or content, which could require significant effort and expense and make it less competitive in the relevant market. Any of these results could harm its business and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s acquisitions, investments, significant commercial arrangements and/or new business strategies could disrupt its ongoing business and present new challenges and risks.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s success will depend, in part, on its ability to expand its product offerings and expand user engagement in order to grow its business in response to changing technologies, user and advertiser demands and competitive pressures. As a result, TripAdvisor has acquired, invested in and/or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of new business in the past and its future growth may depend, in part, on future acquisitions, investments, commercial arrangements/or changes in business strategies, any of which could be material to its financial conditions and results of operations. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nExpected and unexpected costs incurred in identifying and pursuing these endeavors, and performing due diligence on potential targets that may or may not be successful;\n\u00b7\nUse of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding these endeavors that may limit other potential uses of TripAdvisor\u2019s cash, including stock repurchases, retirement of outstanding indebtedness and/or dividend payments;\n\u00b7\nAmortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and other adverse accounting consequences;\n\u00b7\nDiversion of TripAdvisor\u2019s management\u2019s attention or other resources from its existing business;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties and expenses in integrating the operations, products, technology, privacy protection systems, information systems or personnel of the company, including the assimilation of corporate cultures;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in implementing and retaining uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u00b7\nThe assumption of known and unknown debt and liabilities of the acquired company, including costs associated with litigation and other claims relating to the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nFailure of any company which TripAdvisor has acquired, in which it has invested, or with which it has a commercial arrangement, to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flows or to retain key management or employees;\n\u00b7\nFailure to generate adequate returns on acquisitions and investments;\n\u00b7\nWith respect to minority investments, limited management or operational control and reputational risk, which risk is heightened if the controlling person in such case has business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with those of TripAdvisor;\n\u00b7\nEntrance into markets in which TripAdvisor has no direct prior experience and increased complexity in its business;\n\u00b7\nImpairment of goodwill or other intangible assets such as trademarks or other intellectual property arising from acquisitions; and\n\u00b7\nAdverse market reaction to acquisitions.\nTripAdvisor has recently invested, and may in the future invest, in privately-held companies and these investments are currently accounted for under the cost method. Such investments are inherently risky in that such companies are typically at an early stage of development, may have no or limited revenues, may not be or may never become profitable, may not be able to secure additional funding or their technologies, services or products may not be\nI-21\nsuccessfully developed or introduced into the market. Further, TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to liquidate any such investments is typically dependent upon some liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition, since no public market exists for such securities. Valuations of such privately-held companies are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of liquid market for the company\u2019s securities. Moreover, TripAdvisor could lose the full amount of any of its investments and any impairment of its investments could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nTripAdvisor cannot assure you that these investments will be successful or that such endeavors will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible or that TripAdvisor will achieve these benefits within a reasonable period of time.\nNo assurance can be made that we will be successful in integrating any acquired businesses.\nOur subsidiaries may grow through acquisitions in selected markets. Integration of new businesses may present significant challenges, including: realizing economies of scale in programming and network operations; eliminating duplicative overhead; and integrating networks, financial systems and operational systems. No assurance can be made that, with respect to any acquisition, we will realize anticipated benefits or successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing operations. In addition, while we intend to implement appropriate controls and procedures as we integrate acquired companies, we may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of these companies\u2019 disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting (as required by U.S. federal securities laws and regulations) until we have fully integrated them.\nIf TripAdvisor fails to manage its growth effectively, its brand, results of operations and business could be harmed.\nTripAdvisor has experienced rapid growth in its headcount and operations, including through acquisitions of other businesses and in new international markets. TripAdvisor continues to make substantial investments in its technology and sales and marketing organizations. This grown places substantial demands on TripAdvisor\u2019s management and its operational infrastructure. In addition, as TripAdvisor\u2019s business matures, it makes periodic changes and adjustments to its organization in response to various internal and external considerations, including market opportunities, the competitive landscape, new and enhanced products and acquisitions. These changes may result in a temporary lack of focus or productivity or otherwise impact TripAdvisor\u2019s business.\nTo manage its growth, TripAdvisor may need to improve its operational, financial and management systems and processes which may require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. As TripAdvisor continues to grow, it must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, including employees in international markets, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of its company culture. If TripAdvisor does not manage the growth of its business and operations effectively, the quality of its platform and efficiency of its operations could suffer, which could harm its brand, results of operations and business.\nTripAdvisor is regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nTripAdvisor is regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving competition, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by its users, free speech issues, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using its platforms, and other matters. In addition, TripAdvisor\u2019s businesses face intellectual property litigation, that exposes it to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit its ability to sell products and services.\nSuch claims, suits, government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on TripAdvisor because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, injunctions or damage awards and other factors. Determining reserves for TripAdvisor\u2019s pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect TripAdvisor\u2019s business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in\nI-22\na particular period. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing TripAdvisor from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in TripAdvisor\u2019s business practices or other field action, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s international operations involve additional risks and its exposure to these risks increases as its business continues to expand globally.\nTripAdvisor operates in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States and continues to expand its international operations. Many of these regions have different economic conditions, languages, currencies, consumer expectations, levels of consumer acceptance and use of the Internet for commerce, legislation, regulatory environments (including labor laws and customs), tax laws and levels of political stability. TripAdvisor is subject to associated risks typical of international businesses, including but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nLocal economic or political instability;\n\u00b7\nThreatened or actual acts of terrorism;\n\u00b7\nCompliance with additional laws applicable to companies operating internationally as well as local laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act, data privacy requirements, labor and employment law, laws regarding advertisements and promotions and anti-competition regulations;\n\u00b7\nDiminished ability to legally enforce contractual rights;\n\u00b7\nIncreased risk and limits on enforceability of intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on, or adverse consequences related to, the withdrawal of non-U.S. investment and earnings;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on repatriation of cash as well as restrictions on investments in operations in certain countries;\n\u00b7\nFinancial risk arising from transactions in multiple currencies, as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\u00b7\nSlower adoption of the Internet as an advertising, broadcast and commerce medium in certain of those markets as compared to the United States;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in managing staff and operations due to distance, time zones, language and cultural differences; and\n\u00b7\nUncertainty regarding liability for services, content and intellectual property rights, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of precedent.\nTripAdvisor has a business operating in China, which creates particular risks and uncertainties relating to the laws in China. The laws and regulations of China restrict foreign investment in areas including air-ticketing and travel agency services, Internet content provision, mobile communication and related businesses. Although TripAdvisor has established effective control of its Chinese business through a series of agreements, future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations or a dispute relating to these agreements could restrict TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to operate or restructure this business or to engage in strategic transactions. The success of this business, and of any future investments in China, is subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the application, development and interpretation of China\u2019s laws and regulations.\nFurthermore, TripAdvisor is also accumulating a greater portion of its cash flows in foreign jurisdictions, which it considers indefinitely reinvested. The repatriation of such funds for use in the United States, including for corporate purposes such as acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or debt refinancings, may result in additional U.S. income tax expense and higher cost for such capital.\nI-23\nA failure to comply with current laws, rules and regulations or changes to such laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our subsidiaries or our financial performance.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to us, our business and our subsidiaries, including those relating to the Internet and online commerce, Internet advertising and online commerce, consumer protection, data security and privacy, travel and vacation rental licensing and listing requirements and tax. In some cases, these laws continue to evolve.\nFor example, there is, and will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet, online editorial and user-generated content, user privacy, data security, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, liability for third-party activities and the quality of products and services. In addition, enforcement authorities in the United States continue to rely on their authority under existing consumer protection laws to take action against companies relating to data privacy and security practices. The growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts, which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally.\nFurther, TripAdvisor\u2019s vacation rentals business has been and continues to be subject to regulatory developments that affect the vacation rental industry and the ability of competitors like TripAdvisor to list those vacation rentals online. For example, some states and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting statutes or ordinances that prohibit property owners and managers from renting certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days. Some states and local jurisdictions also have fair housing or other laws governing whether and how properties may be rented, which they assert apply to vacation rentals. Many homeowners, condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict short-term vacation rentals.\nTripAdvisor also has been subject, and it will likely be subject in the future, to inquiries from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection, competition, tax and travel industry-specific laws and regulations. The failure of its businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against TripAdvisor by governmental agencies and/or consumers, which if material, could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market, TripAdvisor\u2019s compliance with such laws may put it at a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis competitors who do not comply with such requirements.\nThe promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations, or the new interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations, in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which TripAdvisor provides services could require it to change certain aspects of its business, operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenue, increase costs and/or subject the company to additional liabilities. Unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and services, limit marketing methods and capabilities, increase costs and/or subject TripAdvisor to additional liabilities. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or criminal sanctions against TripAdvisor, its officers or its employees and/or prohibitions on the conduct of its business.\nTripAdvisor cannot be sure that its intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others, including potential competitors.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s websites rely on content, brands and technology, much of which is proprietary. TripAdvisor protects its proprietary content, brands and technology by relying on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and confidentiality agreements. Any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on TripAdvisor\u2019s business. Even with these precautions, it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use TripAdvisor\u2019s proprietary technology, content or brands without authorization or to develop similar technology, content or brands independently.\nI-24\nEffective intellectual property protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and expenses and the costs of defending TripAdvisor\u2019s rights. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which its services are made available, and policing unauthorized use of its intellectual property is difficult and expensive. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, TripAdvisor may be unable to protect its intellectual property adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect its business or ability to compete. TripAdvisor cannot be sure that the steps it has taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of its intellectual property. Furthermore, TripAdvisor may need to go to court or other tribunals or administrative bodies in order to enforce its intellectual property rights, to protect its trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. TripAdvisor\u2019s failure to protect its intellectual property in a cost-effective or effective manner could have a material adverse effect on its business and ability to protect its technology, content and brands.\nTripAdvisor currently licenses from third parties and incorporates the technologies and content into its websites. As TripAdvisor continues to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies and content, it may be required to license additional technology or content. TripAdvisor cannot be sure that such technology or content will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 processing, storage and use of personal information and other data exposes them to risks of external and internal security breaches and could give rise to liabilities.\nOur subsidiaries are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other consumer data, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. In addition, the security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential to maintaining consumer and travel service provider confidences in their services. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the Internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including the FTC and the Department of Commerce, are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet. Various U.S. courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes, including computer trespass and wiretapping laws, to the collection and exchange of information online. In addition, the European Union has adopted a new data protection legal framework, effective in May 2018, which may result in greater compliance burden for companies, including our subsidiaries, with users in Europe and increased costs of compliance.\nPotential security breaches to our subsidiaries\u2019 systems, whether resulting from internal or external sources, could significantly harm our businesses. A party, whether internal or external, that is able to circumvent their security systems could misappropriate user information or proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in their operations. In the past, our subsidiaries have experienced \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks on their systems that have made portions of their websites unavailable for short periods of time as well as unauthorized access of their systems and data. Our subsidiaries also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties conducting business over the Internet. For example, much of TripAdvisor\u2019s business is conducted with third party marketing affiliates, or, more recently, through business partners powering TripAdvisor\u2019s instant booking feature. In addition, our subsidiaries frequently use third parties to process credit card payments. A security breach at such third party could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of our subsidiaries\u2019 systems and could result in negative publicity, damage our subsidiaries\u2019 reputation, expose them to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject them to regulatory penalties and sanctions. In addition, such third parties may not comply with applicable disclosure requirements, which could expose our subsidiaries to liability.\nOur subsidiaries strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. Any failure or perceived failure by them to comply with their privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements that could harm their reputation and cause their customers and members to lose trust in them, which could have an adverse effect on their business, brand, market share\nI-25\nand results of operations. Our subsidiaries may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to investigate and address problems caused by breaches, and reductions in website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident. Because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, our subsidiaries may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Security breaches could result in negative publicity, damage to reputation, exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions. Security breaches could also cause travelers, other users and potential users to lose confidence in their security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our subsidiaries\u2019 brands. Failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions, whether for their own systems or systems of vendors, could expose our subsidiaries to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance.\nIn addition, TripAdvisor has acquired a number of companies over the years and may continue to do so in the future. While TripAdvisor makes significant efforts to address any information technology security issues with respect to its acquisitions, it may still inherit such risks when it integrates the acquired businesses.\nSystem interruption and the lack of redundancy in some of its internal information systems may harm our subsidiaries\u2019 business.\nOur subsidiaries rely on computer systems to deliver content and services. Our subsidiaries have experienced, and may in the future experience, system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent them from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing content and services to users and third parties. Significant interruptions, outages or delays in internal systems, or systems of third parties that they rely upon or deterioration in the performance of any such systems, would impair our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to process transactions or display content and decrease the quality of the services they offer to travelers and users. These interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on their systems for fraud or service interruption (called \u201cdenial of service\u201d or \u201cbot\u201d attacks). Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time. If our subsidiaries experience frequent or persistent system failures, their reputation and brand could be permanently and significantly harmed.\nAlthough our subsidiaries have put measures in place to protect certain portions of their facilities and assets, any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent them from providing content and services to users, travelers and/or third parties for a significant period of time. In addition, remediation may be costly and our subsidiaries may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs. Moreover, the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on its financial results and could increase the volatility of those results.\nDue to the global nature of its business, TripAdvisor is subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. In the event TripAdvisor incurs net income in certain jurisdictions but incurs losses in other jurisdictions, it generally cannot offset the income from one jurisdiction with the loss from another, which could increase its effective tax rate. Furthermore, significant judgment is required to calculate TripAdvisor\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes and depends on its ability to operate its business in a manner consistent with its corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. In the ordinary course of its business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nTripAdvisor believes its tax estimates are reasonable. However, TripAdvisor is routinely under audit by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The taxing authorities of jurisdictions in which TripAdvisor operates may challenge its methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including its transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which it operates its business does not achieve the intended tax consequences, which would increase TripAdvisor\u2019s effective tax rate and harm its financial position and results of operations. As TripAdvisor operates\nI-26\nin numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can also be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by taxing authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities of different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm\u2019s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. The final determination of audits could be materially different from TripAdvisor\u2019s income tax provisions and accruals and could have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nAdditionally, TripAdvisor earns an increasing portion of its income, and accumulates a greater portion of cash flow, in foreign jurisdictions which it considers indefinitely reinvested. Any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and incremental cash tax payments. In addition, there have been proposals to amend U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact the manner in which U.S. companies are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation will pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on TripAdvisor\u2019s U.S. tax expense and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings, or the examination of TripAdvisor\u2019s tax positions, could materially affect its financial position and results of operations.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. TripAdvisor\u2019s existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner it believes is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws. However, the tax benefits that TripAdvisor intends to eventually derive could be undermined due to changing tax laws. In particular, the current U.S. administration and key members of Congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority, resulting in uncertainty not only with respect to the future corporate tax rate, but also the U.S. tax consequences of income derived from income related to intellectual property earned overseas in low tax jurisdictions. Certain changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside of the United States until those earnings are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could affect the tax treatment of TripAdvisor\u2019s foreign earnings.\nIn addition, the taxing authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions where TripAdvisor does business regularly examine its income and other tax returns as well as the tax returns of Expedia, TripAdvisor\u2019s former parent. The ultimate outcome of these examinations (including the IRS audit described below) cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the IRS or other taxing authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations, TripAdvisor may be required to record charges to its operations, which could harm its business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn connection with TripAdvisor\u2019s spin-off from Expedia (the \u201cSpin-Off\u201d), TripAdvisor could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nUnder the tax sharing agreement between TripAdvisor and Expedia entered into in connection with the Spin-Off, TripAdvisor is generally required to indemnify Expedia for any taxes resulting from the spin-off (and any related interest, penalties, legal and professional fees, and all costs and damages associated with related stockholder litigation or controversies) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) any act or failure to act by TripAdvisor described in the covenants in the tax sharing agreement, (ii) any acquisition of TripAdvisor\u2019s equity securities or assets or those of a member of its group, or (iii) any failure of the representations with respect to TripAdvisor or any member of its group to be true or any breach by TripAdvisor or any member of its group of any covenant, in each case, which is contained in the separation documents or in the documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel.\nTripAdvisor continues to be responsible for potential tax liabilities in connection with consolidated income tax returns filed with Expedia prior to or in connection with the Spin-Off. By virtue of previously filed consolidated tax returns with Expedia, TripAdvisor is currently under an IRS audit for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax years. In connection with that audit, TripAdvisor received notices of proposed adjustment from the IRS for the 2009 and 2010 tax years in January 2017, which would result in an increase in TripAdvisor\u2019s worldwide income tax expense. The proposed adjustments would result in an increase to TripAdvisor\u2019s worldwide income tax expense in an estimated range of $10 million to $14 million after consideration of competent authority relief, exclusive of interest and penalties. TripAdvisor is also subject to various\nI-27\nongoing state income tax audits. The outcome of these matters or any other audits could subject TripAdvisor to significant tax liabilities.\nTripAdvisor is subject to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange risk.\nTripAdvisor conducts a significant and growing portion of its business outside the United States, but reports its results in U.S. dollars. As a result, TripAdvisor faces exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly those related to the Euro, British pound sterling and Australian dollar. These exposures include, but are not limited to re-measurement of gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities; translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation; and planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time TripAdvisor prepares its annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur.\nDepending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates, if TripAdvisor were to choose not to hedge or were to fail to hedge effectively its exposure, TripAdvisor could experience a material adverse effect on its financial statements and financial condition. As seen in some recent periods, in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates, the impact of these exposures can increase, and the impact on results of operations can be more pronounced. In addition, the current environment and the increasingly global nature of TripAdvisor\u2019s business have made hedging these exposures both more complex. TripAdvisor hedges certain short-term foreign currency exposures with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These forward exchange contracts only help mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counter-party failure. There can be no assurance that its forward exchange contracts will have their intended effects.\nSignificant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect consumer travel behavior. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and its impact on consumer behavior, which may differ across regions, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on TripAdvisor\u2019s markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect its ability to effectively manage its business and adversely affect its results of operations.\nFuture sales of shares of TripAdvisor\u2019s or our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, may depress its or our stock price.\nFor the period ended December 31, 2016, the average daily trading volume of TripAdvisor\u2019s common stock on Nasdaq was approximately 2.2 million shares. If its existing stockholders or their distributees were to sell substantial amounts of TripAdvisor\u2019s common stock in the public market, the market price of its common stock and hence our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that TripAdvisor\u2019s existing stockholders or our stockholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress the trading price of TripAdvisor\u2019s common stock and hence our common stock. For example, sales of or hedging transactions, such as collars, in our shares by any of our directors or executive officers could cause a perception in the marketplace that our stock price (and hence TripAdvisor\u2019s stock price) has peaked or that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at our company or TripAdvisor. This perception could result notwithstanding any personal financial motivation for these insider transactions. In addition, we have the right to require TripAdvisor to file registration statements covering TripAdvisor shares we own or to include TripAdvisor shares in registration statements that it may file for itself or other stockholders. A decline in the price of shares of TripAdvisor\u2019s common stock or our common stock might impede its or our ability to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities.\nThe seasonality of our subsidiary BuySeasons places increased strain on its operations.\nThe net revenue of BuySeasons in recent years indicates that its business is seasonal due to a higher volume of sales in certain months or calendar quarters or related to holiday shopping. BuySeasons earns approximately half of its revenue from the sale of costumes in September and October leading up to Halloween. If the vendors for BuySeasons\u2019 business are not able to provide popular products in sufficient amounts such that BuySeasons fails to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect its revenue and future growth. If too many customers access the websites of BuySeasons within a short period of time due to increased demand, its business may experience system interruptions that\nI-28\nmake its websites unavailable or prevent them from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods it sells and the attractiveness of its products and services. In addition, BuySeasons may be unable to adequately staff its fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other third party shipping (or carrier) companies may be unable to meet the seasonal demand.\nFactors Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may be disproportionately affected by the results of operations of TripAdvisor and developments in its business.\nThe fair value of our investment in TripAdvisor, on an as-converted basis, was approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2016, which represents a significant portion of our total market value. Since the TripCo Spin-Off in 2014, our share price has had a tendency to move in tandem with the share price of TripAdvisor's common stock. As a result, our stock price may be disproportionately affected by the results of operations of TripAdvisor and developments in its business.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7\nclassifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nrequiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 80% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u00b7\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, Gregory B. Maffei, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns shares representing the power to direct approximately 27% of the aggregate voting power in our company, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 95% of the outstanding shares of our Series B common stock as of January 31, 2017.\nHolders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.\nPrinciples of Delaware law and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the\nI-29\nholders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14873, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LTRPA"}
