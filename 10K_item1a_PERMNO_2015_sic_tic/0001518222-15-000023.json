{"cik": "1518222", "company": "Bankrate, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves risk. You should carefully consider the following risks as well as the other information included in this Annual Report, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes, before investing in our securities. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and cause the value of our securities to decline, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Company.\nRisks Related to the Restatement and Other Accounting Issues\nThe Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors are named as defendants in a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws and could be named as parties in additional lawsuits related to our Restatement or as a result of the ongoing investigations by the SEC and DOJ. These as well as the results of the underlying SEC and DOJ investigations could adversely affect the Company, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses (including settlement costs) or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nIn September and October 2014, the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors were named as defendants in putative class action lawsuits alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. One such lawsuit remains pending. The action alleges, among other things, that the Company\u2019s 2011, 2012, and 2013 financial statements improperly recognized revenues and expenses and therefore were materially false and misleading. In February 2015, the complaint was amended to add allegations relating to the Company\u2019s March 2014 secondary offering of Company common stock. See the section entitled \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d This lawsuit, and other lawsuits in which the Company and its current and former officers and directors could be named arising out of our Restatement or as a result of the ongoing investigations by the SEC and DOJ, could adversely affect the Company, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages (including settlement amounts), and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer. We could be subject to fines, settlement costs, penalties, or other sanctions as a result of the ongoing investigations being conducted by the SEC and DOJ.\nWe have been responding to ongoing investigations conducted by the staff of the SEC and by the DOJ concerning our financial reporting over various periods of time. These matters have required and continue to require us to expend substantial management time and incur significant legal and other expenses. We are attempting to resolve these matters and the Company has agreed to the terms of a potential settlement of the SEC investigation with respect to the Company that the SEC enforcement staff has indicated it is prepared to recommend to the Commission. The proposed settlement is subject to acceptance and authorization by the Commission and would, among other things, require the Company to pay a $15.0 million penalty. As a result, the Company recorded an accrual in the amount of $15.0 million. However, the terms of the settlement have not been approved by the Commission and therefore there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s efforts to resolve the SEC\u2019s investigation with respect to the Company will be successful, that the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsettlement amount will be as anticipated or that the reserve with respect thereto will be sufficient, and the Company cannot predict the ultimate timing or the final terms of any settlement.\nOur indemnification obligations and potential limitations of our director and officer liability insurance could result in significant legal expenses or damages and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nCertain of our current and former officers and directors are the subject of the above-referenced government investigations and lawsuits as individual defendants. Under Delaware law, our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and certain indemnification agreements, we have indemnification obligations to these current and former officers and directors in relation to these matters. These indemnity obligations have resulted and may continue to result in significant legal expenses or damages and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow to suffer.\nWhile we maintain director and officer liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the insurance carriers will not seek to take the position that costs and expenses associated with the ongoing investigations or costs of resolution are not subject to insurance coverage or that even if covered, the amounts incurred will not exceed the maximum amount of available insurance.\nThe SEC and DOJ investigations, class action lawsuit and other issues in connection with the Restatement could have an adverse impact on our business relationships.\nOur operations and business rely on our reputation with consumers and relationships with our advertisers, co-brand partners, distribution partners, print partners and other business partners. The SEC and DOJ investigations, class action lawsuit and other issues in connection with the Restatement could have an adverse impact on our business relationships with our partners. Among other outcomes, these partners may seek out new partners or rely on their other partners more heavily, and reduce or potentially become unwilling to do business with us, causing our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nWe have restated certain of our prior consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including shareholder litigation, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.\nAs discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we have restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, for the quarterly periods within the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014.\nIn connection with the Restatement, we incurred substantial unanticipated costs (primarily an accrual for a potential settlement with the SEC and for legal and accounting expenses) of approximately $23.6 million in 2014 and approximately $4.0 million through March 31, 2015. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur in 2015 additional costs related to the Restatement and related internal control remediation. We have been required to expend significant time and resources in connection with the Restatement, and the attention of our management team has been diverted by these efforts.\nAs a result of these events, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including substantial unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the Restatement and shareholder litigation. Likewise, such events might cause a diversion of significant management time and attention. In addition, the fact that we have completed a restatement may lead to a loss of investor confidence and have negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have identified a material weakness in the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting that has materially adversely affected our ability to timely and accurately report our results of operations and financial condition. This material weakness has not been fully remediated as of the filing date of this report and we do not know when this weakness will be fully remediated or how costly our efforts in furtherance thereof will be.\nAs a result of the circumstances which gave rise to the Restatement, we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, we had a material weakness in the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and that, as a result, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at such date. See Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe are in the process of implementing efforts to remediate the identified material weakness. Our efforts have been and will continue to be time consuming and expensive. We cannot give any assurance as to when we will complete our efforts to fully remediate the material weakness or the total costs we will incur in these efforts.\nIf we are unable to effectively implement our remediation plan and adequately manage our internal controls over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and may lead investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial data specifically and in the Company generally.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf we are unable to effectively implement our remediation plan and adequately manage our internal controls over financial reporting in the future, we may be unable to produce accurate or timely financial information. As a result, we may be unable to meet our ongoing reporting obligations or comply with applicable legal requirements, which could lead to the imposition of sanctions or further investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements could lead investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial data and could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock. Significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain.\nIf we are unable to timely deliver our financial information in the future, we may be in default under the Senior Notes Indenture and our existing revolving credit agreement, which default could result in the acceleration of the payment of principal and accrued interest thereunder and under the Notes.\nThe Senior Notes Indenture and our existing Credit Agreement as defined below each contain covenants that require us to deliver certain financial information within a specified time. On November 6, 2014, the Company announced it had obtained a waiver under the Credit Agreement with respect to compliance with its obligation to deliver the requisite financial information for the quarter ended September 30, 2014. On March 24, 2015, the Company announced it had obtained a waiver under the Credit Agreement with respect to compliance with its obligation to deliver the requisite financial information for the year ended December 31, 2014. On May 11, 2015, the Company announced it had obtained a waiver under the Credit Agreement with respect to compliance with its obligation to deliver the requisite financial information for the quarter ended March 31, 2015.\nIn addition, as previously reported in the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 14, 2014, pursuant to the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 14, 2014 (the \u201cSecond Supplemental Indenture\u201d), by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company party thereto as guarantors and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, the Company obtained an extension of the time permitted to deliver the requisite financial information for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 and, subject to payment by the Company of an additional consent fee (as described in the Second Supplemental Indenture), for the year ended December 31, 2014. Subsequently, as previously reported in the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 15, 2015, pursuant to the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 11, 2015 (the \u201cThird Supplemental Indenture\u201d), by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company party thereto as guarantors and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, the Company obtained an extension of the time permitted to deliver the requisite financial information for the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and March 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn connection with the filing of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for year 2014 and the forthcoming filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2015, the Company has delivered and intends to deliver the requisite financial information in respect of the quarter ended September 30, 2014, the year ended December 31, 2014 and the quarter ended March 31, 2015 within the time permitted by the terms of the Third Supplemental Indenture and as required under the Credit Agreement. If, however, we are unable to timely deliver the financial information required under the Senior Notes Indenture and Credit Agreement in the future, and are unable to obtain sufficient consents from the holders of the Notes and our lenders under the Credit Agreement to obtain additional waivers, we would be in default under the Senior Notes Indenture and the Credit Agreement, and the trustee or holders of the Notes, in respect of our obligations under Senior Notes Indenture and Notes, or the lenders under the Credit Agreement, in respect of our obligations thereunder, would have the right to accelerate payment of principal and accrued interest. Further, each of the Senior Notes Indenture and Credit Agreement contain customary cross-default provisions that could, if we are able to obtain sufficient consents from the holder of the Notes but not our lenders under the Credit Agreement, or vice versa, result in acceleration of the payment of principal and accrued interest under both the Senior Notes Indenture and Notes and Credit Agreement. If we are unable to pay such accelerated obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture and the Notes or the Credit Agreement, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDelayed filing of some of our periodic SEC reports has made us currently ineligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nBecause we were unable to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 with the SEC on a timely basis, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 until we have timely filed all periodic reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for one year. It is possible that the final terms of any settlement with the SEC may further prolong our inability to register securities on Form S-3. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are eligible to use Form S-3, our transaction costs would increase and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially harming our financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe have not been in compliance with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange for continued listing and our common stock may be delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange if the New York Stock Exchange does not agree that we have adequately remedied our non-compliance, which could have a material effect on us and our shareholders.\nWe have been delinquent in the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, as a result of which we have not been in compliance with the listing rules of the NYSE.\nBy filing our December 31, 2014 Form 10-K and our March 31, 2015 Form 10-Q, which we intend to file shortly, we currently believe that we will have adequately remedied our current non-compliance with NYSE\u2019s listing rules. However, there can be no assurance that the NYSE will concur that we have remedied our current non-compliance, in which case our common stock could remain subject to delisting by NYSE. If our common stock were delisted, there would be no assurance whether or when it would again be listed for trading on NYSE or any other securities exchange. In addition, the market price of our shares might decline and become more volatile, and our shareholders might find that their ability to trade in our stock would be adversely affected. Furthermore, institutions whose charters do not allow them to hold securities in unlisted companies might sell our shares, which could have a further adverse effect on the price of our stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur success depends on revenue from online advertising and the sale of financial and senior care consumer inquiries.\nWe have historically derived, and we expect to continue to derive, the majority of our revenue through the monetization of consumer inquiries and the sale of advertising impressions on our online network, financial product consumer inquiries and senior care consumer inquiries. Any factors that limit the amount our customers are willing to and do spend on advertising with us, or to purchase consumer inquiries from us, could have a material and adverse effect on our business. These factors may include:\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain a significant number of unique website visitors, mobile visitors and application users;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness or interest of banks, lenders, brokers, credit card issuers, insurance carriers and agents, senior care providers and other advertisers in the business verticals in which we operate to advertise on our websites or mobile applications or purchase our leads, clicks, calls and referrals;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of conversion of visitors to some of our websites or mobile applications into credit card applicants and the rate at which credit card applications from consumers that come through our websites or mobile applications are approved by our credit card issuer customers;\n\u00b7\nchanges in law or regulation, or the enforcement of laws or regulations, including without limitation with respect to the advertising of personal financial services or senior care services, the provision of financial product consumer inquiries or senior care consumer inquiries, or privacy;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of conversion of consumers\u2019 visits to our websites or mobile applications into transaction fees and/or revenue from banks, mortgage brokers, or insurance agents or carriers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain and increase our relationships with third-party insurance lead sources and maintain the quality of our lead product sourced from third parties;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of conversion of consumers\u2019 visits to our websites or mobile applications into senior care referrals and the rate at which those referrals result in move-ins with our senior care customers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to compete with alternative advertising sources;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain a significant number of sellable impressions generated from website visitors available to advertisers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to accurately assess the number and demographic characteristics of our visitors;\n\u00b7\nour ability to handle temporary high volume traffic spikes to our online network;\n\u00b7\nour ability to convince traditional media advertisers to advertise on our online network;\n\u00b7\nour ability to increase traffic to our online network; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire and generate insurance consumer inquiries.\nMost of our customer contracts are short-term and are subject to termination by the customer at any time and/or do not have any minimum purchase requirements. Customers who have longer-term contracts may fail to honor their existing contracts, fail to renew their contracts or reduce their purchase volume under those contracts. If a significant number of customers or a few large customers decide not to continue advertising with us or purchasing our consumer inquiries, or materially reduce such activities, we could experience an immediate and substantial decline in our revenues and operating results over a relatively short period of time.\nIn addition, a failure to continue to successfully execute on our strategy within our insurance channel, including without limitation our initiative to continue to improve and maintain the quality of our consumer inquiries, could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results.\nWe face intense competition in all our businesses, and we expect competition to remain intense in the future. We compete with, among others, search engines utilizing keyword cost-per-click advertising or comparison advertising sites/networks; lead aggregators and websites committed to specific personal finance or senior care products; numerous websites in each of our vertical categories competing for traffic and for advertisers; financial institutions, including mortgage lenders, deposit institutions, credit card issuers and insurance providers, many of whom are also our customers; and traditional offline personal finance marketing channels, including direct mail, retail bank branch networks, television, radio, print advertising and call centers. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do and could use those resources to develop more directly competitive product offerings and editorial content and undertake advertising campaigns to promote those new offerings and content, which could result in diminished traffic to our online services and reduce our overall competitive and market position. In addition, new competitors may enter this market as there are few barriers to entry. For example, Google presents comparisons of credit cards and insurance products through its search engine, and in the past has presented and in the future may present comparisons of mortgage or deposit rates through its search engine, which may divert consumers away from our online services, including consumers who would otherwise find, be directed or be linked to our online services through the Google search engine. If one of those competitors was successful in such efforts, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results. Our online competitors may adopt certain aspects of our business model or replicate the appearance and features of our online services, which could reduce our ability to differentiate our services. Many of our existing competitors, as well as a number of potential new competitors, have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. Many competitors have complementary products or services that drive traffic to their online services. In the future, competitors could introduce superior products and services or reduce prices below ours. Increased competition could result in lower consumer traffic, advertising rate reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe depend upon Internet search engines to attract a significant portion of the visitors to our websites, and any change in the prominence of our websites in either paid or algorithmic search result listings could cause the number of visitors to our websites and our revenue to decline.\nWe depend in significant part on various Internet search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, and other search websites to direct a significant number of visitors to our websites to provide our online services to our clients. Search websites typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic and paid listings. Algorithmic, or organic, listings are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas designed by search companies. Paid listings can be purchased and then are displayed if particular words are included in a user\u2019s Internet search. Placement in paid listings is generally not determined solely on the bid price, but also takes into account the search engines\u2019 assessment of the quality of the website featured in the paid listing and other factors. We rely on both algorithmic and paid search results, as well as advertising on other websites, to direct a substantial share of the visitors to our websites.\nOur ability to maintain the number of visitors to our websites from Internet search websites and other websites is not entirely within our control. For example, Internet search websites frequently revise their algorithms in an attempt to optimize their search result listings or to implement their internal standards and strategies. Changes in the algorithms could cause our websites to receive less favorable placements, which could reduce the number of users who visit our websites. We have experienced and continue to experience fluctuations in the search result rankings for a number of our websites.\nIn addition, the prominence of the placement of our advertisements is in part determined by the amount we are willing to pay for the advertisement. We bid against our competitors for the display of paid search engine advertisements and some of our competitors have greater resources with which to bid and better brand recognition than we have. If competition for the display of paid advertisements in response to search terms related to our online services increases, our online advertising expenses could rise significantly or we may be required to reduce the number of our paid search advertisements. If we were to reduce our advertising with search engines, our consumer traffic may significantly decline or we may be unable to maintain a cost-effective search engine marketing program.\nOther factors, such as search engine technical difficulties, search engine technical changes and technical or presentation changes we make to our websites, could also cause our websites to be listed less prominently in algorithmic search results. In addition, search engines retain broad discretion to remove from search results any company whose marketing practices are deemed to be inconsistent with the search engine\u2019s guidelines. If our marketing practices do not comply with search engine guidelines, we may, without warning, not appear in search result listings at all. Any adverse effect on the placement of our websites in search engine results could reduce the number of users who visit our websites. In turn, any reduction in the number of visitors to our websites would negatively affect our ability to earn revenue. If visits to our websites decrease, our revenue may decline or we may need to resort to more costly sources to replace lost visitors, and such decreased revenue and/or increased expense could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur visitor traffic can be impacted by interest rate volatility.\nWe provide interest rate information for mortgages and other loans, credit cards and a variety of deposit accounts. Visitor traffic to our online platforms tends to increase with interest rate movements. Factors that have caused significant visitor fluctuations in the past have been Federal Reserve Board actions and general market conditions affecting home mortgage and deposit interest rates and access to credit. Additionally, the level of traffic to our websites can be dependent on interest rate levels as well as mortgage financing and refinancing activity. Accordingly, a slowdown in mortgage production or refinancing volumes could have a material and adverse effect on our business. Conversely, a sudden, significant change in interest rates could dramatically increase our page views such that we would be unable to sell sufficient advertisements to take full advantage of the spike in traffic.\nWe depend on third-parties for a significant portion of our insurance product consumer inquiries and traffic and to a lesser extent for our banking, credit card and senior care traffic and revenues, and any material decline in our relationships with these third parties, or increase in the price of consumer inquiries from these third parties, could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues or operating results.\nA significant portion of our revenue from our insurance channel is attributable to consumer inquiries sourced from third-parties, including but not limited to website publishers, lead aggregators and email marketers. In many instances, these third parties can change the inventory they make available to us at any time and, therefore, impact our revenue. If these third parties decide not to make inventory available to us, are purchased by one of our competitors or another company that decide to no longer make inventory available to us, or decide to demand a higher price for their products, we may not be able to find replacement inventory from other sources that satisfy our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues or operating results.\nIn addition, our failure to mitigate risks associated with this traffic and consumer inquiries from third party sources within our insurance channel by developing larger direct and organic traffic could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues or operating results.\nIf we fail to keep pace with rapidly-changing technologies and industry standards, including without limitation the increasing shift by consumers to mobile devices from personal computers, we could lose consumers, customers or advertising inventory and our results of operations may suffer.\nThe business lines in which we currently operate and compete are characterized by rapidly-changing Internet media and marketing standards, changing technologies and platforms, frequent new product and service introductions, and changing consumer and customer demands and modes of accessing and providing information. The number of individuals who access the Internet through devices other than a personal computer, such as tablets and smartphones, has increased dramatically. The introduction of new technologies and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing technologies and services obsolete and unmarketable or require unanticipated investments in technology. If consumers find our online services difficult to access through alternative devices or our competitors develop product offerings that are better adapted to or more easily accessible through alternative devices, we may fail to capture a sufficient share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services and may fail to attract both advertisers and online traffic. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to these rapidly-changing digital media formats and platforms and other technologies, including without limitation new online and mobile technologies. We will need to enhance our existing technologies and services and develop and introduce new technologies and services to address our customers\u2019 changing demands and consumer expectations and the ways consumers access online information. If we fail to adapt successfully to such developments or timely introduce new technologies and services, we could lose consumers and customers, our expenses could increase and we could lose advertising inventory, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues or results of operations.\nOur websites, applications, widgets and other products may encounter technical problems, service interruptions or security failures.\nIn the past, our websites have experienced significant increases in traffic and our applications and widgets have experienced significant increases in use in response to interest rate movements and other business or financial news events. The number of our visitors has continued to increase over time, and we are seeking to further increase our visitor traffic. As a result, our servers must accommodate spikes in demand for our web pages in addition to potential significant growth in traffic.\nOur websites, applications, widgets and other products have in the past, and may in the future, experience slower response times or interruptions as a result of increased traffic or for other reasons. These delays and interruptions may increase in the future if our servers and infrastructure are not able to accommodate potential significant traffic growth and spikes in demand. Delays and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ninterruptions resulting from the failure to maintain service connections to our websites or applications could frustrate visitors and reduce future traffic on our online platforms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur principal communications, networking and operations equipment is located in commercial co-location data centers in Atlanta, Georgia; Denver, Colorado; and Austin, Texas, as well as at other locations and through Amazon Web Services. Additional communications, networking and operations equipment is located at our office locations in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida and Denver, Colorado, as well as other locations. Multiple system or network failures or catastrophic loss of facility involving these locations, particularly data centers, could lead to interruptions or delays in service for our websites or applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Additionally, we are dependent on third-party providers and their ability to provide safe, effective and cost-efficient hardware and operating environments. Our operations are dependent upon our ability, and our third-party providers\u2019 ability, to protect our systems against damage from fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications failures, physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, acts of terrorism, hacker attacks and other events beyond our control. If any of these events were to occur, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Although we maintain insurance to cover a variety of risks, the scope and amount of our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our losses resulting from system or security failures or other disruptions to our online operations.\nFraudulent Internet transactions, consumer identity theft, security breaches and privacy concerns could hurt our revenues and reputation.\nIf consumers experience identity theft, data security breaches or fraud after clicking through one of our websites or mobile applications to apply for credit cards on the websites of credit card issuers, mortgage or deposit products on the websites of brokers, lenders or banks, or insurance on the websites of insurance agents or carriers, or following the completion of a lead form, or as a result of the use of our Quizzle\u00ae, myBankrate\u00ae, WalletUp\u00ae, Wallaby\u00ae or other platforms or services, we may be exposed to significant liability, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation. Despite our implementation of security measures, our computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security breaches. In addition, we depend on vendors to store or process certain information, some of which may be private or include personally-identifiable information. If these vendors fail to maintain adequate information security systems, or in the event they experience a breach of their networks, and consumer information is compromised, our business, reputation or results of operations could be significantly harmed. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or consumers to disclose information in order to gain access to consumer data. Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally-identifiable information of consumers using our services could significantly harm our reputation, impair our ability to attract consumers and attract and retain our advertisers, subject us to regulatory inquiry, investigation and claims, and subject us to private claims or litigation alleging damages suffered by consumers, any of which alone or together could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nTo the extent that credit card fraud or identity theft causes a general decline in consumer confidence in online financial transactions, our revenues could decline and our reputation could be damaged. If consumers are reluctant to use our services because of concerns over data privacy or credit card fraud, our ability to generate revenues would be impaired. Our revenues would also decline if changes in industry standards, regulations or laws deterred people from using online services to conduct transactions, such as applying for credit cards, or from seeking information or services that involve the transmission of confidential information. In addition, if technology upgrades or other expenditures are required to prevent security breaches of our network, boost general consumer confidence in sharing information or conducting financial transactions using online services, or prevent credit card fraud and identity theft, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources. Further, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we use to protect consumers\u2019 and customer companies\u2019 confidential information, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur business depends on a strong brand and content, thus we will not be able to attract visitors and advertisers if we do not maintain and develop our brands and content.\nIt is critical for us to maintain and develop our brands and content so as to effectively expand our visitor base and our revenues. Our success in promoting and enhancing our brands, as well as our ability to remain relevant and competitive, depends on our success in offering high quality content, features, product offers, services and functionality. In addition, we may take actions that have the unintended consequence of harming our brand. If our actions cause consumers to question the value of our marketplace, our business and reputation may suffer. If we fail to promote our brands successfully or if visitors to our websites, users of our applications, or advertisers do not perceive our content and services to be of high quality, we may not be able to continue growing our business and attracting visitors and advertisers, which will in turn negatively impact our operating results.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur results of operations may fluctuate significantly.\nOur results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nchanges in fees paid by our customers or customer demand for our services;\n\u00b7\ntraffic levels on our websites and mobile applications, which can fluctuate significantly;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the demand for online products and services;\n\u00b7\nchanges in fee or revenue-sharing arrangements with our distribution partners;\n\u00b7\nchanges in application approval rates by our credit card issuer customers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enter into or renew key distribution agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of new advertising services by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nfailure by advertisers or their agencies to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner or at all;\n\u00b7\nfailure by our credit card customers to timely report, or to report at all, approved credit card applications for consumers that come through our websites;\n\u00b7\nchanges in access to third-party sourced consumer inquiries for insurance quotes;\n\u00b7\nfailure by our senior care customers to timely report, or to report at all, completed move-ins of the consumers that come through our websites; changes in our capital or operating expenses;\n\u00b7\nchanges in consumer confidence;\n\u00b7\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial services, senior care-related, or privacy laws or regulations, or other laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement by government regulators of such laws or regulations; and\n\u00b7\ninsurance carrier loss ratios.\nOur future revenue and results of operations are difficult to forecast due to these factors as well as other factors. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on past periods as indicators of future performance.\nRestrictive covenants in the indenture governing our outstanding senior secured notes, our revolving credit agreement or other future indebtedness may limit our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies.\nThe Senior Notes Indenture (as defined below) governing our 6.125% senior notes due 2018 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d or \u201cNotes\u201d) and our Credit Agreement contain, and any future indebtedness may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest. The Senior Notes Indenture and the Credit Agreement limit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u00b7\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments (including redemptions of subordinated indebtedness);\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u00b7\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u00b7\nmerge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nmake investments; and\n\u00b7\nchange our business operations.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Notes, the Credit Agreement or any agreement governing our future indebtedness could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event our lenders and note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we cannot assure that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.\nThe restrictions contained in the Senior Notes Indenture and the Credit Agreement could adversely affect our ability to:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nfinance our operations;\n\u00b7\nmake needed or desired capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nmake strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic alliances;\n\u00b7\nwithstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u00b7\nengage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and\n\u00b7\nplan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nThese restrictions could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement.\nRisks associated with our strategic acquisitions could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe have acquired a number of companies and assets of companies in the past and may make additional acquisitions, asset purchases and strategic investments in the future. For example, in May 2014 and December 2014, we completed the acquisition of Caring, Inc. (owner of Caring.com) and Wallaby Financial Inc., respectively and in April 2015, we completed the acquisition of Quizzle, LLC (owner of Quizzle.com). We will continue to consider acquisitions, asset purchases and joint ventures as a means of enhancing stockholder value. Our success in integrating our acquired businesses will depend upon our ability to retain key personnel, avoid diversion of management\u2019s attention from operational matters, integrate the technical operations and personnel of the acquired companies, and achieve the expected financial results, synergies and other benefits from our acquisitions.\nIn addition, future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt, costs and contingent liabilities. Integration of acquired operations may take longer, or be more costly or disruptive to our business, than originally anticipated.\nIt is also possible that expected synergies from our acquisitions may not materialize in full or at all. We may also incur costs and divert management attention through potential acquisitions that are never consummated. Future impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life recorded in connection with an acquisition, or restructuring charges, could also occur and negatively affect our results of operations.\nDespite our due diligence investigation of each business that we acquire, there may be liabilities of the acquired companies that we fail to or are unable to discover during the due diligence investigation and for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible and which could have a material and adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In connection with acquisitions, we generally seek to minimize the impact of these types of potential liabilities through the structure of the transaction or through indemnities and warranties from the seller, which may in some instances be supported by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price. However, these indemnities and warranties, if obtained, may not fully cover the liabilities due to limitations in scope, amount or duration, financial limitations of the indemnitor or warrantor, or other reasons.\nOur ability to consummate any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by the number of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands, our resources and our ability to obtain financing.\nWe depend on attracting and retaining executive officers and personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our senior management team and other skilled employees. The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or of other key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our senior management team possesses valuable knowledge about our business and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Our success and the quality of our editorial content also depend on the expertise of our editors and reporters and on their relationships with the media, financial experts and other sources of information. The loss of qualified personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIf our employees were to unionize, our operating costs would likely increase.\nOur employees are not currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement. However, we have no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future, which could increase our operating costs, force us to alter our operating methods, and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are from time to time involved in, or may in the future be subject to, claims, suits, government inquiries or investigations, and other proceedings that may have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are from time to time involved in, or may in the future be subject to, claims, suits, government inquiries or investigations, and proceedings arising from our business or the fact that we are a public company, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, privacy, consumer protection, information security, securities laws and regulations, transactions in which we are involved, data protection or law enforcement matters, tax matters, labor and employment claims, commercial claims, as well as shareholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits, and other matters. We are also at risk where we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings or from direct harm. Such claims, suits, inquiries, investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Defense costs and any resulting damage awards or settlement amounts may not be fully covered by our insurance policies. Regardless of the outcome, any such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of attention of management and other personnel, and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm, liability, penalties, or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, or requiring a change in our business practices, products or technologies, which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, accounting rules may require the Company to record a liability related to a particular matter prior to its resolution if the incurrence of a loss related to such matter becomes probable and reasonably estimable. See the description of the SEC, DOJ and CFPB investigations in Note 11 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Financial Statements in this report, as well as the risk factors set forth under \u201cRisks Related to the Restatement and Other Accounting Issues\u201d in this Item 1A.\nIn addition to litigation in the ordinary course of business, we are currently involved in litigation in which it has been alleged that we have participated in anti-competitive conduct. See the description of the Banxcorp litigation in Note 11 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Financial Statements in this report. Antitrust litigation is by its nature not in the ordinary course. Defending antitrust allegations, even if ultimately successful, can be costly and have a negative effect on our business. In addition, the relief sought by the plaintiffs in this case, if granted, could prevent Bankrate from continuing to pursue at least some aspects of its current business model, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance coverage may not be available to cover all of our potential liability and available coverage may not be sufficient to cover all claims that we may incur.\nOur ability to obtain liability insurance, its coverage levels, deductibles and premiums are all dependent on market factors, our loss history and insurers\u2019 perception of our overall risk profile. We cannot ensure that our insurance will cover all claims or that insurance coverage will be available at economically acceptable rates. Significant uninsured liabilities could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to operational risk.\nWe are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. We are also exposed to operational risk through the aspects of our business that we outsource, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business. Although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone business opportunities, and also adversely impact our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe rely on the protection of our intellectual property.\nOur intellectual property includes our unique research and editorial content of our websites, our applications, our URLs, our registered and unregistered trademarks and our print publications. We rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, and our policy and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our websites, mobile applications or print publications without authorization. A failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be subject to claims that we violated intellectual property rights of others, which even if unfounded or decided in our favor may be extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to operate.\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may in the future receive notices that claim we have misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. There may be intellectual property rights held by others, including issued or pending patents and trademarks, that cover significant aspects of our technologies, content, branding or business methods.\nBecause we license some of our data and content from other parties, we may be exposed to infringement actions if such parties do not possess the necessary proprietary rights. Generally, we obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of licensed content and obtain indemnification to cover any breach of any of these representations. However, these representations may not be accurate and the indemnification may be limited or otherwise may not be sufficient to provide adequate compensation for any breach of these representations.\nAny future infringement or other claims or prosecutions related to our intellectual property could have a material and adverse effect on our business. Defending against any of these claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to introduce new content or trademarks, develop new technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. These royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may face liability for, and may be subject to claims related to, information on our websites or mobile applications, which even if unfounded or decided in our favor may be extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to operate.\nMuch of the information published on our online platforms and in our print publications relates to the competitiveness of financial institutions\u2019 rates, products and services. We also publish editorial and other content designed to educate consumers about banking, personal finance and senior care products, and on certain of our websites provide a platform for user-generated content. If the information we provide is not accurate or is construed as misleading or outdated, consumers and others could lose confidence in our services and attempt to hold us liable for damages and government regulators could impose fines or penalties on us. We may be subjected to claims of violations of law or regulation, and claims for defamation, negligence, discrimination, invasion of personal privacy, fraud, deceptive practices, copyright or trademark infringement, conflicts of interest or other theories relating to the information we publish. We may also be exposed to similar liability in connection with content that users post to our websites through ratings, reviews, forums, blogs, comments, and other social media features. In addition, if there are errors or omissions in information we publish, consumers, individually or through consumer class actions, could seek damages from us for losses incurred if they relied on incorrect information we provided. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against providers of online services as well as print publications. The scope and amount of our insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of claims.\nWe may face liability for, and may be subject to claims related to, inaccurate advertising content provided to us, which even if unfounded or decided in our favor may be extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to operate.\nMuch of the information on our online platforms that is provided by advertisers and collected from third parties relates to the rates, costs and features for various loan, depository, insurance, personal credit and investment products offered by financial institutions, mortgage companies, investment companies, insurance companies and others participating in the personal finance marketplace, and for providers of senior care facilities. We are exposed to the risk that some advertisers may provide us, or directly post on our websites or mobile applications, (i) inaccurate information about their product rates, costs and features, or (ii) rates, costs and features that are not available to all consumers. This could cause consumers to lose confidence in the information we provide, causing certain advertisers to become dissatisfied with our services, and result in lawsuits being filed or regulatory action against us which could material and adversely affect our business or results of operations. The scope and amount of our insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of lawsuits or actions.\nOur success depends on establishing and maintaining distribution arrangements.\nOur business strategy includes the distribution of our content through the establishment of co-branded web pages with high traffic business and personal finance sections of third party online services and websites. Providing access to these co-branded web pages is a\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsignificant part of the value we offer to our advertisers. We compete with other providers of services similar to ours to maintain our current relationships with these third party online operators and establish new relationships. In addition, as we expand our personal finance content or change our services, or as these third party online operators acquire or develop their own services, some of these third party online operators may perceive us as a competitor. As a result, they may be unwilling to promote distribution of our content or services. If our distribution arrangements do not attract a sufficient number of visitors to support our current advertising model, or if we do not establish and maintain distribution arrangements on favorable economic terms, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe do not have exclusive relationships or long-term contracts with the banks, mortgage lenders, credit card issuers, insurance companies and agencies, or senior care companies that are our customers, which may limit our ability to retain these customers as participants in our marketplace and maintain the attractiveness of our services to consumers.\nWe do not have exclusive relationship with the banks, mortgage lenders, credit card issuers, insurance companies and agencies, or senior care companies whose products are advertised on our online marketplace, and thus, consumers may obtain services or products from these companies without using our services. Many of our customers also offer their products directly to consumers through agents, mass marketing campaigns or other traditional methods of distribution. In many cases, our customers also offer their products and services online, either directly to consumers or through one or more of our online competitors, or both. An inability to retain these customers as participants in our marketplace could materially and adversely affect our business, revenues and results of operations.\nOur revenue from senior living referrals is concentrated among a small number of customers.\nA significant portion of our senior living referral revenue is generated from a small number of customers. We expect that most of our senior living referral revenues will continue to depend on referral fees from a small group of customers. The loss of one of these customers could significantly reduce our senior living referral revenue. In addition, if a significant customer experiences operating issues, regulatory violations, bad publicity or other problems, the fees we receive from that customer may be materially reduced.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired.\nWe are required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include, among others, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel, or a significant adverse change in the business environment. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined. This could adversely impact our results of operations.\nUnfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect us.\nOur tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. An unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may expand to other international markets, in addition to our United Kingdom, Canada and China operations, in which we may have limited experience.\nWe have websites for consumers located in the United Kingdom, Canada and China. In the event that we expand into other international markets, we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services in those markets. Expansion into international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources, may require the attraction, retention and management of local offices or personnel, and requires us to tailor our services and information to the local market as well as to adapt to local cultures, languages, regulations and standards. Certain international markets may be slower than domestic markets in adopting the Internet as an advertising and commerce medium or in developing telecommunications or online infrastructure and so our operations in international markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment. In addition, international consumers may not adopt the Internet for personal finance content at all or as frequently as U.S. consumers.\nOur international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe face certain risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ntrade barriers and changes in trade regulations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the use of or access to the Internet;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u00b7\ncredit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\npolitical or social unrest or economic instability;\n\u00b7\nseasonal volatility in business activity;\n\u00b7\nrisks related to compliance with applicable regulations, including but not limited to anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u00b7\nrisks related to government regulation or required compliance with local laws in certain jurisdictions, including labor laws; and\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nOne or more of these factors could harm our future international operations and consequently, could harm our brand, business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf we fail to detect click-through fraud or other invalid clicks, other fraud on advertisements or unscrupulous advertisers, we could lose the confidence of our other advertisers or our customers and all or part of their business, thereby causing our business to suffer.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraudulent or other invalid clicks on our advertisements or actions with respect to our consumer inquiry sources. We may in the future have to refund revenue that our advertisers or customers have paid to us and that was later attributed to, or suspected to be caused by fraud or other invalid clicks. Fraudulent or other invalid clicks may result in us receiving advertising fees that are not the result of clicks generated by consumers. Click-through fraud occurs when a person or automated system clicks on an advertisement displayed on a website with the intent of generating the revenue share payment to the publisher rather than to view the underlying content. Action fraud occurs when on-line forms are completed with false or fictitious information in an effort to increase the compensable actions in respect of which the recipient of such information is to be compensated. We do not charge our advertisers or customers for fraudulent or certain other invalid clicks or actions when they are detected, and such fraudulent or invalid activities could negatively affect our profitability or harm our reputation. If fraudulent or other invalid clicks or actions are not detected, the affected advertisers or customers may experience a reduced return on their investment in our programs, which could lead the advertisers or customers to become dissatisfied with our campaigns, and in turn, lead to loss of advertisers or customers and the related revenue.\nWe are also exposed to the risk that advertisers who advertise on our website will advertise interest rates or other terms on a variety of financial products that they do not intend to honor. This \u201cbait and switch\u201d activity encourages consumers to contact fraudulent advertisers over legitimate advertisers because the fraudulent advertisers claim to offer better interest rates or other terms. Such activity could hurt our reputation and our brand and lead to our other advertisers becoming dissatisfied with our advertising programs, which could lead to loss of advertisers and revenue.\nFuture government regulation of the Internet is uncertain and subject to change.\nLaws and regulations that apply to online communications, commerce and advertising are continuously evolving and developing. In the United States and abroad, federal and state laws have been enacted regarding intellectual property ownership and infringement, trade secrets, the sending of unsolicited commercial email, user privacy, search engines, net neutrality, online tracking technologies, direct marketing, data security, children\u2019s privacy, sweepstakes, promotions and acceptable content and quality of goods. This legislation could: hinder growth in the use of the Internet generally; decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications, commercial and advertising medium; reduce our revenue; increase our operating expenses; or expose us to significant liabilities. Additionally, taxation of online services or electronic commerce transactions may be imposed. Any regulation imposing fees for online services or electronic commerce transactions could result in a decline in the use of online services and the viability of Internet commerce, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nLaws and regulations may limit, restrict or place additional requirements on the way we operate our business or establish and maintain our online relationships, and may subject us to claims.\nState, federal and foreign lending laws and regulations generally require accurate disclosure of the critical components of credit costs so that consumers can readily compare credit terms from various lenders. These laws and regulations also impose certain restrictions\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\non the advertisement of these credit terms. Because we are an aggregator of rate and other information regarding many financial products, including mortgages, deposits and credit cards, we may be subject to some of these laws and regulations and we may be held liable under these laws and regulations for information provided through our online services. The insurance industry and senior care industry are also subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations. Federal and state fraud and abuse laws could be applied to senior care referral sources where referral fees are funded using government funds.\nWe rely on telemarketing and email marketing conducted internally and through third parties to generate a significant number of consumer inquiries for our business. The telemarketing and email marketing services industries are subject to an increasing amount of regulation in the United States under both federal and state law. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) have issued regulations that place restrictions on telephone calls to residential and wireless telephone subscribers.\nMost of the statutes and regulations in the United States allow a private right of action for the recovery of damages or provide for enforcement by the FTC, FCC, other federal agencies, state attorneys general or state agencies permitting the recovery of significant civil or criminal penalties, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees in the event that regulations are violated. We believe that we comply with all such applicable laws and regulations, but ensure that we, or third parties that we rely on for telemarketing, email marketing and other lead generation activities, will be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times. We cannot ensure that the FTC, FCC, other federal agencies, state attorneys general, state agencies or private litigants will not attempt to hold us responsible for any unlawful acts conducted by our third party vendors or that we could successfully enforce or collect upon any indemnities provided to us by third parties, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, changes in these regulations or the interpretation thereof that further restrict our business activities could result in a material reduction in the number of consumer inquiries for our business and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe FCC amended its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d), effective in July 2012, which could increase our exposure to liability for certain types of telephonic communication with consumers. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek injunctive relief and actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. A determination that there have been violations of laws relating to our practices under the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain states have enacted, or are considering enacting, legislation that places limitations and requirements on businesses that provide referrals for senior housing. Such legislation could make the provision of our senior care services more expensive and less profitable, or prohibit the operation of those services, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe believe that we have structured our business and our online services to comply with applicable laws and regulations as are currently in effect. Because of uncertainties as to the applicability of some of these laws and regulations to online services and, more specifically, to our type of business, and considering that our business has evolved and expanded in a relatively short period of time, and will continue to evolve and develop, we may not always have been, and may not always be, in compliance with all applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to administrative enforcement actions and fines, class action lawsuits, cease and desist orders, and civil and criminal liability. If these laws and regulations are changed, or if new laws or regulations are enacted, these events could prohibit or substantially alter the content we provide on our websites and the operation of our business. Moreover, such events could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDeterioration in general economic conditions and difficult market conditions may adversely affect the financial services industry and harm our revenue opportunities, business and financial condition.\nGeneral downward economic trends, reduced availability of commercial credit and increasing unemployment negatively impact the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit. Concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy in the past have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other. These macroeconomic conditions have affected and may in the future negatively affect our business and financial condition. Economic pressure on consumers and businesses and declining confidence in the financial markets would likely cause a decrease in the demand for advertising financial products and services. Additionally, advertising expenditures tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Since we derive most of our revenues from advertising, deterioration in economic conditions could cause decreases in or delays in advertising spending and would be likely to reduce our revenue and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes and Credit Agreement.\nWe have, and will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, our total indebtedness was $297.6 million, net of unamortized discount comprised of the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had no loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $20.8 million. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to invest in our business at an appropriate level, thereby making it more difficult to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have other important consequences to you and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to other contractual and commercial commitments;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u00b7\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, changes in government regulation and changes in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for us to react quickly to, changing conditions;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u00b7\nexpose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of increases in interest rates; and\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on the Notes and amounts outstanding from time to time under the New Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Credit Agreement each contain, and the agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful or if successful, could adversely impact our business.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the Notes, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Our debt service obligations are currently $18.4 million per year. In addition, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility described below, which when drawn in the future would increase the amount of our current debt service obligations. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to fund our day-to-day operations or to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Senior Notes Indenture and the Credit Agreement each restrict, and any of our other future debt agreements may restrict, our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIn addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which may not be guarantors of the Notes or guarantors of our other indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the Notes, our obligations from time to time under the Credit Agreement or any future indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or under the Credit Agreement or to make funds available for such purposes. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Although the Senior Notes Indenture and the Credit Agreement\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndo, and other future debt agreements may, limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are, or in the case of future debt agreements may be, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, holders of Notes or our other indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDespite restrictions in the Senior Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility, we may still be able to incur additional indebtedness. This could increase the risks associated with our leverage, including the ability to service our indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur additional indebtedness pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture and the Credit Agreement in the future, including additional secured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we were able to incur up to an additional $414.1 million of indebtedness, of which up to $100.0 million could be secured indebtedness, pursuant to the incurrence tests described in the Senior Notes Indenture and Credit Agreement. Although covenants under the Senior Notes Indenture and the Credit Agreement limit our ability and the ability of our present and future subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. The Senior Notes Indenture and the Credit Agreement also allow us to incur certain additional secured and unsecured debt and allow our foreign restricted subsidiaries and our future unrestricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt, which would be structurally senior to the Notes and amounts outstanding from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Credit Agreement do not prohibit us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined therein. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risk associated with substantial additional indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt will increase.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Shares of Our Securities\nThe Apax Holders (defined below) control a significant interest in us and its interests may conflict with or differ from stockholder interests.\nTo our knowledge, Ben Holding S.\u00e0 r.l., which is beneficially owned by Apax US VII, L.P., Apax Europe VII-A, L.P., Apax Europe VII-B, L.P. and Apax Europe VII-1, L.P. (the \u201cApax Holders\u201d), currently owns 36% of our common stock. As a result of its ownership, the Apax Holders have the power, and pursuant to the stockholders agreement, their majority-owned subsidiary Ben Holding S.\u00e0 r.l. has the contractual right, to nominate a number of directors equal to 30% of the total number of directors. Accordingly, the Apax Holders have significant influence over any decision to approve or reject any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or our stockholders, including significant corporate transactions such as business combinations. In addition, following a reduction of the equity owned by the Apax Holders to below 30% of our outstanding common stock, the Apax Holders, through Ben Holding S.\u00e0 r.l., will retain the right to designate a certain number of designees for our board of directors until the Apax Holders\u2019 ownership percentage falls below 5%. The Apax holders\u2019 ability to significantly influence or effectively control our decisions will continue even after selling a portion of their interests in us.\nThe interests of the Apax Holders could conflict with or differ from stockholder interests. For example, the concentration of ownership held by the Apax Holders could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of the Company or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination that other stockholders may otherwise support, or approve such transactions notwithstanding opposition from other stockholders. Additionally, Apax Partners is in the business of advising on investments in companies the Apax Holders hold, and they or other funds advised by Apax Partners may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. They may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.", "PERMNO": 86895, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "RATE"}
