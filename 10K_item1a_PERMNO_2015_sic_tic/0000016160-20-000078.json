RISK FACTORS\nOur business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of the known factors that may materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. They should be considered carefully, in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities. Additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us, or that we are aware of but currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMarket prices of wholesale shell eggs are volatile, and decreases in these prices can adversely impact our revenues and profits.\nOur operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which fluctuate widely and are outside our control. As a result, our prior performance should not be presumed to be an accurate indication of future performance. Under certain circumstances, small increases in production, or small decreases in demand, within the industry might have a large adverse effect on shell egg prices. Low shell egg prices adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nMarket prices for wholesale shell eggs have been volatile and cyclical. Shell egg prices have risen in the past during periods of high demand such as the COVID-19 pandemic and periods when high protein diets are popular. Shell egg prices have also risen in the past during periods of constrained supply, such as the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, which we believe, based on published industry estimates, impacted approximately 12% of the national flock of laying hens. During times when prices are high, the egg industry has typically geared up to produce more eggs primarily by increasing the number of layers, ultimately resulting in an oversupply of eggs, which was subsequently followed by a period of lower prices.\nAs discussed above in Item 1. Business - Seasonality, seasonal fluctuations impact shell egg prices. Therefore, comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons.\nA decline in consumer demand for shell eggs can negatively impact our business.\nWe believe fast food restaurant consumption, high protein diet trends, industry advertising campaigns, and the improved nutritional reputation of eggs (related to better scientific understanding of the role of cholesterol in diets) have all contributed to shell egg demand. However, it is possible that the demand for shell eggs will decline in the future. Adverse publicity relating to health concerns and changes in the perception of the nutritional value of shell eggs, changes in consumer views regarding consumption of animal-based products, as well as movement away from high protein diets, could adversely affect demand for shell eggs, which would have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nFeed costs are volatile and increases in these costs can adversely impact our results of operations.\nFeed cost represents the largest element of our shell egg (farm) production cost, ranging from 55% to 60% of total farm production cost in the last five fiscal years. Although feed ingredients are available from a number of sources, we do not have control over the prices of the ingredients we purchase, which are affected by weather, various supply and demand factors, transportation and storage costs, speculators, and agricultural, energy and trade policies in the U.S. and internationally. For example, a severe drought in the summer of 2012 and resulting damage to the national corn and soybean crops resulted in high and volatile feed costs. Increases in feed costs unaccompanied by increases in the selling price of eggs can have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and cash flow. Alternatively, low feed costs can encourage industry overproduction, possibly resulting in lower egg prices and lower revenue.\nEvents beyond our control such as pandemics (including the COVID-19 outbreak), extreme weather and natural disasters could negatively impact our business.\nSince early 2020, the coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") outbreak, characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has caused significant disruptions in international and U.S. economies and markets. The potential impact of COVID-19 on our business in the future is uncertain. The pandemic, or similar disease outbreaks in the future, may depress demand for shell eggs due to quarantines or restrictions on public interactions that would limit the ability of consumers to purchase shell eggs. The pandemic, or similar disease outbreaks in the future, may disrupt our supply chain and operations at our facilities. If a significant percentage of our workforce, or the workforce of our suppliers or transportation providers, is unable to work because of illness or government restrictions, our operations would be negatively impacted, potentially materially. Pandemics or disease outbreaks may also impact hens or the food supply, although to date, there is no known indication that COVID-19 affects hens or can be transferred through the food supply.\nFire, bioterrorism, pandemic, extreme weather or natural disasters, including droughts, floods, excessive cold or heat, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of our flocks, decrease production or availability of feed ingredients, or interfere with our operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, discharges from overtopped or breached wastewater treatment lagoons, damage to our production and processing facilities, labor shortages or disruption of transportation channels, among other things. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nPressure from animal rights groups regarding the treatment of animals may subject us to additional costs to conform our practices to comply with developing standards or subject us to marketing costs to defend challenges to our current practices and protect our image with our customers. In particular, changes in customer preferences and new legislation have accelerated an increase in demand for cage-free eggs, which increases uncertainty in our business and increases our costs.\nWe and many of our customers face pressure from animal rights groups, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and the Humane Society of the United States, to require companies that supply food products to operate their business in a manner that treats animals in conformity with certain standards developed or approved by these groups. In general, we may incur additional costs to conform our practices to address these standards or to defend our existing practices and protect our image with our customers. The standards promoted by these groups change over time, but typically require minimum cage space for hens, among other requirements, and some of these groups have led successful legislative efforts to ban any form of caged housing in various states. As discussed in Item 1. Business - Government Regulation, several states have passed minimum space and/or cage-free requirements for hens, and other states are considering such requirements. In addition, in recent years, many large restaurant chains, food service companies and grocery chains, including our largest customers, announced goals to transition to an exclusively cage-free egg supply chain by specified future dates, in some cases subject to available supply, affordability and consumer demand.\nChanging our infrastructure and operating procedures to conform to customer demands and new laws has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs, including capital and operating cost increases. The USDA reported that the estimated cage-free flock is 78.4 million hens as of June 2020 which is approximately 25% of the total U.S. hen population. According to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service approximately 71% of the U.S. laying flock would have to be in cage-free production by 2026 to meet projected demand from the retailers, foodservice providers and food manufacturers that have made promises to transition to cage-free eggs. The United Egg Producers, a nation-wide egg farmer cooperative, has estimated that the cost to build farms compliant with cage-free standards is $45 a bird. Based on that figure, such an increase in the size of the cage-free flock would require an estimated industry-wide investment of approximately $6.7 billion.\nIn response to our customers' announced goals and increased legal requirements for cage-free eggs, we increased capital expenditures to increase our cage-free production capacity. Our customers typically do not commit to long-term purchases of specific quantities or type of eggs with us, and as a result, we cannot predict with any certainty which types of eggs they will require us to supply in future periods. The ongoing production of cage-free eggs is more costly than the production of conventional eggs, and these higher production costs contribute to the higher prices of cage-free eggs compared with conventional eggs. Many consumers prefer to buy less expensive conventional shell eggs. These consumer preferences may in turn influence our customers\u2019 future needs for cage-free eggs. Due to these uncertainties, we may over-estimate future demand for cage-free eggs, which could increase our costs unnecessarily, or we may under-estimate future demand for cage-free eggs, which could harm us competitively. We are enhancing our focus on cage-free capacity when considering acquisition opportunities, as discussed in more detail below.\nDue to the cyclical nature of our business, our financial results fluctuate from year to year.\nThe shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss. In the past, during periods of high profitability, shell egg producers tended to increase the number of layers in production with a resulting increase in the supply of shell eggs, which generally caused a drop in shell egg prices until supply and demand returned to balance. As a result, our financial results from year to year vary significantly.\nWe purchase a portion of the shell eggs we sell from others, and our ability to obtain such eggs at prices and in quantities acceptable to us could fluctuate.\nWe purchased from other producers approximately 13% and 16% of the total number of shell eggs we sold in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. As the wholesale price for shell eggs increases, our cost to acquire shell eggs from others increases. There can be no assurance that we can continue to acquire shell eggs in sufficient quantities and at satisfactory prices, and our inability to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nOur acquisition growth strategy subjects us to various risks.\nAs discussed in Item 1. Business - Growth Strategy, we plan to pursue a growth strategy that includes selective acquisitions of other companies engaged in the production and sale of shell eggs, with a priority on those that will facilitate our ability to expand our cage-free shell egg production capabilities in key locations and markets. The number of existing companies with cage-free capacity that we may be available to purchase is limited, as most production of shell eggs by other companies in our markets currently does not meet customer or legal requirements to be designated as cage-free.\nAcquisitions require capital resources and can divert management\u2019s attention from our existing business. Acquisitions also entail an inherent risk that we could become subject to contingent or other liabilities, including liabilities arising from events or conduct prior to our acquisition of a business that were unknown to us at the time of acquisition. We could incur significantly greater expenditures in integrating an acquired business than we anticipated at the time of its purchase. We may over-estimate or under-estimate the demand for cage-free eggs, which could cause our acquisition strategy to be less-than-optimal for our future growth and profitability.\nWe cannot assure you that we:\n\u2022 will identify suitable acquisition candidates;\n\u2022 can consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms;\n\u2022 can successfully integrate an acquired business into our operations; or\n\u2022 can successfully manage the operations of an acquired business.\nNo assurance can be given that companies we acquire in the future will contribute positively to our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, federal antitrust laws require regulatory approval of acquisitions that exceed certain threshold levels of significance, and we cannot guarantee that such approvals would be obtained.\nThe consideration we pay in connection with any acquisition affects our financial results. If we pay cash, we could be required to use a portion of our available cash to consummate the acquisition. To the extent we issue shares of our Common Stock, existing stockholders may be diluted. In addition, acquisitions may result in additional debt.\nOur largest customers historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales volume. Accordingly, our business may be adversely affected by the loss of, or reduced purchases by, one or more of our large customers.\nOur top three customers accounted for an aggregate of 51.1%, 52.2% and 51.7% of net sales dollars for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc. (including Sam's Club), accounted for 32.1%, 33.7% and 33.2% of net sales dollars for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. H-E-B, LP accounted for 10.1% of net sales dollars for fiscal 2020. Although we have established long-term relationships with most of our customers who continue to purchase from us based on our ability to service their needs, they are free to acquire shell eggs from other sources. If, for any reason, one or more of our large customers were to purchase significantly less of our shell eggs in the future or terminate their purchases from us, and we are not able to sell our shell eggs to new customers at comparable levels, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with applicable governmental regulations, including environmental regulations, could harm our operating results, financial condition, and reputation. Further, we may incur significant costs to comply with any such regulations.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to grading, quality control, labeling, sanitary control, waste disposal, and other areas of our business. As a fully-integrated shell egg producer, our shell egg facilities are subject to regulation and inspection by the USDA, EPA, and FDA, as well as state and local health and agricultural agencies, among others. All of our shell egg production and feed mill facilities are subject to FDA regulation and inspections. In addition, rules are often proposed that, if adopted as proposed, could increase our costs.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, disposal, and remediation of hazardous materials. Under these laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities, including, but not limited to pollution/wastewater discharge permits.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or fail to obtain necessary permits, we could be subject to significant fines and penalties or other sanctions, our reputation could be harmed, and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, because these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent, it is possible that we will be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such laws and regulations in the future.\nShell eggs and shell egg products are susceptible to microbial contamination, and we may be required to, or we may voluntarily, recall contaminated products.\nShell eggs and shell egg products are vulnerable to contamination by pathogens such as Salmonella. The Company maintains policies and procedures designed to comply with the complex rules and regulations governing egg production, such as The Final Egg Rule issued by the FDA \"Prevention of Salmonella Enteritidis in Shell Eggs During Production, Storage, and Transportation\u201d, and the FDA\u2019s Food Safety Modernization Act. Shipment of contaminated products, even if inadvertent, could result in a violation of law and lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls and scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition, products purchased from other producers could contain contaminants that might be inadvertently redistributed by us. As such, we might decide or be required to recall a product if we or regulators believe it poses a potential health risk. We do not maintain insurance to cover recall losses. Any product recall could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products, adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAgricultural risks, including outbreaks of avian disease, could harm our business.\nOur shell egg production activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Unusual or extreme weather conditions, disease and pests can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of shell eggs we produce and distribute. The Company maintains controls and procedures to reduce the risk of exposing our flocks to harmful diseases; however, despite these efforts, outbreaks of avian disease can and do still occur and may adversely impact the health of our flocks. An outbreak of avian disease could have a material adverse impact on our financial results by increasing government restrictions on the sale and distribution of our products and requiring us to euthanize the affected layers. Negative publicity from an outbreak within our industry can negatively impact customer perception, even if the outbreak does not directly impact our flocks. If a substantial portion of our layers or production facilities are affected by any of these factors in any given quarter or year, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is highly competitive.\nThe production and sale of fresh shell eggs, which accounted for virtually all of our net sales in recent years, is intensely competitive. We compete with a large number of competitors that may prove to be more successful than we are in marketing and selling shell eggs. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with any or all of these companies. Increased competition could result in price reductions, greater cyclicality, reduced margins and loss of market share, which would negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our management team, and the loss of any key member of this team may adversely affect the implementation of our business plan in a timely manner.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued service of our senior management team. The loss or interruption of service of one or more of our key executive officers could adversely affect our ability to manage our operations effectively and/or pursue our growth strategy. We have not entered into any employment or non-compete agreements with any of our executive officers nor do we carry any significant key-man life insurance coverage on any such persons. Competition could cause us to lose talented employees, and unplanned turnover could deplete institutional knowledge and result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees.\nLabor shortages or increases in labor costs could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nLabor is a primary component of our farm production costs. Our success is dependent upon recruiting, motivating, and retaining staff to operate our farms. Approximately 74% of our employees are paid at hourly rates, often in entry-level positions. While the majority are paid at rates above the federal minimum wage requirements, any significant increase in local, state or federal minimum wage requirements could increase our labor costs. In addition, any regulatory changes requiring us to provide additional employee benefits or mandating increases in other employee-related costs, such as unemployment insurance or workers compensation, would increase our costs. A shortage in the labor pool, which may be caused by competition from other employers, the remote locations of many of our farms, or changes in immigration laws, particularly in times of lower unemployment, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. A shortage of labor available to us could cause our farms to operate with reduced staff, which could negatively impact our production capacity and could require us to increase wages to attract labor. Accordingly, any significant labor shortages or increases in our labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are controlled by the family of our late founder, Fred R. Adams, Jr. and, after the settlement of Mr. Adams' estate, we expect to be controlled by Adolphus B. Baker, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.\nFred R. Adams, Jr., our Founder and Chairman Emeritus died on March 29, 2020. Mr. Adams' estate, his son-in-law, Adolphus B. Baker, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Mr. Baker's spouse and her three sisters (who are Mr. Adams' four daughters) beneficially own, directly or indirectly through related entities, 100% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock, controlling approximately 52.5% of the total voting power of the Company. Additionally, such persons and Mrs. Adams also have additional voting power due to beneficial ownership of Common Stock, directly or indirectly through related entities, resulting in family voting control of approximately 65.6% of the total voting power of the Company.\nMr. Baker and Mrs. Adams share voting power over 100% of the Class A Common Stock and Mr. Adams\u2019 beneficially owned Common Stock, and we expect the Company will continue to be controlled by Mrs. Adams and Mr. Baker, acting jointly, until the settlement of Mr. Adams' estate. After the settlement of Mr. Adams\u2019 estate, we expect there will be a change of control of the Company to Mr. Baker as the sole managing member of the family limited liability company that owns all of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock.\nWe are and, after the settlement of Mr. Adams\u2019 estate we expect to continue to be, a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in the NASDAQ\u2019s listing standards. Accordingly, we are and we expect to continue to be exempt from certain requirements of NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance listing standards, including the requirement to maintain a majority of independent directors on our board of directors and the requirements regarding the determination of compensation of executive officers and nomination of directors by independent directors.\nWe understand that the Adams and Baker families intend to retain ownership of a sufficient amount of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock to assure continued ownership of more than 50% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock. As a result of this ownership, the Adams and Baker families have the ability to exert substantial influence over matters requiring action by our stockholders, including amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, the election and removal of directors, and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other corporate transactions. Delaware law provides that the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares entitled to vote must approve certain fundamental corporate transactions such as a merger, consolidation and sale of all or substantially all of a corporation\u2019s assets; accordingly, such a transaction involving the Company and requiring shareholder approval cannot be effected without the approval of the Adams and Baker families. Such ownership will make an unsolicited acquisition of the Company more difficult and discourage certain types of transactions involving a change of control of our Company, including transactions in which the holders of Common Stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. The Adams and Baker families\u2019 controlling ownership of our capital stock may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nSales, or the availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our Common Stock could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nFollowing the settlement of Mr. Adams' estate, we expect Mrs. Adams, Mr. Adams\u2019 daughters, and certain other related entities (the \u201cStockholder Parties\u201d) will hold approximately 12 million shares of Common Stock (the \"Subject Shares\") that are subject to an Agreement Regarding Common Stock (the \"Agreement\"), which is an exhibit to this report.\nPursuant to the Agreement, the Company filed a Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus dated October 9, 2018, pursuant to which these Subject Shares will be eligible for sale in the amounts and on the terms described in the Agreement. The Stockholder Parties are working on plans to arrange for the payment of estate taxes on Mr. Adams' estate as well as liquidity. We understood those plans may involve the sale of up to 6.0 million shares of Common Stock contemplated under the Agreement. Federal estate taxes are due nine months after the date of death, although a discretionary extension of the due date to pay the federal estate taxes for up to an additional 12 months may be granted by the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Agreement provides that if any Stockholder Party intends to sell any of the Subject Shares, such party must give the Company a right of first refusal to purchase all or any of such shares. The price payable by the Company to purchase shares pursuant to the exercise of the right of first refusal will reflect a 6% discount to the then-current market price based on the 20 business-day volume weighted average price. If the Company does not exercise its right of first refusal and purchase the shares offered, such Stockholder Party will, subject to the approval of a special committee of independent directors of the Board of Directors, be permitted to sell the shares not purchased by the Company pursuant to a Company registration statement, Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, or another manner of sale agreed to by the Company.\nAlthough pursuant to the Agreement the Company will have a right of first refusal to purchase all or any of those shares, the Company may elect not to exercise its rights of first refusal, and if so such shares would be eligible for sale pursuant to the foregoing registration rights or pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. Sales, or the availability for sale, of a large number of shares of our Common Stock could result in a decline in the market price of our Common Stock.\nCurrent and future litigation could expose us to significant liabilities and adversely affect our business reputation.\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and although we believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters, we may incur liabilities due to adverse judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. For a discussion of legal proceedings see Item 3 below. Such lawsuits are expensive to defend, divert management\u2019s attention, and may result in significant adverse judgments or settlements. Legal proceedings may expose us to negative publicity, which could adversely affect our business reputation and customer preference for our products and brands.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other assets could negatively affect our results of operations or net worth.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of business acquisitions over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of May 30, 2020, we had $35.5 million of goodwill. While we believe the current carrying value of this goodwill is not impaired, future goodwill impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period or our net worth.\nThe loss of any registered trademark or other intellectual property could enable other companies to compete more effectively with us.\nWe utilize intellectual property in our business. For example, we own the trademarks Farmhouse Eggs\u00ae, 4Grain\u00ae, Sunups\u00ae, and Sunny Meadow\u00ae. We produce and market Egg-Land\u2019s Best\u00ae and Land O\u2019 Lakes\u00ae under license agreements with EB. We have invested a significant amount of money in establishing and promoting our trademarked brands. The loss or expiration of any intellectual property could enable our competitors to compete more effectively with us by allowing them to make and sell products substantially similar to those we offer. This could negatively impact our ability to produce and sell those products, thereby adversely affecting our operations.\nFailure of our information technology systems or software, or a security breach of those systems, could adversely affect day-to-day operations and decision making processes and have an adverse effect on our performance.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems, which we rely on to effectively manage our business data, communications, logistics, accounting and other business processes. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain an appropriate technology environment, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including systems failures, viruses, ransomware, security breaches or cyber incidents such as intentional cyber-attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises.\nA security breach of such information could result in damage to our reputation and our relations with our customers or employees. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 20598, "SIC": 200, "TIC": "CALM"}
