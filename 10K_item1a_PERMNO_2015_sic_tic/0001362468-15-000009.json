{"cik": "1362468", "company": "Allegiant Travel CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Allegiant\nIncreases in fuel prices or unavailability of fuel would harm our business and profitability.\nFuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses, representing approximately 39.6 percent, 45.8 percent and 48.7 percent during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Significant increases in fuel costs have negatively affected our operating results in the past and future fuel cost volatility could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBoth the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors and events occurring throughout the world over which we have no control. Meteorological events may also result in short-term disruptions in the fuel supply. Aircraft fuel availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for heating oil, gasoline, and other petroleum products. Because of the effect of these events on the price and availability of aircraft fuel, our ability to control this cost is limited and the price and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Due to the high percentage of our operating costs represented by fuel, a relatively small increase in the price of fuel could have a significantly negative impact on our operating costs. A fuel supply shortage or higher fuel prices could possibly result in curtailment of our service during the period affected.\nWe have made a business decision not to purchase financial derivatives to hedge against increases in the cost of fuel. This decision may make our operating results more vulnerable to the impact of fuel price increases.\nUnfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect travel from our markets to our leisure destinations.\nThe airline industry is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Unfavorable U.S. economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced discretionary spending for leisure travel. Unfavorable economic conditions could impact demand for airline travel in our small and medium-sized cities or to our leisure destinations. During difficult economic times, we may be unable to raise prices in response to fuel cost increases, labor, or other operating costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an accident or new regulations affecting aircraft in our fleet.\nAs of February 2, 2015, our operating fleet consists of 53 MD-80 series aircraft, 11 A320 series aircraft, and six Boeing 757-200 aircraft. All of our aircraft were acquired used and range from 10 to 29 years from their manufacture date at February 2, 2015.\nAn accident involving one of our aircraft, even if fully insured, could cause a public perception that we are less safe or reliable than other airlines, which would harm our business. Further, there is no assurance that the amount of insurance we carry would be sufficient to protect us from material loss. Because we are smaller than most airlines, an accident would likely adversely affect us to a greater degree than a larger, more established airline.\nThe FAA could suspend or restrict the use of our aircraft in the event of actual or perceived mechanical problems, whether involving our aircraft or another U.S. or foreign airline\u2019s aircraft, while it conducts its own investigation. Our business could also be significantly harmed if the public avoids flying our aircraft due to an adverse perception of the aircraft we utilize or associated engine types because of safety concerns or other problems, whether real or perceived, or in the event of an accident involving these aircraft or associated engine types.\nIncreased labor costs could result from industry profitability and could be impacted by labor-related disruptions.\nLabor costs constitute a significant percentage of our total operating costs and are our largest non-fuel cost. Pressure to increase compensation rates often follows periods of profitability. Our continuing high operating margins and the high levels of profitability in the airline industry are likely to increase our compensation costs as we seek to retain our employees and compete against other airlines for qualified personnel.\nFurther, we have three employee groups (pilots, flight attendants, and flight dispatchers) who have elected union representation. These groups represent a majority of our employees. We are currently in negotiations for initial collective bargaining agreements with the unions representing each of these employee groups. Union contracts could also put pressure on our labor costs in the long-term.\nIf we are unable to reach agreement on the terms of collective bargaining agreements in the future, or we experience wide-spread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our operations and future results.\nOur substantial indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial health.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $593.1 million of indebtedness outstanding. Our substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences for our investors. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, future business opportunities, or other purposes, such as funding our working capital and capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business and industry in which we operate.\nSubject to restrictions in the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes, we may incur additional indebtedness, including additional secured debt, which could increase the risks associated with our already substantial indebtedness.\nThe indenture governing our senior unsecured notes contains various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions.\nThe indenture governing our senior unsecured notes imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or restrict, among other things, our ability, and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments (including paying dividends on, redeeming, repurchasing, or retiring our capital stock);\n\u2022\nmake investments; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications which are described in the indenture we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At maturity or in the event of an acceleration of payment obligations, we may be unable to pay our outstanding indebtedness with our cash and cash equivalents then on hand. In such event, we would be required to seek alternative sources of funding, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, terms as favorable as our current agreements, or at all. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or find alternative means of financing our operations, we may be required to curtail our operations or take other actions that are inconsistent with our current business practices or strategy.\nWe rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and any failure of these systems could harm our business.\nWe depend on automated systems to operate our business, including our air reservation system, our telecommunication systems, our website, and other automated systems. Our continuing work on enhancing the capabilities of our automated systems could increase the risk of automation failures. Any failure by us to handle our automation needs could negatively affect our internet sales (on which we rely heavily) and customer service, and result in lost revenues and increased costs.\nOur website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver necessary functionality to support our operations. Our automated systems cannot be completely protected against events that are beyond our control, such as natural disasters, telecommunications failures, or computer viruses. Although we have implemented security measures and have disaster recovery plans in place, we cannot assure investors that these measures are adequate to prevent disruptions. Substantial or repeated website, reservations system, or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services. Any disruption to these systems could result in the loss of important data, loss of revenue, increase in expenses, and generally harm our business.\nWe receive, retain, and transmit certain personal information about our customers. Our on-line operations also rely on the secure transmission of this customer data. We use third-party systems, software, and tools in order to protect the customer data we obtain through the course of our business. Although we use these security measures to protect this customer data, a\ncompromise of our physical or network security systems through a cyber-security attack would create the risk that our customers\u2019 personal information might be obtained by unauthorized persons. A compromise in our security systems could adversely affect our reputation, disrupt operations, and could also result in litigation or the imposition of penalties. In addition, it could be costly to remediate. The way businesses handle customer data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation typically intended to protect the privacy of customer data received, retained, and transmitted. We could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with existing rules or practices, or if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices. These privacy developments are difficult to anticipate and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur maintenance costs may increase as our fleet ages.\nIn general, the cost to maintain aircraft increases as they age and exceeds the cost to maintain newer aircraft. FAA regulations, including the Aging Aircraft Airworthiness Directives, require additional and enhanced maintenance inspections for older aircraft. These regulations can directly impact the frequency of inspections as an aircraft ages, and vary by aircraft or engine type depending on the unique characteristics of each aircraft and/or engine.\nIn addition, we may be required to comply with any future law changes, regulations, or airworthiness directives. We cannot assure investors our maintenance costs will not exceed our expectations.\nWe believe our aircraft are and will continue to be mechanically reliable. We cannot assure our aircraft will continue to be sufficiently reliable over longer periods of time. Furthermore, given the age of our fleet, any public perception that our aircraft are less than completely reliable could have an adverse effect on our bookings and profitability.\nOur business is heavily dependent on the attractiveness of our leisure destinations and a reduction in demand for air travel to these markets could harm our business.\nA substantial proportion of our scheduled flights have Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix, Tampa/St. Petersburg, Los Angeles, or Punta Gorda as either their destination or origin. Our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation to one or more of these markets, or our other leisure destinations, such as adverse changes in local economic conditions, negative public perception of the particular city, significant price increases, or the impact of future terrorist attacks or natural disasters.\nExtreme weather can cause flight disruptions, and, during periods of storms or adverse weather, fog, low temperatures or similar weather conditions, our flights may be canceled or significantly delayed. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and Superstorm Sandy, in particular, caused severe disruption to air travel in the affected areas and adversely affected airlines operating in those areas. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our leisure destinations, due to adverse weather or otherwise, could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant number of our flights and, as a result, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with facilities and services that are integral to our business.\nWe have entered into agreements with third-party contractors to provide certain facilities and services required for our operations, such as aircraft maintenance, ground handling, baggage services, and ticket counter space. Our reliance on others to provide essential services on our behalf also gives us less control over costs and the efficiency, timeliness and quality of contract services.\nWe also rely on the owners of aircraft under contract, and on the lessee under aircraft leases, to be able to deliver, or redeliver, aircraft in accordance with the terms of executed agreements and on a timely basis. Our planned initiation of service with these aircraft in future years could be adversely affected if the third parties fail to perform as contracted.\nOur business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel.\nOur business depends upon the efforts of our chief executive officer, Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., and a small number of senior management and operating personnel. We do not currently maintain key-man life insurance on Mr. Gallagher or any other executives. We may have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and, therefore, the loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business.\nRisks Associated with the Airline and Travel Industry\nThe airline industry is highly competitive and future competition in our under-served markets could harm our business.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive. The small cities we serve on a scheduled basis have traditionally attracted considerably less attention from our potential competitors than larger markets, and in most of our small city markets, we are the only provider of nonstop service to our leisure destinations. We have more recently added service to medium-sized cities which we perceive to be under-served for nonstop service to our leisure destinations. It is possible other airlines will begin to provide nonstop services to and from these markets, or otherwise target these markets. An increase in the amount of direct or indirect competition could cause us to reconsider service to affected markets and could harm our profitability.\nA future act of terrorism, the threat of such acts, or escalation of U.S. military involvement overseas could adversely affect our industry.\nEven if not directed at the airline industry, a future act of terrorism, the threat of such acts or escalation of U.S. military involvement overseas could have an adverse effect on the airline industry. In the event of a terrorist attack, the industry would likely experience significantly reduced demand for travel services. These actions, or consequences resulting from these actions, would likely harm our business and the airline and travel industry.\nChanges in government laws and regulations imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs.\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements, both domestically and internationally, that involve significant costs. In the last several years, the FAA has issued a number of directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that have required us to make significant expenditures. FAA requirements cover, among other things, retirement of older aircraft, fleet integration of newer aircraft, security measures, collision avoidance systems, airborne windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement, weight and payload limits, assumed average passenger weight, and increased inspection and maintenance procedures to be conducted on aging aircraft. The future cost of complying with these and other laws, rules and regulations, including new federal legislative and DOT regulatory requirements in the consumer-protection area, cannot be predicted and could significantly increase our costs of doing business.\nFAA aging-aircraft regulations obligate aircraft design approval holders (typically the aircraft manufacturer or its successor) to establish a limit of validity (\"LOV\") of the engineering data that supports the aircraft\u2019s structural maintenance program, demonstrate that widespread fatigue damage will not occur in aircraft of that type prior to reaching LOV, and establish or revise airworthiness limitations applicable to that aircraft type to include LOV. Once an LOV has been established for a given aircraft type, LOV-related maintenance actions must be incorporated into the operator\u2019s maintenance program, and commercial operation of the aircraft beyond the LOV is prohibited unless an extended LOV is obtained for the aircraft. Based on the LOV established for MD-80 aircraft, the number of cycles on our MD-80 aircraft, and our annual usage of these aircraft, we do not believe the LOV rules will limit use of our MD-80 aircraft before we retire them from our fleet in years to come. Nevertheless, it is not yet possible to predict the future cost of complying with aging aircraft requirements.\nEffective in early 2011, the DOT adopted revisions and expansions to a variety of its consumer-protection regulations. We could be subject to fines or other enforcement actions if the DOT believes we are not in compliance with these rules. Even if our practices were found to be in compliance with the DOT rules, we could incur substantial costs defending our practices. In addition, the DOT has, under active consideration, new consumer-protection regulations which could impact our costs and revenues if and when the new regulations become effective.\nIn November 2013, the FAA proposed revisions to the method by which air carriers calculate and control aircraft weight-and-balance. The proposal is based on a continuing increase in the average weight of persons in the United States. If the revisions are adopted as proposed by the FAA, the ability of carriers to rely on average weights for this purpose will be complicated significantly, additional costs may result, and we may be required to carry less than full loads on certain flights.\nIn 2015, Congress may consider legislation that could increase the amount of FET and/or one or more of the other government fees imposed on air travel. By increasing the overall price charged to passengers, such action could lessen the demand for air travel or force carriers to lower fares to maintain demand. Additionally, federal funding to airports and/or airport bond financing could be affected through future deficit reduction legislation, which could result in higher fees, rates, and charges at many of the airports we serve.\nIn the past, legislation to address climate change issues has been introduced in the U.S. Congress, including a proposal to require transportation fuel producers and importers to acquire market-based allowances to offset the emissions resulting from combustion of their fuels. We cannot predict whether this or any similar legislation will be introduced or pass the Congress or, if enacted into law, how it would apply to the airline industry. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded that current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and welfare. The EPA's finding could ultimately result in strict regulation of commercial aircraft emissions, as has taken effect for operations within the European Union under EU legislation. Binding international restrictions adopted under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization (a specialized agency of the United Nations) may become effective within several years. These developments and any additional legislation or regulations addressing climate change are likely to increase our costs of doing business in the future and the increases could be material.\nWith respect to aging aircraft, aircraft weight-and-balance, consumer protection, climate change, taxation, and other matters affecting the airline industry, whether the source of new requirements is legislative or regulatory, increased costs will adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to pass the costs on to our customers or adjust our operations.\nAirlines are often affected by factors beyond their control, including air traffic congestion, weather conditions, increased security measures, and the outbreak of disease, any of which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nLike other airlines, we are subject to delays caused by factors beyond our control, including air traffic congestion at airports and en route, adverse weather conditions, increased security measures, and the outbreak of disease. Delays frustrate passengers and increase costs, which in turn could affect profitability. During periods of fog, snow, rain, storms or other adverse weather conditions, flights may be cancelled or significantly delayed. Cancellations or delays due to weather conditions, traffic control problems, and breaches in security could harm our operating results and financial condition. An outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or H1N1 virus (swine flu), could have a material adverse impact on the airline industry. Any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of an outbreak of disease or other travel advisories could dampen demand for our services even if not applicable to our markets. Resulting decreases in passenger volume would harm our load factors, could increase our cost per passenger and adversely affect our profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Stock Price\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nfuel price volatility, and the effect of economic and geopolitical factors and worldwide oil supply and consumption on fuel availability\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our competitors, the airline industry, or the economy in general\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings\n\u2022\nmedia reports and publications about the safety of our aircraft or the aircraft types we operate\n\u2022\nnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our business strategy\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock or other actions by investors with significant shareholdings\n\u2022\nlabor work actions\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, stockholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business or results of operations.\nOther companies may have difficulty acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, due to provisions under our corporate charter and bylaws, as well as Nevada law.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation, our bylaws, and under Nevada law could make it more difficult for other companies to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions, among others, which may inhibit an acquisition of our company by a third party:\n\u2022\nadvance notification procedures for matters to be brought before stockholder meetings\n\u2022\na limitation on who may call stockholder meetings\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without a stockholder vote\nWe are also subject to provisions of Nevada law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns 10 percent or more of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of time after the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors and stockholders.\nUnder U.S. laws and the regulations of the DOT, U.S. citizens must effectively control us. As a result, our president and at least two-thirds of our board of directors must be U.S. citizens and not more than 25 percent of our voting stock may be owned by non-U.S. citizens (although subject to DOT approval, the percent of foreign economic ownership may be as high as 49 percent). Any of these restrictions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nOur corporate charter and bylaws include provisions limiting voting by non-U.S. citizens.\nTo comply with restrictions imposed by federal law on foreign ownership of U.S. airlines, our articles of incorporation and bylaws restrict voting of shares of our capital stock by non-U.S. citizens. The restrictions imposed by federal law currently require no more than 25 percent of our stock be voted, directly or indirectly, by persons who are not U.S. citizens, and that our president and at least two-thirds of the members of our board of directors be U.S. citizens. Our bylaws provide no shares of our capital stock may be voted by or at the direction of non-U.S. citizens unless such shares are registered on a separate stock record, which we refer to as the foreign stock record. Our bylaws further provide no shares of our capital stock will be registered on the foreign stock record if the amount so registered would exceed the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law. Registration on the foreign stock record is made in chronological order based on the date we receive a written request for registration. Non-U.S. citizens will be able to own and vote shares of our common stock only if the combined ownership by all non-U.S. citizens does not violate these requirements.\nThe value of our common stock may be negatively affected by additional issuances of common stock or preferred stock by us as well as general market factors.\nFuture issuances or sales of our common stock or any issuances of convertible preferred stock by us will likely be dilutive to our existing common stockholders. Future issuances or sales of common or preferred stock by us, or the availability of such stock for future issue or sale, could have a negative impact on the price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public or private market, a perception in the market that such sales could occur, or the issuance of securities exercisable or convertible into our common stock, could also adversely affect the prevailing price of our common stock.\nSubstantial sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market, perceives existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. All of our outstanding shares are either freely tradable, without restriction, in the public market or eligible for sale in the public market at various times, subject, in some cases, to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nWe cannot predict whether future sales of our common stock or the availability of our common stock for sale will adversely affect the market price for our common stock or our ability to raise capital by offering equity securities.", "PERMNO": 91659, "SIC": 4512, "TIC": "ALGT"}
