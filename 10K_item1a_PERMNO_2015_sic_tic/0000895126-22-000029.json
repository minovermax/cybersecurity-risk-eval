{"cik": "895126", "company": "CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are numerous factors that affect our business and results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of factors that we consider to be material and that might cause our future results to differ materially from those currently expected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows, reserves and/or our ability to pay our debts and other liabilities could suffer, the trading price and liquidity of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\nSummary Risk Factors\nRisks Related to our Emergence from Bankruptcy\n\u2022We recently emerged from bankruptcy, which may adversely affect our business and relationships.\n\u2022Our actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nRisks Related to Operating our Business\n\u2022Conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for natural gas and oil.\n\u2022Negative public perception regarding us or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\n\u2022The oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive; some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, and there is competition to attract and retain talent, and competition over access to certain industry equipment.\n\u2022Oil, natural gas and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022The ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and related economic turmoil have affected and could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022If commodity prices fall or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record write downs of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.\n\u2022Significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business.\n\u2022If we are not able to replace reserves, we may not be able to sustain production.\n\u2022The actual quantities of and future net revenues from our proved reserves may be less than our estimates.\n\u2022Our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\n\u2022Certain of our undeveloped properties are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage or the leases are renewed.\n\u2022Our commodity price risk management activities may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices, may require us to provide collateral for derivative liabilities and involve risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\u2022Oil and natural gas operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks.\n\u2022Our ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGL economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\n\u2022Risks related to potential acquisitions or dispositions may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, trucking and gathering system capacity constraints and may be subject to interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow.\n\u2022Cyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry and related regulations may adversely impact our operations and, if we or our third-party providers are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, our business may be harmed.\n\u2022Our operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond our control.\nFinancial Risks Related to our Business\n\u2022We have significant capital needs, and our ability to access the capital and credit markets to raise capital on favorable terms is limited by industry conditions.\n\u2022Restrictive covenants in certain of our debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\n\u2022Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nRisks Related to Recent and Pending Acquisitions\n\u2022The Chief Acquisition may not be completed. Failure to complete the Chief Acquisition could negatively impact the price of shares of our common stock, as well as our future business and financial results.\n\u2022The synergies attributable to the Vine Acquisition, or Chief Acquisition, if consummated, may vary from expectations, and we will be subject to business uncertainties for a period of time after the closing of the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated, which could adversely affect the combined company after these acquisitions. These uncertainties could include, but may not be limited to, loss of key personnel, retention of customer or supplier contracts or relationships, and litigation in connection with the Chief Acquisition.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\u2022We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which can change and could adversely impact our business.\n\u2022Environmental and regulatory matters and related costs can be significant.\n\u2022Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business, financial results or stock price.\n\u2022The taxation of independent producers is subject to change, and changes in tax law could increase our cost of doing business.\n\u2022Trading in our new common stock, additional issuances of new common stock, and certain other stock transactions could lead to a second, potentially more restrictive annual limitation on the utilization of our tax attributes reducing their ability to offset future taxable income, which may result in an increase to income tax liabilities.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022A deterioration in general economic, political, business or industry conditions would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\n\u2022Military and other armed conflicts, including terrorist activities, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Emergence from Bankruptcy\nWe recently emerged from bankruptcy, which may adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from bankruptcy may adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, vendors, contractors or employees. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022key vendors or other contract counterparties may terminate their relationships with us or require additional financial assurances or enhanced performance from us;\n\u2022our ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022our ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives may be adversely affected; and\n\u2022competitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results may vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections.\nRisks Related to Operating our Business\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for natural gas and oil.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to natural gas and oil, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for natural gas and oil. The impact of the changing demand for natural gas and oil could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and financial position.\nNegative public perception regarding us or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, seismic activity, climate change, explosions of natural gas transmission lines and the development and operation of pipelines and other midstream facilities may lead to generally increased political pressure and regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. Additionally, environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates may oppose our operations through organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations or those of our midstream transportation providers, encourage capital providers to divest of their interests in us or our industry, intervene in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets or those of our midstream transportation providers, or file lawsuits or other actions\ndesigned to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of our assets and business or those of our midstream transportation providers. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. A change in control of national or local governments, including the U.S. presidential administration, Congress, state or local governments, and governments of other countries may also result in uncertainty regarding the degree to which there will be increased restrictions on oil and gas production activities, which could materially adversely affect our industry and our financial condition and results of operations.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention towards sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in energy-related activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult or costly for us to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Members of the investment community have also begun to screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance, including practices related to GHGs and climate change, before investing in our common units. Any efforts to improve our sustainability practices in response to these pressures may increase our costs, and we may be forced to implement technologies that are less economically efficient or are not economically viable in order to improve our sustainability performance and to meet the specific requirements to perform services for certain customers.\nThe oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive; some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, and there is competition to attract and retain talent and competition over access to certain industry equipment.\nWe face competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, buying and selling reserves and leases, obtaining goods and services needed to operate our business and marketing oil, natural gas or NGL. Competitors include multinational oil companies, independent production companies and individual producers and operators. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to address industry challenges more effectively or weather industry downturns more easily than we can. We also face indirect competition from alternative energy sources, including wind, solar and electric power.\nOur performance depends largely on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals and on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense. If we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining skilled employees and managerial talent, our ability to compete effectively may be diminished. We also compete for the equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties. Typically, during times of rising commodity prices, drilling and operating costs will also increase. During these periods, there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield equipment and services, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget.\nOil, natural gas and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur revenues, results of operations, profitability, liquidity, leverage ratio and ability to grow and invest in capital expenditures depend primarily upon the prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGL we sell. We incur substantial expenditures to replace reserves, sustain production and fund our business plans. Low oil, natural gas and NGL prices can negatively affect the amount of cash available for capital expenditures, debt service and debt repayment and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves. In addition, periods of low oil and natural gas prices may result in a reduction of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties due to recognizing impairments in proved and unproved properties.\nVolatility in oil, natural gas and NGL prices may result from factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022domestic and worldwide supplies of oil, natural gas and NGL, including U.S. inventories of oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022weather conditions;\n\u2022changes in the level of consumer and industrial demand, including impacts from global or national health epidemics and concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022the effectiveness of worldwide conservation measures;\n\u2022the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and processing facilities;\n\u2022the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including by commodity price speculators and others;\n\u2022U.S. exports of oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022the price and level of foreign imports;\n\u2022the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and others to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022increased use of competing energy products, including alternative energy sources;\n\u2022political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022acts of terrorism; and\n\u2022domestic and global economic and political conditions.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil, natural gas and NGL price movements. In addition, any prolonged period of lower prices could reduce the quantities of reserves that we may economically produce.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related economic turmoil have affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption during 2020 and 2021, and threatens to do the same in 2022. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has reached more than 200 countries and continues to present rapidly evolving economic and public health risks. The pandemic has adversely impacted the entire global economy, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding how long the pandemic and related market conditions will persist and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus, such as quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns and restrictions on operations. In certain cases, states that had begun taking steps to reopen their economies experienced a subsequent surge in cases of COVID-19, causing these states to cease or dramatically scale back such reopening measures in some cases and reinstitute restrictions in others. Our precautionary measures and plans may not be effective in preventing future disruptions to our business. Moreover, future operations could be negatively affected if a significant number of our employees are quarantined as a result of exposure to the virus. In addition, actions by our customers and derivative contract counterparties in response to COVID-19 and its economic impacts, including potential non-performance or delays, may also have an adverse impact on our business.\nFurthermore, the impact of the pandemic, including the initial resulting reduction in demand for oil and natural gas, coupled with the sharp decline in commodity prices following the announcement of price reductions and production increases in March 2020 by members of OPEC+ has led to significant global economic contraction generally and in our industry in particular. While an agreement to cut production has since been announced by OPEC+ and its allies, the supply and demand imbalance created by such price reductions and production increases, coupled with the impact of COVID-19, has continued to result in a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry. Although OPEC+ agreed in April 2020 to cut oil production and has extended such production cuts through\nMarch 2021, crude oil prices have remained depressed as a result of the oversupply of oil, an increasingly utilized global storage network and the decrease in crude oil demand due to COVID-19. Oil and natural gas prices are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and as changes in oil and natural gas inventories, industry demand and national and economic performance are reported, and we cannot predict when prices will improve and stabilize. Due to numerous uncertainties, we cannot at this time predict the full impact that COVID-19 or the significant disruption and volatility currently being experienced in the oil and natural gas markets will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ultimate impact of COVID-19 will depend on future developments that cannot be anticipated, including, among others, the ultimate severity of the virus and its rapidly evolving and spreading variants, the consequences of governmental and other measures designed to mitigate the spread of the virus, the development and availability of treatments and vaccines and the extent to which these treatments and vaccines may remain effective as new strains of the virus emerge, the duration of the pandemic, any further actions taken by members of OPEC+, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and other third parties, workforce availability, and the timing and extent of any return to normal economic and operating conditions.\nIf commodity prices fall or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record write downs of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nWe have been required to write down the carrying value of certain of our oil and natural gas properties in the past, and there is a risk that we will be required to take additional writedowns in the future. Writedowns may occur in the future when oil and natural gas prices are low, or if we have downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of operating or development costs, or due to the anticipated sale of properties.\nThe successful efforts method of accounting requires that we periodically review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment. Impairment is recognized for the excess of book value over fair value when the book value of a proven property is greater than the expected undiscounted future net cash flows from that property and on acreage when conditions indicate the carrying value is not recoverable. We may be required to write down the carrying value of a property based on oil and natural gas prices at the time of the impairment review, or as a result of continuing evaluation of drilling results, production data, economics, divestiture activity, and other factors. A writedown constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings and does not impact cash or cash flows from operating activities; however, it reflects our long-term ability to recover an investment, reduces our reported earnings and increases certain leverage ratios. See Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties included in Item 7 of this report for further information.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business.\nOur exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. We intend to fund our capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, and to the extent that is not sufficient, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our ability to generate operating cash flow is subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of oil, natural gas and NGL, our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein. Our forecasted 2022 capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized interest, are $1.5 - $1.8 billion compared to our 2021 capital spending level of $746 million. Management continues to review operational plans for 2022 and beyond, which could result in changes to projected capital expenditures and projected revenues from sales of oil, natural gas and NGL. If we are unable to fund our capital expenditures as planned, we could experience a curtailment of our exploration and development activity, a loss of properties and a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.\nIf we are not able to replace reserves, we may not be able to sustain production.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, exploration or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves.\nThe actual quantities of and future net revenues from our proved reserves may be less than our estimates.\nThe estimates of our proved reserves and the estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves included in this report are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil, natural gas and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is complex and involves significant decisions and assumptions associated with geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each well. Therefore, these estimates are subject to future revisions.\nActual future production, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil, natural gas and NGL reserves most likely will vary from these estimates. Such variations may be significant and could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our proved reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 41% of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflect our plans for capital expenditures to convert PUDs into proved developed reserves, including approximately $2.7 billion during the next five years. You should be aware that the estimated development costs may not equal our actual costs, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop our PUDs, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove them from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC's reserve reporting rules, because PUDs generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any PUDs that are not developed within this five-year time frame.\nYou should not assume that the present values included in this report represent the current market value of our estimated reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimates of our present values are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimates. The price on the date of estimate is calculated as the average oil and natural gas price during the 12 months ending in the current reporting period, determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period. The December 31, 2021 present value is based on a $66.56 per bbl of oil price and a $3.60 per mcf of natural gas price, before considering basis differential adjustments. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of an estimate.\nThe timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. Any changes in demand for oil and natural gas, governmental regulations or taxation will also affect the future net cash flows from our production. In addition, the 10% discount factor that is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor. Interest rates in effect from time to time and the risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the appropriateness of the 10% discount factor.\nOur development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nWe have a substantial inventory of undeveloped properties. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered. We have acquired undeveloped properties that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our initial investments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that undeveloped properties acquired by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive, or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such undeveloped properties or wells.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property. Drilling and completion operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a\nresult of unexpected drilling conditions, title problems, equipment failures or accidents, shortages of midstream transportation, equipment or personnel, environmental issues, state or local bans or moratoriums on hydraulic fracturing and produced water disposal, federal restrictions on oil and gas leasing and permitting, and a decline in commodity prices, among others. The profitability of wells, particularly in certain of the areas in which we operate, will be reduced or eliminated if commodity prices decline. In addition, wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets, which are dependent upon the current and future market prices for oil, natural gas and NGL, costs associated with producing oil, natural gas and NGL and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost.\nWe rely to a significant extent on seismic data and other technologies in evaluating undeveloped properties and in conducting our exploration activities. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively, prior to acquisition of undeveloped properties, or drilling a well, whether oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. If we incur significant expense in acquiring or developing properties that do not produce as expected or at profitable levels, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our undeveloped properties are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage or the leases are renewed.\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. If our leases on our undeveloped properties expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Although we seek to actively manage our undeveloped properties, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Low commodity prices may cause us to delay our drilling plans and, as a result, lose our right to develop the related properties.\nOur commodity price risk management activities may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices, may require us to provide collateral for derivative liabilities and involve risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us.\nTo manage our exposure to price volatility, we enter into oil, natural gas and NGL price derivative contracts. Our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices. The fair value of our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative instruments can fluctuate significantly between periods. Our decision to mitigate cash flow volatility through derivative arrangements, if any, is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions and our desire to stabilize cash flows necessary for the development of our proved reserves. We may choose not to enter into derivatives if we believe the pricing environment for certain time periods is unfavorable. Additionally, we may choose to liquidate existing derivative positions prior to the expiration of their contractual maturities to monetize gain positions for the purpose of funding our capital program.\nMost of our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts are with counterparties under bilateral hedging arrangements. Under a majority of our arrangements, the collateral provided for our obligations is secured by the same hydrocarbon interests that secure our Exit Credit Facility. Our counterparties\u2019 obligations under the arrangements must be secured by cash or letters of credit to the extent that any mark-to-market amounts owed to us exceed defined thresholds. Collateral requirements are dependent to a large extent on oil and natural gas prices.\nOil, natural gas and NGL derivative transactions expose us to the risk that our counterparties, which are generally financial institutions, may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. During periods of declining commodity prices, the value of our commodity derivative asset positions increase, which increases our counterparty exposure. Although the counterparties to our hedging arrangements are required to secure their obligations to us under certain scenarios, if any of our counterparties were to default on their obligations to us under the derivative contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future cash flows being exposed to commodity price changes.\nOil and natural gas operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks.\nOur operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. Drilling for oil, natural gas and NGL can be unprofitable, not only from\ndry holes, but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs. Substantial costs are required to locate, acquire and develop oil and gas properties, and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted. Although both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. In addition, our oil and gas properties can become damaged, our operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022unexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations;\n\u2022equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering or loss of well control;\n\u2022the mishandling or underground migration of fluids and chemicals;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and extreme temperatures;\n\u2022issues with title or in receiving governmental permits or approvals;\n\u2022restricted takeaway capacity for our production, including due to inadequate midstream infrastructure or constrained downstream markets;\n\u2022environmental hazards or liabilities;\n\u2022restrictions in access to, or disposal of, water used or produced in drilling and completion operations;\n\u2022shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment; and\n\u2022unexpected or unforeseen changes in regulatory policy, and political or public opinion.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property, as well as significant liabilities. Although we may maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities, and our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. For certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism and piracy, we have limited or no insurance coverage. Also, in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured may expose us to liabilities.\nMoreover, certain of these events could result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties, including persons living in proximity to our operations, our employees and employees of our contractors, leading to possible injuries, death or significant damage to property and natural resources.\nOur ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGL economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nDevelopment activities, particularly hydraulic fracturing, require the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. Water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas. The imposition of environmental initiatives and regulations could further restrict our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas.\nRisks related to potential acquisitions or dispositions may adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate acquisitions and dispositions of assets, businesses and other investments. These transactions may not result in the anticipated benefits or efficiencies. In addition, acquisitions may be financed by borrowings, requiring us to incur more debt, or by the issuance of our common stock. Any such acquisition or disposition involves risks and we cannot assure you that:\n\u2022any acquisition will be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls;\n\u2022the due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition will uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure, such as title defects and potential environmental and other liabilities;\n\u2022post-closing purchase price adjustments will be realized in our favor;\n\u2022our assumptions about, among other things, reserves, estimated production, revenues, capital expenditures, operating, operating expenses and costs will be accurate;\n\u2022any investment, acquisition, disposition or integration will not divert management resources from the operation of our business; and\n\u2022any investment, acquisition, or disposition or integration will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reserves.\nIf any of these risks materialize, the benefits of such acquisition or disposition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves could be negatively impacted.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, trucking and gathering system capacity constraints and may be subject to interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow.\nIn certain resource plays, the capacity of gathering and transportation systems is insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells. We rely heavily on third parties to meet our oil, natural gas and NGL gathering needs. Capital constraints could limit the construction of new pipelines and gathering systems and the provision or expansion of trucking services by third parties. Until this new capacity is available, we may experience delays in producing and selling our oil, natural gas and NGL. In such event, we might have to shut in our wells while awaiting a pipeline connection or additional capacity, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our oil, natural gas and NGL production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could materially adversely affect our cash flow.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry and related regulations may adversely impact our operations and, if we or our third-party providers are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, our business may be harmed.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our customers, employees and third-party partners. In addition, many third-party providers, such as vendors and others in the supply chain, directly or indirectly provide to us various products and services across an array of internal and external functions that enable us to conduct, monitor and/or protect our business, systems and data assets. In addition, in the ordinary course, we and our service providers collect, process, transmit, and store proprietary and confidential data, including personal information.\nWe have been the subject of cyber-attacks on our internal systems and through those of third parties in the past. As an energy company, we expect to continue to be a target for such attacks in the future. We are vulnerable to malicious attacks by third parties or insiders, social engineering and human error, as well as to bugs and other vulnerabilities that may exist in our third-party providers systems. Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information, customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If\nour information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached (for example, due to ransomware), we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, which may include disruptions to our drilling, completion, production and corporate functions. A cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates or third-party providers, could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production, non-compliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability, and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.\nBoth the frequency and magnitude of cyberattacks is expected to increase and attackers are becoming more sophisticated. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent future attacks, particularly as the methodologies utilized by attackers change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and we may be unable to investigate or remediate incidents because attackers are increasingly using techniques and tools designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. Further, our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to spend significant additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. In addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs as we collect and store personal data related to employees, royalty owners and other parties. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) was signed into law on June 28, 2018 and largely took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and enhanced consumer protections for those individuals, and provides for statutory fines and penalties for certain data security breaches or other CCPA violations. At least fifteen other states have considered, and some have already enacted privacy laws like the CCPA.\nAny losses, costs or liabilities directly or indirectly related to cyberattacks or similar incidents may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, any or all of our insurance policies.\nOur operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond our control.\nOur operations are subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond our control, including risks from extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, and ambient temperature increases, as well as wildfires, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people, our assets or the natural environment.\nIt is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, our headquarters are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, an area that experiences severe weather events, including tornadoes and earthquakes. Our information systems and administrative and management processes are primarily provided to our various drilling projects and producing wells throughout the United States from this location, which could be disrupted if a catastrophic event, such as a tornado, power outage or act of terror, destroyed or severely damaged our headquarters. Any such catastrophic event could harm our ability to conduct normal operations and could adversely affect our business.\nFinancial Risks Related to our Business\nWe have significant capital needs, and our ability to access the capital and credit markets to raise capital on favorable terms is limited by industry conditions.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. In the past, low commodity prices have caused and may continue to cause lenders to increase the interest rates under upstream operators\u2019 credit\nfacilities, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt around maturity on favorable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. Additionally, certain financial institutions have announced their intention to cease investment banking and corporate lending activities in the North American oil and gas sector or have established climate-related funding commitments that could have the effect of limiting their investment in us or our industry. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and our ability to repay or refinance our debt. Additionally, challenges in the economy have led and could further lead to reductions in the demand for oil and gas, or further reductions in the prices of oil and gas, or both, which could have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRestrictive covenants in certain of our debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nOur debt agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022make investments or loans;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes;\n\u2022make restricted payments;\n\u2022make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022use the proceeds of asset sales.\nWe may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under certain of our debt agreements. The restrictions contained in the covenants could:\n\u2022limit our ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions, to meet capital needs or otherwise to restrict our activities or business plan; and\n\u2022adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or divestitures to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under certain of our debt instruments may bear interest at rates based on LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. The publication of USD LIBOR will cease after June 30, 2023, and the FCA confirmed that use of USD LIBOR will not be permitted in most new contracts after December 31, 2021. The Credit Agreement adopts the hardwire approach for LIBOR replacement which provides that Term SOFR (or Daily Simple SOFR, to the extent Term SOFR is unavailable) will be used in the event of LIBOR cessation or upon an election to early opt-in, once SOFR becomes available. The Credit Agreement also provides that in the event that SOFR is not available at the time of LIBOR cessation, the borrower and agent must agree on a successor rate subject to negative consent rights of the lenders. We are currently evaluating the impact of the potential replacement of the LIBOR interest rate. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Recent and Pending Acquisitions\nThe Chief Acquisition may not be completed. Failure to complete the Chief Acquisition could negatively impact the price of shares of our common stock, as well as our future business and financial results.\nThe Chief Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived, prior to the completion of the merger. These conditions to the completion of the Chief Acquisition, some of which are beyond our control, may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Chief Acquisition may be delayed or may not be completed.\nIf the Chief Acquisition is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business, financial condition and financial results may be adversely affected. Without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the transactions, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may be required to pay certain costs relating to the Chief Acquisition, which are substantial, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the transactions are completed;\n\u2022time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the Chief Acquisition could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from financial markets, including negative impacts on the price of our common stock, including to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Chief Acquisition will be completed;\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from employees, customers or vendors; and\n\u2022we may not have been able to take certain actions during the pendency of the Chief Acquisition that would have benefitted us as an independent company and the opportunity to take such actions may no longer be available.\nIn addition, any delay in completing the Chief Acquisition may significantly reduce the synergies and other benefits that we expect that the combined company may achieve if the Chief Acquisition is completed within the expected timeframe.\nRequired regulatory approvals for the Chief Acquisition may not be received, may take longer than expected to be received, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met.\nCompletion of the Chief Acquisition is conditioned upon the expiration or termination of any waiting period applicable to the merger under the HSR Act. Although each party has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and to respond to and comply with any request for information from any governmental entity charged with enforcing, applying, administering or investigating the HSR Act or any other antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that HSR clearance will be obtained and that the other conditions to completing the Chief Acquisition will be satisfied. In addition, the governmental authorities from which the regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the Chief Acquisition or require changes to the terms of the Chief Acquisition. We cannot provide any assurance that these approvals will be obtained or that there will not be any adverse consequences to our business resulting from the failure to obtain these governmental approvals or from conditions that could be imposed in connection with obtaining these governmental approvals.\nCompletion of the Chief Acquisition is also conditioned upon the authorization for listing of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Chief Acquisition on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or such other Nasdaq market on which our shares of common stock are then listed. There can be no assurance that such approval will be obtained or that the other conditions to completing the Chief Acquisition will be satisfied.\nSuch conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding consummation of the Chief Acquisition or of imposing additional costs or limitations on us following completion of the Chief Acquisition, any of which might have an adverse effect on us following completion of the Chief Acquisition and may diminish the anticipated benefits of the Chief Acquisition.\nThe synergies attributable to the Vine Acquisition, or Chief Acquisition, if consummated, may vary from expectations.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the Vine Acquisition, or Chief Acquisition, if consummated, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The success of these acquisitions will depend, in significant part, on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, grow the revenue of the combined company and realize the anticipated strategic benefits and synergies from the combinations, such as operational and financial scale, and increased Free Cash Flow. However, achieving these goals requires, among other things, realization of the targeted cost synergies expected from these acquisitions. The growth and the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Actual operating, technological, strategic and revenue opportunities, if achieved at all, may be less significant than expected or may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If we are not able to achieve these objectives and realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the Vine Acquisition, or Chief Acquisition, if consummated, within the anticipated timing or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties for a period of time after the closing of the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated, which could adversely affect the combined company after these acquisitions.\nUncertainty about the effect of these acquisitions on employees, industry contacts and business partners may have an adverse effect on the combined company. These uncertainties may impair the combined company\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel for a period of time after the closing of these acquisitions and could cause industry contacts, business partners and others that deal with the combined company to seek to change their existing business relationships with the combined company.\nUncertainties associated with the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated, may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.\nThe combined company\u2019s success after the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated, will depend in part upon the ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of the Company, Vine and Chief. Current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the Vine Acquisition, and Chief Acquisition, if consummated, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of the combined company to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will achieve the same success attracting or retaining key management personnel and other key employees as the Company may have independently achieved prior to the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction and acquisition-related costs in connection with the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, which may be in excess of our expectations.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with negotiating and completing the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition and combining the operations of the acquired entities and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition and include, among others, employee retention costs, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, severance and benefit costs and filing fees.\nWe will also incur transaction fees and costs related to the integration of the companies, which may be substantial. Moreover, we may incur additional unanticipated expenses in connection with the Vine Acquisition and the integration, including costs associated with any stockholder litigation related to the Vine Acquisition. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved\nin the near term, or at all. Similar risks regarding the integration of Chief may arise if the Chief Acquisition is completed.\nThe costs described above, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompletion of the Chief Acquisition may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Chief or its subsidiaries is a party.\nThe completion of the Chief Acquisition may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Chief or its subsidiaries is a party. If we are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under such agreements, potentially terminating the agreement or seeking monetary damages. Additionally, even if we are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to the combined company.\nLawsuits may be filed against the Company Chief and their respective affiliates in connection with the Chief Acquisition. An adverse ruling could result in substantial costs and could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the Chief Acquisition.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition, merger or other business combination agreements like those related to the Chief Acquisition. Even if any of the lawsuits which have been filed and may be filed are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition.\nOne of the conditions to the closing of the Chief Acquisition is that no injunction by any governmental entity has been entered and continues to be in effect and no law has been adopted, in either case, that prohibits the closing of the Chief Acquisition. Consequently, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Chief Acquisition, that injunction may delay or prevent the Chief Acquisition from being completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, which may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that any of the defendants in any potential future lawsuits will be successful in the outcome of such lawsuits. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur integration of the acquired businesses into the Company may not be as successful as anticipated, and we may not achieve the intended benefits or do so within the intended timeframes.\nThe Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated, involve numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax and other risks, potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses, and uncertainties related to design, operation and integration of the acquired businesses\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. Difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses into the Company may result in the acquired businesses performing differently than expected, operational challenges, or the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among others:\n\u2022the inability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses into the Company in a manner that permits the Company to achieve the full revenue and cost savings anticipated from the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated;\n\u2022complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex integrated business;\n\u2022not realizing anticipated operating synergies;\n\u2022integrating personnel from different entities and the loss of key employees;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Vine Acquisition or Chief Acquisition, if consummated;\n\u2022integrating relationships with industry contacts and business partners;\n\u2022performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the acquisitions and the integration process; and\n\u2022the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nAdditionally, the success of the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated, will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the acquired businesses, including operational and other synergies that we believe the combined company will achieve. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated, may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee.\nOur results may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated.\nThe success of the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated, will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the acquired businesses, including the need to integrate the operations and businesses of the acquired entities into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers, vendors, industry contacts and business partners.\nThe anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated, may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that we have made, such as the achievement of operating synergies, may not be realized. There could also be unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisitions that were not discovered in the due diligence review conducted prior to entering into each transaction.\nThe market price of our common stock may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected the price of our common stock.\nOur business differs from that of Vine in certain respects, and if consummated, the business acquired in the Chief Acquisition will also differ. Accordingly, the financial position or results of operations and/or cash flows of the combined company, as well as the market price of our common stock, may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our financial position or results of operations and/or cash flows as an independent standalone company.\nAs a result of the Vine Acquisition, we have incorporated Vine\u2019s hedging activities into our business, and we may be exposed to additional commodity price risks arising from such hedges.\nTo mitigate its exposure to changes in commodity prices, Vine hedges natural gas prices from time to time, primarily through the use of certain derivative instruments. As a result of the Vine Acquisition, we assumed Vine\u2019s existing derivative instruments. Actual natural gas prices may differ from our expectations and, as a result, such derivative instruments may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe combined company may not be able to retain customers or suppliers, and customers or suppliers may seek to modify contractual obligations with the combined company, either of which could have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business and operations. Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships as a result of the Vine Acquisition or Chief Acquisition, if consummated.\nAs a result of the Vine Acquisition, or Chief Acquisition, if consummated, the combined company may experience impacts on relationships with customers and suppliers that may harm the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations. Certain customers or suppliers may seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations following the Vine Acquisition, or Chief Acquisition, if consummated, whether or not contractual rights are triggered as a result of such acquisition. There can be no guarantee that customers and suppliers will remain with or continue to have a relationship with the combined company or do so on the same or similar contractual terms following the acquisitions. If any customers or suppliers seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations or discontinue their relationships with the combined company, then the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations may be harmed. If the combined company\u2019s suppliers were to seek to terminate or modify an arrangement with the combined company, then the combined company may be unable to procure necessary supplies or services from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe acquired entities also have contracts with vendors, landlords, licensors and other business partners that may require consents from these other parties in connection with the Vine Acquisition or Chief Acquisition, if consummated. If these consents cannot be obtained, the combined company may suffer a loss of potential future revenue, incur costs and/or lose rights that may be material to the business of the combined company. Any such disruptions could limit the combined company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Vine Acquisition or Chief Acquisition, if consummated.\nWe are subject to risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and it is difficult to predict what effect, if any, this might have on the combined company after the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated.\nWe face various risks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The actual and potential effects of COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, its impact on general economic conditions, trade and financing markets, changes in customer behavior and continuity in business operations, all of which create significant uncertainty. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in governmental authorities implementing significant and varied measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place and stay at home orders and business shutdowns. Governmental authorities may enact additional restrictions, or tighten existing measures if COVID-19 continues to spread. These measures, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic broadly, may have a negative effect on the combined company after the Vine Acquisition and Chief Acquisition, if consummated, which effect will be difficult to predict.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which can change and could adversely impact our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and other laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to environmental matters, worker health and safety, wildlife conservation, the gathering and transportation of oil, gas and NGL, conservation policies, reporting obligations, royalty payments, unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes, and tribal laws for a minor portion of our acreage. Such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling, completion and well operations. If permits are not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. For example, on January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order effectively suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days. Then, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order indefinitely suspending new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. On November 26, 2021, the U.S. Department of the Interior released its \u201cReport On The Federal Oil And Gas Leasing Program,\u201d which assessed the current state of oil and gas leasing on federal lands and proposed several reforms, including raising royalty rates and implementing stricter standards for entities seeking to purchase oil and gas leases. With respect to offshore oil and gas leases, challenges to President Biden\u2019s moratorium on leasing initially prevailed on June 15, 2021, when a federal court judge in Louisiana issued a nationwide preliminary injunction effectively preventing the Biden Administration from implementing the pause of\nnew oil and natural gas leases on federal lands and waters and forcing the lease sale; however, on January 25, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated the lease sale, reasoning that the Biden Administration did not properly evaluate the climate change impacts of drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Although we do not expect this ruling to impact the availability of onshore federal oil and gas lease sales, the Biden Administration\u2019s and certain federal courts\u2019 focus on the climate change impacts of federal projects could result in similar restrictions surrounding onshore drilling, onshore federal lease availability, and restrictions on the ability to obtain required permits, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations. In addition, we may be required to make large, sometimes unexpected, expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations, permits or orders.\nIn addition, changes in public policy have affected, and in the future could further affect, our operations. Regulatory developments could, among other things, restrict production levels, impose price controls, change environmental protection requirements with respect to the treatment of hazardous waste, air emissions, or water discharges, and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to the government. Our operating and compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised, reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. We do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations, size and financial strength. Although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could significantly impact our profitability, financial condition and liquidity. This is particularly true of changes related to pipeline safety, hydraulic fracturing and climate change, as discussed below.\nPipeline Safety. The pipeline assets in which we own interests are subject to stringent and complex regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity management. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for gas, NGL and condensate transmission pipelines as well as for certain low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting hazardous liquids, such as oil, that, in the event of a failure, could affect \u201chigh consequence areas.\u201d Recent PHMSA rules have also extended certain requirements for integrity assessments and leak detections beyond high consequence areas and impose a number of reporting and inspection requirements on regulated pipelines. Further, legislation funding PHMSA through 2023 requires the agency to engage in additional rulemaking to amend the integrity management program, emergency response plan, operation and maintenance manual, and pressure control recordkeeping requirements for gas distribution operators; to create new leak detection and repair program obligations; and to set new minimum federal safety standards for onshore gas gathering lines. At this time, we cannot predict the cost of these requirements or other potential new or amended regulations, but they could be significant. Moreover, violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties.\nHydraulic Fracturing. Several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. We cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations, our business and operations could be subject to delays, increased operating and compliance costs and potential bans. Additional regulation could also lead to greater opposition to hydraulic fracturing, including litigation.\nClimate Change. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Policy makers at both the U.S. federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories, limitations and/or taxes on greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA and the BLM have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions, which also include leak detection and repair requirements, for the oil and gas industry and are likely to create additional regulations regarding such matters. For example, on November 15, 2021, the EPA proposed new regulations to establish comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from new and existing operations in the oil and gas sector, including the exploration and production, transmission, processing, and storage segments. The comment period for the proposed rule ended on January 31, 2022, and the EPA hopes to finalize it by the end of 2022. Once finalized, the regulations are likely to be subject to legal challenge, and will also need to be incorporated into the states\u2019 implementation plans, which will need to be approved by the EPA in individual rulemakings that could also be subject to legal challenge. As a result, we cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to\ncomply with such requirements. However, given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a significant possibility. In addition, several states in which we operate have imposed limitations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities. Legislative and state initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of renewable energy standards and/or cap-and-trade and/or carbon tax programs. Renewable energy standards (also referred to as renewable portfolio standards) require electric utilities to provide a specified minimum percentage of electricity from eligible renewable resources, with potential increases to the required percentage over time. The development of a federal renewable energy standard, or the development of additional or more stringent renewable energy standards at the state level could reduce the demand for oil and gas, thereby adversely impacting our earnings, cash flows and financial position. A cap-and-trade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances. A federal cap and trade program or expanded use of cap and trade programs at the state level could impose direct costs on us through the purchase of allowances and could impose indirect costs by incentivizing consumers to shift away from fossil fuels. In addition, federal or state carbon taxes could directly increase our costs of operation and similarly incentivize consumers to shift away from fossil fuels.\nIn addition, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in an increasing number of financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this would make it more difficult and expensive to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Members of the investment community have also begun to screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance, including practices related to greenhouse gases and climate change, before investing in our common stock. Any efforts to improve our sustainability practices in response to these pressures may increase our costs, and we may be forced to implement technologies that are not economically viable in order to improve our sustainability performance and to meet the specific requirements to perform services for certain customers.\nThese various legislative, regulatory and other activities addressing greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our business, including by imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations, which could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. Limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and gas, which could lower the value of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.\nEnvironmental matters and related costs can be significant.\nAs an owner, lessee or operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations. Environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties, as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas. Any future costs associated with these matters are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. Changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social and governance matters (\u201cESG\u201d) may impact our business, financial results or stock price.\nIn recent years, increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to ESG matters in public discourse and the investment community. A number of advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters, including through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, public pension funds, activist investors, universities and other members of the investing community. These activities include increasing attention and demands for action related to climate change, advocating for changes to companies\u2019 boards of directors, and promoting the use of energy saving building materials. These activities may result in demand shifts for oil, natural gas and NGL. In addition, a failure to comply with investor or customer expectations and standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues,\nregardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, could cause reputational harm to our business, increase our risk of litigation, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. These ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital.\nThe taxation of independent producers is subject to change, and changes in tax law could increase our cost of doing business.\nWe are subject to taxation by various governmental authorities at the federal, state and local levels in the jurisdictions in which we do business. New legislation could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities making it more costly for us to produce oil and natural gas by increasing our tax burden. The Biden administration has called for changes to fiscal and tax policies which could lead to comprehensive tax reform. For example, federal legislation has been proposed that, if enacted, would impact federal income tax law applicable to the deduction of intangible drilling and development costs, percentage depletion and, the expensing of geological, geophysical, exploration and development costs. Other proposals changing federal income tax law could include a new corporate minimum tax based on book income, an increase to the corporate tax rate and the elimination of certain tax credits. If enacted, certain of these proposals could have a correlative impact on state income taxes. In addition, state and local authorities could enact new legislation that would increase various taxes such as sales, severance and ad valorem taxes as well as accelerate the collection of such taxes.\nTrading in our new common stock, additional issuances of new common stock, and certain other stock transactions could lead to a second, potentially more restrictive annual limitation on the utilization of our tax attributes reducing their ability to offset future taxable income, which may result in an increase to income tax liabilities.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy on February 9, 2021, the Company experienced an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), as all of the common stock and preferred stock of the Predecessor, or the old loss corporation, was canceled and replaced with new common stock of the Successor, or the new loss corporation (the \u201cFirst Ownership Change\u201d). As such, an annual limitation was computed based on the fair market value of the new equity immediately after emergence multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect for the month of February 2021. This annual limitation will restrict the future utilization of our net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforwards and tax credits that existed at the time of emergence.\nTrading in our stock, additional issuances, and other stock transactions occurring subsequent to the emergence from Bankruptcy could lead to a second ownership change. In the event of a second ownership change, a second annual limitation would be determined at such time which could be more restrictive than the limitation of the First Ownership Change. Depending on the market conditions and the Company\u2019s tax basis, a second ownership change may result in a net unrealized built-in loss. The annual limitation in such a case would additionally be applied to certain of the Company\u2019s tax items other than just NOL carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforwards and tax credits. For example, a portion of tax depreciation, depletion and amortization would also be subject to the annual limitation for a five-year period following the ownership change but only to the extent of the net unrealized built-in loss existing at the time of the second ownership change. Whether the new annual limitation would be more restrictive would depend on the value of our stock and the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect at the time of a second ownership change. If the new annual limitation is more restrictive it would apply to certain of the tax attributes existing at the time of the second ownership change including those remaining from the time of the First Ownership Change.\nFurther, should the Company be in a net unrealized built-in gain position at the time of a second ownership change, the proposed regulations issued on September 10, 2019, and on January 14, 2020, under Section 382(h) of the Code (the \u201cProposed Regulations\u201d) would, if finalized in their present form, change the currently existing rules and limit the potential increases to the annual limitation amount for certain built-in gains existing at the time of an ownership change, (unless the transition relief provisions of the Proposed Regulations are applicable), thereby possibly reducing the ability to utilize tax attributes significantly.\nSome states impose similar limitations on tax attribute utilization upon experiencing an ownership change.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nA deterioration in general economic, political, business or industry conditions would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nHistorically, concerns about global economic growth and international political stability have had a significant impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic or political climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our production, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and materially adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nMilitary and other armed conflicts, including terrorist activities, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMilitary and other armed conflicts, terrorist attacks and the threat of both, whether domestic or foreign, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. Continued instability in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in commodity prices, or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 78877, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CHKAQ"}
