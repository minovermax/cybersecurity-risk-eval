Our business is subject to numerous risks. We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases or communications with investors and others. Any or all of our statements in this annual report and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. The factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, actual future results may vary materially from those anticipated in this annual report or our other public statements. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this annual report, including our financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d before deciding whether to invest in our securities. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects. In such an event, the market price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may have similar adverse effects on us.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history, are not currently profitable and may never become profitable.\nWe have incurred losses in every reporting period since we commenced business operations in 2010 and expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 was $1,696,282 and $2,196,834 respectively. As of December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $9,760,954. There is no assurance that any revenues we generate will be sufficient for us to become profitable or to maintain profitability. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 were $1,234,810 and $966,422, respectively, and our operating expenses for those periods were $2,717,650 and $3,251,486 respectively. Our current revenues are not sufficient to fund our operations. We cannot predict when, if ever, we might achieve profitability and we are not certain that we will be able to sustain profitability, if achieved. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability, the market price of our securities is likely to be adversely affected.\nWe may require additional financing to continue our operations, and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash in the amount of $398,391. In February 2017 we closed an underwritten public offering of 1,410,000 units consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant for gross proceeds of $5,823,300. We believe that the net proceeds of approximately $5.25 million from the offering, together with our existing cash and anticipated revenues, will be sufficient to fund our operations until at least January 2019, although there is no assurance that we will not require additional financing before that time. There is no assurance that any future financing that we require to fund our operations will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Such financing, if in the form of equity, may be highly dilutive to our existing stockholders and may otherwise include onerous terms. Such financing, if in the form of debt, may include debt covenants and repayment obligations that are onerous and that adversely affect our business operations. If adequate funds are not available to us, we may be required to delay, limit or terminate our business operations.\nOur limited operating history makes evaluation of our business difficult.\nWe commenced business operations in 2010 and are continuing to develop our technologies and to implement our business plan. Our ability to implement a successful business plan remains unproven, and there is no assurance that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business. Our relatively short operating history, together with the other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, may make it difficult for you to evaluate our business in connection with making a decision about whether to invest in our securities.\nWe face the risks normally associated with a new business.\nWe face all of the risks inherent in a new business, including the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with conducting new operations and efforts to develop and commercialize technologies. These uncertainties include developing our technologies and our brand name, raising capital to meet our working capital requirements and developing a customer base, among others. If we are not effective in addressing these risks, we will not be able to operate profitably in the future, and we may not have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due.\nOur business may be adversely affected by a global economic downturn.\nAny economic downturn generally could cause a drop in government spending and business investment, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, as a result of the current global economic situation, there may be a disruption or delay in performance by our third-party contractors and suppliers. If such third parties are unable to adequately satisfy their contractual commitments to us in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe could incur significant damages if we are unable to adequately discharge our contractual obligations.\nOur failure to comply with contract requirements or to meet our clients\u2019 performance expectations on a contract could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation. This, in turn, would impact our ability to compete for new clients and contracts. Our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages under the terms of such contracts. In addition, some of our contracts require us to indemnify clients for our failure to meet performance standards and/or contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures. Although we do have liability insurance, the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all such potential liabilities.\nWe have financial exposure on our fixed-price contracts because we are required to complete a project even if the costs exceed the revenues we generate on a fixed-price contract.\nWe presently provide and expect to provide services under fixed-price and performance-based arrangements. Generally, under our fixed-price contracts, we receive a specified fee regardless of our cost to perform under such contracts (compared with performance-based contracts under which we earn fees on a per-transaction basis). If we underestimate the cost to complete a contract, we will still be required to complete the work specified under such contract, which could result in a loss to us. To earn a profit on these fixed-price contracts, we must accurately estimate costs involved and assess the probability of meeting the specified objectives, realizing the expected units of work or completing individual transactions, within the contracted time period. We expect to recognize revenues on these contracts, including a portion of estimated profit, as costs are incurred.\nRequests for Proposals (\u201cRFPs\u201d) to secure government contracts are time consuming to prepare and our ability to successfully respond to RFPs will impact our operations.\nTo market our services to government clients, we will likely be required to respond to Requests for Proposals (\u201cRFPs\u201d). To do so effectively, we must estimate accurately our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations and likely terms of the proposals submitted by competitors. We must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within an RFP\u2019s rigid timetable. Our ability to respond successfully to RFPs will greatly impact our business. There is no assurance that we will be awarded any contracts through the RFP process, or that our submitted RFPs will result in profitable contracts.\nSome of our clients may terminate our contracts prior to completion, which could result in revenue shortfalls and reduce profitability or cause losses on contracts.\nMany of our contracts with clients contain initial or base periods of one or more years, as well as option periods typically covering more than one-half of the contract\u2019s initial duration. However, such clients are under no obligation to exercise the option to extend the contract term. The profitability of some of our contracts could be adversely impacted if such options are not exercised and the contract term is not extended accordingly. Additionally, our contracts contain provisions permitting a client to terminate the contract on short notice, with or without cause. The unexpected termination of significant contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls. If revenue shortfalls occur and are not offset by corresponding reductions in expenses, our business could be adversely affected. We cannot anticipate if, when or to what extent a client might terminate its contracts with us.\nWe are subject to government audits, and our failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards could subject us to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions.\nThe government agencies we contract with have the authority to audit and investigate our contracts with them. As part of that process, a government agency may review our performance on a contract, our pricing practices, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If the agency determines that we have improperly allocated costs to a specific contract, we will not be reimbursed for those costs and we will be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been previously reimbursed. If a government audit identifies improper activities by us or we otherwise determine that these activities have occurred, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government. Any adverse determination could adversely impact our ability to bid for RFPs in one or more jurisdictions.\nUnions may interfere with our ability to obtain contracts.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to win profitable contracts to administer and manage programs that may have been previously administered by government employees. Many government employees, however, belong to labor unions with considerable financial resources and lobbying networks. Unions have in the past and are likely to continue to apply political pressure on legislators and other officials seeking to outsource government programs. Union opposition may result in fewer opportunities for us to service government agencies.\nWe rely on our relationship with government agencies to obtain contracts, and there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory relationship with these agencies.\nTo facilitate our ability to prepare bids in response to RFPs, we expect to rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships will enable us to provide informal input and advice to the government entities and agencies prior to the development of an RFP. We also expect to engage marketing consultants, including lobbyists, to establish and maintain relationships with elected officials and appointed members of government agencies. The effectiveness of these consultants may be reduced or eliminated if a significant political change occurs. We may be unable to successfully manage our relationships with government entities and agencies and with elected officials and appointees and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for RFPs.\nWe face significant competition in bidding for government contracts from large national and international organizations.\nThe government contracting industry is subject to intense competition. Many of our competitors are national and international in scope and have greater resources than we do. Substantial resources could enable certain competitors to \u201clow bid\u201d on government RFPs or to take other measures in an effort to gain market share. In addition, we may be unable to compete for a certain large government contract because we may not be able to meet an RFP\u2019s requirement to obtain and post a large cash performance bond. Also, in some geographic areas, we face competition from smaller consulting firms with established reputations and political relationships. There is no assurance that we will compete successfully against our existing competitors or any new competitors.\nWe may not be able to effectively control and manage our growth, which would negatively impact our operations.\nWe have operated our current line of business for approximately six years, and we expect to grow in the near future as our business develops and becomes established. If our business grows as we anticipate, it will be necessary for us to manage our expansion in an orderly fashion. Any significant growth in our activities or in the market for our services will require extension of our managerial, operational, marketing and other resources. Future growth will also impose significant additional responsibilities upon the members of management to identify, recruit, maintain, integrate, and motivate new employees. Our failure to manage growth effectively may lead to operational inefficiencies that will have a negative effect on our profitability. Additionally, if our growth comes at the expense of providing quality service and generating reasonable profits, our ability to successfully bid for contracts and our profitability will be adversely affected. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to effectively manage any future growth we may experience.\nFailure to obtain adequate insurance coverage could put us at risk for uninsured losses.\nWe currently have liability insurance. Some or all of our customers may require insurance as a requirement to conduct business with us. We may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, and there is a risk that our insurance will not provide adequate coverage against our potential losses. Additionally, there are certain types of losses that may not be insurable at a cost that we can afford, and insurance may not be available at any cost with respect to certain losses. Claims or losses in excess of any insurance coverage we may obtain, or the lack of insurance coverage, could put us at risk of loss for any uninsured loss, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our President and Chief Executive Officer, and other key personnel, and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business.\nWe depend on Mark J. Cola, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as key scientific and other personnel. The loss of any of these individuals could harm our business and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. In addition, our delivery of services will be labor-intensive: when we are awarded a contract, we may need to quickly hire project leaders and project management personnel. The additional staff may also create a concurrent demand for increased administrative personnel. The success of our business will require that we attract, develop, motivate and retain:\n\u00b7\nexperienced and innovative executive officers;\n\u00b7\nsenior managers who have successfully managed or designed programs in the public sector; and\n\u00b7\ninformation technology professionals who have designed or implemented complex information technology projects.\nInnovative, experienced and technically proficient individuals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain desirable executive officers, senior managers, and technology professionals. Our inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of executive officers and senior managers could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be dependent on cash flow and payments from customers in order to meet our expense obligations.\nA number of factors may cause our revenues, cash flow and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe progression of contracts;\n\u00b7\nthe levels of revenues earned on fixed-price and performance-based contracts (including any adjustments in expectations for revenue recognition on fixed-price contracts);\n\u00b7\nthe commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n\u00b7\nthe schedules of government agencies and large multinational corporations for awarding contracts;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of our customers to fulfill their obligations under contracts with us; and\n\u00b7\nthe term of awarded contracts and potential acquisitions.\nChanges in the volume of activity and the number of contracts commenced, completed or terminated during any quarter may cause significant variations in our cash flow from operations because a significant portion of our expenses are fixed. Fixed expenses include, rent, payroll, insurance, employee benefits, taxes and other administrative costs and overhead. Moreover, we expect to incur significant operating expenses during the start-up and early stages of large contracts and typically do not receive corresponding payments in that same quarter.\nWe may make acquisitions in the future that we are unable to effectively manage given our limited resources.\nWe may choose to grow our business by acquiring other entities. We may be unable to manage businesses that we have acquired or to integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses, delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations. Moreover, business combinations involve additional risks, including:\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u00b7\nloss of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nour becoming significantly leveraged as a result of the incurrence of debt to finance an acquisition;\n\u00b7\nassumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated operating, accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities;\n\u00b7\namortization of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill; and\n\u00b7\ndilution to existing stockholders and our earnings per share.\nAlso, client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired firm could materially and adversely affect our reputation as a whole. Further, the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings that we anticipated.\nWe may be unable to develop or commercialize new and rapidly evolving technologies.\nMany of our activities involve developing products or processes that are based upon new, rapidly evolving technologies. The ability to commercialize or further develop these technologies could fail for a variety of reasons, both within and outside of our control.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur success in part depends on the ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. To do so, we will be required to prosecute patent applications and maintain patents, obtain new patents and pursue trade secret and other intellectual property protection. We were awarded two U.S. patents with respect to our munitions technology. We were also awarded a U.S. patent with respect to our IPQA\u00ae technology. In addition, we filed ten foreign and U.S. patent applications pertaining to our IPQA\u00ae technology and rapid qualification of additive manufacturing for metal parts. Also, we filed a PCT patent application pertaining to the advanced dental implant technology. However, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. There can be no assurance that our program for protection of intellectual property and proprietary technology will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology from competitors. Our business is also subject to the risk that our issued patents will not provide us with significant competitive advantages if, for example, a competitor were to independently develop or obtain similar or superior technologies. In addition, our issued patents may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties. The enforcement of intellectual property rights is subject to considerable uncertainty, and can be expensive and time-consuming. Patent reform laws and court decisions interpreting such laws, may create additional uncertainty around our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. Proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how are also very important to our business, however, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary information.\nWe may be sued by third parties who claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.\nWe may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our research, development and commercialization activities infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties to which we do not hold licenses or other rights, or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others. Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial and human resources. In addition, if successful, such claims could cause us to pay substantial damages. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nOur services are subject to government regulation, changes in which may have an adverse effect on us.\nOur business activities subject us to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations. For example, we will required to comply with applicable provisions of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d), as well as other export controls and laws governing the manufacture and distribution of munitions technology. Despite the fact that we have applied for and received ITAR compliance, changes in the laws and regulations applicable to our business activities may have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability by making it more expensive and less profitable for us to do business. Additionally, the market for our services depends largely on federal and state legislative programs. These programs can be modified or amended at any time by acts of federal and state governments. Further, if additional programs are not proposed or enacted, or if previously enacted programs are challenged, repealed or invalidated, our growth strategy could be adversely impacted.\nOur bylaws contain provisions indemnifying our officers and directors against all costs, charges, and expenses incurred by them.\nOur Bylaws contain provisions with respect to the indemnification of our officers and directors against all costs, charges and expenses, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment, actually and reasonably incurred by an officer or director, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment in a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding to which he is made a party by reason of being or having been one of our directors or officers. To the extent that our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policy does not provide reimbursement for such costs, charges, expenses and other amounts, we may incur substantial expenses in satisfying our indemnification obligations.\nOur operating costs could be significantly higher than we expect, and this could reduce our future profitability.\nIn addition to general economic conditions, market fluctuations and international risks, significant increases in operating, development and implementation costs could adversely affect us due to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nBusinesses have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption or result in denial of service on websites. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, and communicate with our employees and business partners. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. Although to date we have not experienced any losses relating to cyber-attacks, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe price of our securities could be subject to volatility related or unrelated to our operations, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our securities in this offering.\nBetween January 1, 2015 and March 31, 2017, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $0.70 to a high of $12.40, and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. The trading price of the warrants that we issued in our recent public offering could be subject to similar fluctuations as a result of such factors. These factors include those discussed previously in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and others, such as:\n\u00b7\ndelays or failures in the commercialization of our current or future products and services;\n\u00b7\nquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or adverse publicity about us or our products or services;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products and services, significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nadverse developments with respect to our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\ncommencement of litigation involving us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nany major changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in our industry; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions in the United States and abroad.\nIn addition, the stock market, in general, may experience broad market fluctuations, which may adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our securities.\nWe could be subject to securities class action litigation.\nAny sudden decline in the market price of our securities could trigger securities class action lawsuits against us. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the time and attention of our management would be diverted from our business and operations. We also could be subject to damages claims if we are found to be at fault in connection with a decline in our market price of our securities.\nAn active trading market in our securities may not develop, and you may therefore have difficulty selling your securities at a price that you determine is satisfactory.\nAlthough our common stock and the 2017 warrants are listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock and warrants trade infrequently and in low volumes. The initial offering price of our securities was determined through our negotiations with the underwriters and may not be indicative of the prices that will prevail after this offering.\nThere is no assurance that such securities will trade in the public market at or above the public offering price. Furthermore, there is no assurance that an active trading market for any of our securities will develop or be sustained. If an active market for our securities does not develop or is not maintained, it may be difficult for you to sell your securities when you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider satisfactory. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling securities and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our securities as consideration.\nThere is no assurance that we will satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nEven though our common stock and 2017 warrants are listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market. For example, there is no assurance that our common stock will continue to have a bid price of at least $1.00 per share, which is the minimum bid price under such continued listing requirements, or that we will be able to satisfy other quantitative continued listing requirements. If our securities are de-listed from The NASDAQ Capital Market, our stockholders could incur material adverse consequences such as reduced liquidity for their securities and reduced market prices for their securities. Following such de-listing, we could encounter increased difficulty in issuing additional securities at an attractive price, or at all, in order to fund our operations.\nYou may experience additional dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per unit in this offering. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be lower than the price per unit paid by investors in this offering.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds of our recent public offering and may not use them effectively.\nWe intend to use our cash for the development of our products and service and to repay our outstanding promissory notes (if and to the extent the holders thereof demand repayment). We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from our February 2017 offering to acquire other products or businesses, although we are not currently a party to an agreement regarding any such acquisition. However, our management has broad discretion in the use of cash and will have the right to use our cash in ways that differ substantially from our current plans. Management may spend our cash in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our securities. The failure by management to apply funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business and cause the market price of our securities to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the market price of our securities.\nWe currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth and not to pay any cash dividends on our common stock. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market price of our securities. There is no assurance that our securities will appreciate in price.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, or if they issue adverse or misleading opinions regarding us or our securities, the market price of our securities and their trading volume could decline.\nIf we do not obtain and maintain research coverage by securities and industry analysts, the market price for our securities may be adversely affected. The market price of our securities also may decline if any analyst who covers us issues an adverse or erroneous opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our performance. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the market price of our securities and their trading volume to decline and possibly adversely affect our ability to engage in future financings.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our common stock and will be able to significantly affect matters subject to stockholder approval.\nBased on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2016, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates will beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 13.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of their stock ownership, these stockholders will have the ability to influence our management and policies, and are able to significantly affect the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval such as elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents or approvals of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016, we have 3,133,789 outstanding shares of common stock. Sales of a large number of the shares described in the preceding sentence, or the perception that a large number of shares may be sold, could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe will incur significant costs to ensure compliance with U.S. and NASDAQ reporting and corporate governance requirements.\nWe will incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with applicable U.S. and NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the market price of our securities may be adversely affected.\nAs a public reporting company, we are required to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish such internal control, or any failure of such internal control once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could also prevent us from maintaining accurate accounting records and discovering accounting errors and financial frauds.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We may encounter problems or delays in completing activities necessary to make an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot assess our internal control over financial reporting as effective, investor confidence and share value may be negatively impacted.
