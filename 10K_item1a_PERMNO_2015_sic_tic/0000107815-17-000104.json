{"cik": "783325", "company": "WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control, that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information included in this report and other documents filed by us with the SEC from time to time, when making an investment decision.\nRisks Related to Legislation and Regulation\nOur business is significantly impacted by governmental regulation.\nWe are subject to significant state, local, and federal governmental regulation, including regulation by the various utility commissions in the states where we serve customers. This regulation significantly influences our operating environment and may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers. Many aspects of our operations are regulated, including, but not limited to: the rates we charge our retail electric, natural gas, and steam customers; wholesale power service practices; electric reliability requirements and accounting; participation in the interstate natural gas pipeline capacity market; standards of service; issuance of securities; short-term debt obligations; construction and operation of facilities; transactions with affiliates; and billing practices. Our significant level of regulation imposes restrictions on our operations and causes us to incur substantial compliance costs. Failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations may lead to customer refunds, penalties, and other payments, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe rates, including adjustments determined under riders, we are allowed to charge our customers for retail and wholesale services have the most significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Rate regulation is based on providing an opportunity to recover prudently incurred costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, our ability to obtain rate adjustments in the future is dependent on regulatory action, and there is no assurance that our regulators will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred. In addition, our rate proceedings may not always result in rates that fully recover our costs or provide for a reasonable ROE. We defer certain costs and revenues as regulatory assets and liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured, and is subject to review and approval by our regulators. If recovery of regulatory assets is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these costs would be recognized in current period expense and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWe believe we have obtained the necessary permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, and licenses for our existing operations, have complied with all of their associated terms, and that our businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws. These permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, and licenses may be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, discharge permits and other approvals and licenses are often granted for a term that is less than the expected life of the associated facility. Licenses and permits may require periodic renewal, which may result in additional requirements being imposed by the granting agency. In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted by federal, state, and local agencies, or these agencies may adopt new laws and regulations that apply to us. We cannot predict the impact on our business and operating results of any such actions by these agencies. Changes in regulations, interpretations of regulations, or the imposition of new regulations could influence our operating environment, may result in substantial compliance costs, or may require us to change our business operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain, renew, or comply with these governmental permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, or licenses, or if we are unable to recover any increased costs of complying with additional requirements or any other associated costs in customer rates in a timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may face significant costs to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal and state environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions (including CO2, methane, mercury, SO2, and NOx), water quality, wastewater discharges, and management of hazardous, toxic, and solid wastes and substances. We incur significant costs to comply with these environmental requirements, including costs associated with the installation of pollution control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at our facilities. In addition, if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines.\nThe EPA adopted and implemented (or is in the process of implementing) regulations governing the emission of NOx, SO2, fine particulate matter, mercury, and other air pollutants under the CAA through the NAAQS, the MATS rule, the Clean Power Plan, the\n2016 Form 10-K\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nCSAPR, and other air quality regulations. In addition, the EPA finalized regulations under the Clean Water Act that govern cooling water intake structures at our power plants and revised the effluent guidelines for steam electric generating plants. The EPA has also adopted a final rule that would expand traditional federal jurisdiction over navigable waters and related wetlands for permitting and other regulatory matters; however, this rule has been stayed. We continue to assess the potential cost of complying, and to explore different alternatives in order to comply, with these and other environmental regulations. In addition, as a result of the new Federal Executive Administration taking office in January 2017 and other factors, there is uncertainty as to what capital expenditures or additional costs may ultimately be required to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.\nExisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws or regulations may be adopted at the federal or state level that could result in significant additional expenditures for our generation units or distribution systems, including, without limitation, costs to further limit GHG emissions from our operations; operating restrictions on our facilities; and increased compliance costs. In addition, the operation of emission control equipment and compliance with rules regulating our intake and discharge of water could increase our operating costs and reduce the generating capacity of our power plants. Any such regulation may also create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances and could affect the availability and/or cost of fossil fuels.\nAs a result, certain of our coal-fired electric generating facilities may become uneconomical to maintain and operate, which could result in some of these units being retired early or converted to an alternative type of fuel. For example, we expect to retire the remaining Pulliam coal-fired units in the next several years. If generation facility owners in the Midwest, including us, retire a significant number of older coal-fired generation facilities, a potential reduction in the region's capacity reserve margin below acceptable risk levels may result. This could impair the reliability of the grid in the Midwest, particularly during peak demand periods. A reduction in available future capacity could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers' needs.\nOur electric and natural gas utilities are also subject to significant liabilities related to the investigation and remediation of environmental impacts at certain of our current and former facilities and at third-party owned sites. We accrue liabilities and defer costs (recorded as regulatory assets) incurred in connection with our former manufactured gas plant sites. These costs include all costs incurred to date that we expect to recover, management's best estimates of future costs for investigation and remediation, and related legal expenses, and are net of amounts recovered by or that may be recovered from insurance or other third parties. Due to the potential for imposition of stricter standards and greater regulation in the future, as well as the possibility that other potentially responsible parties may not be financially able to contribute to cleanup costs, conditions may change or additional contamination may be discovered, our remediation costs could increase, and the timing of our capital and/or operating expenditures in the future may accelerate or could vary from the amounts currently accrued.\nIn the event we are not able to recover all of our environmental expenditures and related costs from our customers in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Further, increased costs recovered through rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nLitigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury, property damage, and other claims for damages alleged to have been caused by environmental impacts and alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. In addition to claims relating to our current facilities, we may also be subject to potential liability in connection with the environmental condition of facilities that we previously owned and operated, regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during, or after the time we owned or operated these facilities. If we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause (or caused) harm to the environment or persons, that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil penalties and damages against us. The incurrence of a material environmental liability or a material judgment in any action for personal injury or property damage related to environmental matters could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.\nFederal, state, regional, and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit GHG emissions. In 2015, the EPA issued the Clean Power Plan, which is a final rule that regulates GHG emissions from existing generating units, as well as a proposed federal plan as an alternative to state compliance plans. The EPA also issued final performance standards for modified and reconstructed generating units, as well as for new fossil-fueled power plants. With the January 2017 change in the Federal Executive Administration, the legal and regulatory future of federal GHG regulations, including the Clean Power Plan, faces increased uncertainty. We are continuing to analyze the GHG emission profile of our electric generation resources and to work with other stakeholders to determine the potential impacts to our operations of the Clean Power Plan, any successor rule, and federal GHG\n2016 Form 10-K\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nregulations in general. In October 2015, numerous states (including Wisconsin and Michigan), trade associations, and private parties filed lawsuits challenging the Clean Power Plan, including a request to stay the implementation of the final rule pending the outcome of these legal challenges. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the stay request, but in February 2016, the Supreme Court stayed the effectiveness of the Clean Power Plan rules until disposition of the litigation in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and to the extent that further appellate review is sought, at the Supreme Court. In addition, in February 2016, the Governor of Wisconsin issued Executive Order 186, which prohibits state agencies, departments, boards, commissions, or other state entities from developing or promoting the development of a state plan. The Clean Power Plan or its successor is not expected to result in significant additional compliance costs, including capital expenditures, but may impact how we operate our existing fossil-fueled power plants and biomass facility.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be allowed to fully recover costs incurred to comply with the Clean Power Plan or other federal regulations, or that cost recovery will not be delayed or otherwise conditioned. The Clean Power Plan and any other related regulations that may be adopted in the future, at either the federal or state level, may cause our environmental compliance spending to differ materially from the amounts currently estimated. In December 2016, Michigan enacted Act 342, which requires additional renewable energy requirements beyond 2015. The new legislation retains the 10% renewable energy portfolio requirement for years 2016 through 2018, increases the requirement to 12.5% for years 2019 through 2020, and increases the requirement to 15.0% for 2021. These regulations, as well as changes in the fuel markets and advances in technology, could make some of our electric generating units uneconomic to maintain or operate, and could affect unit retirement and replacement decisions. These regulations could also adversely affect our future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nIn addition, our natural gas delivery systems and natural gas storage fields may generate fugitive gas as a result of normal operations and as a result of excavation, construction, and repair. Fugitive gas typically vents to the atmosphere and consists primarily of methane. CO2 is also a byproduct of natural gas consumption. As a result, future regulation of GHG emissions could increase the price of natural gas, restrict the use of natural gas, and adversely affect our ability to operate our natural gas facilities. A significant increase in the price of natural gas may increase rates for our natural gas customers, which could reduce natural gas demand.\nWe may be negatively impacted by changes in federal income tax policy.\nWe are impacted by United States federal income tax policy. Both the new Federal Executive Administration and the Republicans in the House of Representatives have made public statements in support of comprehensive tax reform, including significant changes to corporate income tax laws. These proposed changes include, among other things, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the immediate deductibility of 100% of capital expenditures, and the elimination of the interest expense deduction. We are currently unable to predict whether these reform discussions will result in any significant changes to existing tax laws, or if any such changes would have a cumulative positive or negative impact on us. However, it is possible that changes in the United States federal income tax laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For example, any changes that eliminate the interest expense deduction, particularly to the extent applicable to existing indebtedness at our holding company and non-utility operations, could have a negative impact on our financial condition. In addition, the immediate deductibility of capital expenditures could have the effect of reducing growth in our regulated rate base, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur electric utilities could be subject to higher costs and penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards.\nOur electric utilities are subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC. The critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cyber security assets. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards could subject our electric utilities to higher operating costs. If our electric utilities were ever found to be in noncompliance with the mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.\nProvisions of the Wisconsin Utility Holding Company Act limit our ability to invest in non-utility businesses and could deter takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay a premium for our common stock.\nUnder the Wisconsin Utility Holding Company Act, we remain subject to certain restrictions that have the potential of limiting our diversification into non-utility businesses. Under the Act, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system generally may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates in the system, subject to certain exceptions.\nIn addition, the Act precludes the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting shares of a holding company of a Wisconsin public utility unless the PSCW has first determined that the acquisition is in the best interests of utility customers, investors, and the public. This\n2016 Form 10-K\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nprovision and other requirements of the Act may delay or reduce the likelihood of a sale or change of control of WEC Energy Group. As a result, stockholders may be deprived of opportunities to sell some or all of their shares of our common stock at prices that represent a premium over market prices.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nOur operations are subject to risks arising from the reliability of our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas infrastructure facilities, and other facilities, as well as the reliability of third-party transmission providers.\nOur financial performance depends on the successful operation of our electric generation and natural gas and electric distribution facilities. The operation of these facilities involves many risks, including operator error and the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. Potential breakdown or failure may occur due to severe weather; catastrophic events (i.e., fires, earthquakes, explosions, tornadoes, floods, droughts, pandemic health events, etc.); significant changes in water levels in waterways; fuel supply or transportation disruptions; accidents; employee labor disputes; construction delays or cost overruns; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material, and/or labor; performance below expected levels; operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements; terrorist attacks; or cyber security intrusions. Any of these events could lead to substantial financial losses.\nBecause our electric generation facilities are interconnected with third-party transmission facilities, the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by events impacting their systems. Unplanned outages at our power plants may reduce our revenues or cause us to incur significant costs if we are required to operate our higher cost electric generators or purchase replacement power to satisfy our obligations, and could result in additional maintenance expenses.\nInsurance, warranties, performance guarantees, or recovery through the regulatory process may not cover any or all of these lost revenues or increased expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to various conditions that can result in fluctuations in energy sales to customers, including customer growth and general economic conditions in our service areas, varying weather conditions, and energy conservation efforts.\nOur results of operations and cash flows are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas, which can vary greatly based upon:\n\u2022\nFluctuations in customer growth and general economic conditions in our service areas. Customer growth and energy use can be negatively impacted by population declines as well as economic factors in our service territories, including job losses, decreases in income, and business closings. Our electric and natural gas utilities are impacted by economic cycles and the competitiveness of the commercial and industrial customers we serve. Any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products. These risks could directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas as well as the need for additional power generation and generating facilities. We could also be exposed to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs if customers are unable to pay their bills.\n\u2022\nWeather conditions. Demand for electricity is greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. In addition, demand for natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. As a result, our overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, milder temperatures during the summer cooling season and during the winter heating season may result in lower revenues and net income.\n\u2022\nOur customers' continued focus on energy conservation and ability to meet their own energy needs. Our customers' use of electricity and natural gas has decreased as a result of individual conservation efforts, including the use of more energy efficient technologies. These conservation efforts could continue. Customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income and increases in energy prices. Conservation of energy can be influenced by certain federal and state programs that are intended to influence how consumers use energy. In addition, several states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, have adopted energy efficiency targets to reduce energy consumption by certain dates.\nAs part of our planning process, we estimate the impacts of changes in customer growth and general economic conditions, weather, and customer energy conservation efforts, but risks still remain. Any of these matters, as well as any regulatory delay in adjusting rates as a result of reduced sales from effective conservation measures or the adoption of new technologies, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n2016 Form 10-K\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nWe are actively involved with several significant capital projects, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect project costs and completion of construction projects.\nOur business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in, among other things, capital improvements to our electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, natural gas storage, and other projects, including projects for environmental compliance. In addition, WBS has various capital projects that are primarily related to the development of software applications used to support our utilities.\nAchieving the intended benefits of any large construction project is subject to many uncertainties, some of which we will have limited or no control over, that could adversely affect project costs and completion time. These risks include, but are not limited to, the ability to adhere to established budgets and time frames; the availability of labor or materials at estimated costs; the ability of contractors to perform under their contracts; strikes; adverse weather conditions; potential legal challenges; changes in applicable laws or regulations; other governmental actions; continued public and policymaker support for such projects; and events in the global economy. In addition, certain of these projects require the approval of our regulators. If construction of commission-approved projects should materially and adversely deviate from the schedules, estimates, and projections on which the approval was based, our regulators may deem the additional capital costs as imprudent and disallow recovery of them through rates.\nTo the extent that delays occur, costs become unrecoverable, or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nAdvances in technology could make our electric generating facilities less competitive.\nResearch and development activities are ongoing for new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption. These technologies include renewable energy, customer-oriented generation, energy storage, and energy efficiency. We generate power at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a competitive cost. There are distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells, which have become more cost competitive. It is possible that legislation or regulations could be adopted supporting the use of these technologies. There is also a risk that advances in technology will continue to reduce the costs of these alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of central station power production. If these technologies become cost competitive and achieve economies of scale, our market share could be eroded, and the value of our generating facilities could be reduced. Advances in technology could also change the channels through which our electric customers purchase or use power, which could reduce our sales and revenues or increase our expenses.\nOur operations are subject to risks beyond our control, including but not limited to, cyber security intrusions, terrorist attacks, acts of war, or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information.\nWe face the risk of terrorist attacks and cyber intrusions, both threatened and actual, against our generation facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, our information and technology systems, and network infrastructure, including that of third parties on which we rely, any of which could result in a full or partial disruption of our ability to generate, transmit, purchase, or distribute electricity or natural gas or cause environmental repercussions. Any operational disruption or environmental repercussions could result in a significant decrease in our revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe operate in an industry that requires the use of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which control an interconnected system of generation, distribution, and transmission systems shared with third parties. A successful physical or cyber security intrusion may occur despite our security measures or those that we require our vendors to take, which include compliance with reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection standards. Successful cyber security intrusions, including those targeting the electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and electric and natural gas transmission, distribution, and storage systems, could disrupt our operations and result in loss of service to customers. These intrusions may cause unplanned outages at our power plants, which may reduce our revenues or cause us to incur significant costs if we are required to operate our higher cost electric generators or purchase replacement power to satisfy our obligations, and could result in additional maintenance expenses. The risk of such intrusions may also increase our capital and operating costs as a result of having to implement increased security measures for protection of our information technology and infrastructure.\nWe face on-going threats to our assets and technology systems. Despite the implementation of strong security measures, all assets and systems are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to human error or physical or cyber security\n2016 Form 10-K\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nintrusions. If our assets or systems were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached and were not recovered in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform critical business functions, and sensitive and other data could be compromised.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers, stockholders, and employees, who expect that we will adequately protect such information. Security breaches may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of personally identifiable information may lead to potentially large costs to notify and protect the impacted persons, and/or could cause us to become subject to significant litigation, costs, liability, fines, or penalties, any of which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations as well as our reputation with customers, stockholders and regulators, among others. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs associated with governmental actions in response to such intrusions or to strengthen our information and electronic control systems. We may also need to obtain additional insurance coverage related to the threat of such intrusions.\nThe costs of repairing damage to our facilities, protecting personally identifiable information, and notifying impacted persons, as well as related legal claims, may not be recoverable in rates, may exceed the insurance limits on our insurance policies, or, in some cases, may not be covered by insurance.\nTransporting, distributing, and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\nInherent in natural gas distribution activities are a variety of hazards and operational risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, including third party damages, and mechanical problems, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to us. The location of natural gas pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. These activities may subject us to litigation or administrative proceedings from time to time, which could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against us, or be resolved on unfavorable terms.\nWe are a holding company and rely on the earnings of our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations.\nAs a holding company with no operations of our own, our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay amounts to us, whether through dividends or other payments. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any of our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose or for the payment of dividends on our common stock. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay amounts to us depends on their earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, and general financial condition, as well as regulatory limitations. Prior to distributing cash to us, our subsidiaries have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including, among others, debt service and preferred stock dividends. In addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay amounts to us depends on any statutory, regulatory, and/or contractual restrictions and limitations applicable to such subsidiary, which may include requirements to maintain specified levels of debt or equity ratios, working capital, or other assets. Our utility subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility commissions, which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met.\nWe may fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce.\nWe operate in an industry that requires many of our employees to possess unique technical skill sets. Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, the mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs. These operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In addition, current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us. Failure to hire and obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFailure of our counterparties to meet their obligations, including obligations under power purchase agreements, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements who owe us money, electricity, natural gas, or other commodities or services will not be able to perform their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to\n2016 Form 10-K\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nperform, we may be required to replace the underlying commitment at current market prices or we may be unable to meet all of our customers' electric and natural gas requirements unless or until alternative supply arrangements are put in place. In such event, we may incur losses, and our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into several power purchase agreements with non-affiliated companies, and continue to look for additional opportunities to enter into these agreements. Revenues are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations under the power purchase agreements. Although we have a comprehensive credit evaluation process and contractual protections, it is possible that one or more purchasers could fail to perform their obligations under the power purchase agreements. If this were to occur, we would expect that any operating and other costs that were initially allocated to a defaulting customer's power purchase agreement would be reallocated among our retail customers. To the extent there is any regulatory delay in adjusting rates, a customer default under a power purchase agreement could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to use tax credits, net operating losses, and/or charitable contribution carryforwards.\nWe have significantly reduced our consolidated federal and state income tax liability in the past through tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions available under the applicable tax codes. We have not fully used the allowed tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions in our previous tax filings. We may not be able to fully use the tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions available as carryforwards if our future federal and state taxable income and related income tax liability is insufficient to permit their use. In addition, any future disallowance of some or all of those tax credits, net operating losses, or charitable contribution carryforwards as a result of legislation or an adverse determination by one of the applicable taxing jurisdictions could materially affect our tax obligations and financial results.\nThe acquisition of Integrys may not achieve its anticipated results, and we may be unable to integrate operations as expected.\nThe Merger Agreement was entered into with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of the two companies can continue to be integrated in an efficient, effective, and timely manner.\nIt is possible that the remaining integration efforts could take longer and be more costly than anticipated, and could result in the loss of valuable employees; the disruption of ongoing businesses, processes, and systems; or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies, and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction as and when expected. Although we expect that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses of the two companies, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time, we may not achieve this net benefit in the near term, or at all. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nWe have recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect financial results.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential for impairment. If goodwill is deemed to be impaired, we may be required to incur material non-cash charges that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Economic and Market Volatility\nOur business is dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets.\nWe rely on access to credit and capital markets to support our capital requirements, including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements, to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations. We have historically secured funds from a variety of sources, including the issuance of short-term and long-term debt securities. Successful implementation of our long-term business strategies, including capital investment, is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets, including the banking and commercial paper markets, on competitive terms and rates. In addition, we rely on committed bank credit agreements as back-up liquidity, which allows us to access the low cost commercial paper markets.\n2016 Form 10-K\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nOur or our subsidiaries' access to the credit and capital markets could be limited, or our or our subsidiaries' cost of capital significantly increased, due to any of the following risks and uncertainties:\n\u2022\nA rating downgrade;\n\u2022\nAn economic downturn or uncertainty;\n\u2022\nPrevailing market conditions and rules;\n\u2022\nConcerns over foreign economic conditions;\n\u2022\nChanges in tax policy;\n\u2022\nWar or the threat of war; and\n\u2022\nThe overall health and view of the utility and financial institution industries.\nIf any of these risks or uncertainties limit our access to the credit and capital markets or significantly increase our cost of capital, it could limit our ability to implement, or increase the costs of implementing, our business plan, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, and could limit our ability to sustain our current common stock dividend level.\nA downgrade in our or any of our subsidiaries' credit ratings could negatively affect our or our subsidiaries' ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or require the posting of collateral.\nThere are a number of factors that impact our and our subsidiaries' credit ratings, including, but not limited to, capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, and other requirements for capital. We or any of our subsidiaries could experience a downgrade in ratings if the rating agencies determine that the level of business or financial risk of us, our utilities, or the utility industry has deteriorated. Changes in rating methodologies by the rating agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings.\nAny downgrade by the rating agencies could:\n\u2022\nIncrease borrowing costs under certain existing credit facilities;\n\u2022\nRequire the payment of higher interest rates in future financings and possibly reduce the pool of creditors;\n\u2022\nDecrease funding sources by limiting our or our subsidiaries' access to the commercial paper market;\n\u2022\nLimit the availability of adequate credit support for our subsidiaries' operations; and\n\u2022\nTrigger collateral requirements in various contracts.\nFluctuating commodity prices could negatively impact our electric and natural gas utility operations.\nOur operating and liquidity requirements are impacted by changes in the forward and current market prices of natural gas, coal, electricity, renewable energy credits, and ancillary services.\nOur electric utilities burn natural gas in several of their electric generation plants and as a supplemental fuel at several coal-fired plants. In many instances the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas. The cost of natural gas may increase because of disruptions in the supply of natural gas due to a curtailment in production or distribution, international market conditions, the demand for natural gas, and the availability of shale gas and potential regulations affecting its accessibility.\nFor Wisconsin retail electric customers, our utilities bear the risk for the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs within a symmetrical 2% fuel tolerance band compared to the forecast of fuel and purchased power costs established in their respective rate structures. Our natural gas utilities receive dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs.\nChanges in commodity prices could result in:\n\u2022\nHigher working capital requirements, particularly related to natural gas inventory, accounts receivable, and cash collateral postings;\n\u2022\nReduced profitability to the extent that lower revenues, increased bad debt, and interest expense are not recovered through rates;\n\u2022\nHigher rates charged to our customers, which could impact our competitive position;\n\u2022\nReduced demand for energy, which could impact revenues and operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nShutting down of generation facilities if the cost of generation exceeds the market price for electricity.\n2016 Form 10-K\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nWe may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which could limit our ability to operate our coal-fired facilities and engage in opportunity sales.\nWe are dependent on coal for much of our electric generating capacity. Although we generally carry sufficient coal inventory at our generating facilities to protect against an interruption or decline in supply, there can be no assurance that the inventory levels will be adequate. While we have coal supply and transportation contracts in place, we cannot assure that the counterparties to these agreements will be able to fulfill their obligations to supply coal to us or that we will be able to take delivery of all the coal volume contracted for. The suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to us, or we may experience operational problems or constraints that prevent us from taking delivery. In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to us under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. Furthermore, demand for coal can impact its availability and cost. If we are unable to obtain our coal requirements under our coal supply and transportation contracts, we may be required to purchase coal at higher prices or we may be forced to reduce generation at our coal-fired units and replace this lost generation through additional power purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. There is no guarantee that we would be able to fully recover any increased costs in rates or that recovery would not otherwise be delayed, either of which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nOur electric generation frequently exceeds our customer load. When this occurs, we generally sell the excess generation into the MISO Energy Markets. If we do not have an adequate supply of coal for our coal-fired units or are unable to run our lower cost units, we may lose the ability to engage in these opportunity sales, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe use of derivative contracts could result in financial losses.\nWe use derivative instruments such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards to manage commodity price exposure. We could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, although the hedging programs of our utilities must be approved by the various state commissions, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the value of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. Changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\nRestructuring in the regulated energy industry and competition in the retail and wholesale markets could have a negative impact on our business and revenues.\nThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant structural changes. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant adverse financial impact on us.\nCertain jurisdictions in which we operate, including Michigan and Illinois, have adopted retail choice. Under Michigan law, our retail customers may choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. The law limits customer choice to 10% of our Michigan retail load. The iron ore mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is excluded from this cap. When a customer switches to an alternative electric supplier, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions for the customer. Although Illinois has adopted retail choice, there is currently little or no impact on the net income of our Illinois utilities as they still earn a distribution charge for transporting the natural gas for these customers. It is uncertain whether retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin or Minnesota.\nThe FERC continues to support the existing RTOs that affect the structure of the wholesale market within these RTOs. In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO implemented bid-based energy markets that are part of the MISO Energy Markets. The MISO Energy Markets rules require that all market participants submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. MISO then calculates the most efficient solution for all of the bids and offers made into the market that day and establishes an LMP that reflects the market price for energy. As a participant in the MISO Energy Markets, we are required to follow MISO's instructions when dispatching generating units to support MISO's responsibility for maintaining stability of the transmission system. MISO also implemented an ancillary services market for operating reserves that schedules energy and ancillary services at the same time as part of the energy market, allowing for more efficient use of generation assets in the MISO market. These market designs continue to have the potential to increase the costs of transmission, the costs associated with inefficient generation dispatching, the costs of participation in the MISO Energy Markets, and the costs associated with estimated payment settlements.\n2016 Form 10-K\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nThe FERC rules related to transmission are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale electricity markets among regulated utilities, non-utility generators, wholesale power marketers, and brokers by providing greater flexibility and more choices to wholesale customers, including initiatives designed to encourage the integration of renewable sources of supply. In addition, along with transactions contemplating physical delivery of energy, financial laws and regulations impact hedging and trading based on futures contracts and derivatives that are traded on various commodities exchanges, as well as over-the-counter. Technology changes in the power and fuel industries also have significant impacts on wholesale transactions and related costs. We currently cannot predict the impact of these and other developments or the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand, which are driven by factors beyond our control.\nWe may experience poor investment performance of benefit plan holdings due to changes in assumptions and market conditions.\nWe have significant obligations related to pension and OPEB plans. If we are unable to successfully manage our benefit plan assets and medical costs, our cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOur cost of providing these plans is dependent upon a number of factors, including actual plan experience, changes made to the plans, and assumptions concerning the future. Types of assumptions include earnings on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, estimated withdrawals by retirees, and our required or voluntary contributions to the plans. Plan assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield returns that fall below projected return rates. In addition, medical costs for both active and retired employees may increase at a rate that is significantly higher than we currently anticipate. Our funding requirements could be impacted by a decline in the market value of plan assets, changes in interest rates, changes in demographics (including the number of retirements), or changes in life expectancy assumptions.\nWe may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses.\nOur ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting our business; international, national, state, or local events; and the financial condition of insurers. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all or at rates or terms similar to those presently available to us. In addition, our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.", "PERMNO": 23536, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "WEC"}
