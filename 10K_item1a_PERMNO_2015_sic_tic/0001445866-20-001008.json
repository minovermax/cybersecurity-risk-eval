{"cik": "851726", "company": "Santa Fe Gold CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-07-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties involving precious metal prices, explorations costs and government oversight. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before purchasing the Company\u2019s common shares. The occurrence of any of the following events could negatively affect our business operations and our results of operations. If these events occur, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common shares could decline, and shareholders may lose part or even all of their investment.\nRisk Associated with Our Business\nAll of our properties are in the exploration stage. There can be no assurance that we will establish the existence of any metal or mineral resource on any of our properties in commercially exploitable quantities. Until we can do so, we are not likely to earn any revenues from these properties, and our business could fail.\nWe have not established that any of our mining properties contain commercially viable mineral or metal reserves. Our ability to conclude that an individual prospect has any viable mineral or metal reserves requires further efforts and any funds that we spend on exploration may be lost. Even if we do eventually discover commercially viable mineral or metal reserves on one or more of our properties, there can be no assurances that we will develop producing mines and extract those resources. Both mineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk and few properties, which are explored and mined, are ultimately developed into commercially viable producing mines.\nThe commercial viability of an established mineral deposit will depend on a large number of factors including, by way of example, the size, grade and other attributes of the mineral or metal deposit, the proximity of the resource to infrastructure, roads and a point for shipping, government regulation and market prices. Most of these factors will be beyond our control, and any of them could increase costs and make extraction of any identified metal or mineral resource unprofitable.\nEven if commercial viability of a mineral or metal deposit is established, we may be required to expend significant resources until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to both establish proven and probable reserves as well as those required to implement permitting and drilling operations. Because of these uncertainties, investors have no assurances that our drilling programs will result in commercially viable operations nor that we will be successful in the establishment or expansion of any resources or reserves. Any failure in our ability to successfully execute on the forgoing will adversely impact our business results of operations, in turn leading to losses for investors.\nUnder SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, a \u201cfinal\u201d or \u201cbankable\u201d feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves, and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. In addition, the terms \u201cmineral resource\u201d, \u201cmeasured mineral resource\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resource\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resource\u201d are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of potential mineral deposits that may be considered mineral resources will ever be converted into reserves. Our mineral resources have a great amount of\nuncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. Our properties currently do not contain any known proven or probable ore reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7 reporting standards. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any mineral resources will ever be converted into SEC Guide 7 compliant reserves.\nIf we establish the existence of commercially viable mineral or metal resources on any of our properties in a commercially exploitable quantity, we will require additional capital in order to develop the property into a producing mine. If we cannot raise this additional capital, we will not be able to exploit the resource, and our business could suffer.\nIf we do discover mineral and metal resources in commercially exploitable quantities on any of our properties, we will be required to expend substantial sums of money to establish the extent of the resource, engage in drilling operations and develop extraction and processing facilities (or effect acceptable shipping arrangements therefor) and infrastructure. We do not have adequate capital to develop necessary facilities and infrastructure and will need to raise additional funds. Although we may derive substantial benefits from the discovery of commercially exploitable deposits, there can be no assurance that such a resource will be large enough to justify commercial operations or that we will be able to raise the funds required for development and/or processing on a timely basis. If we cannot raise the necessary capital or complete the necessary facilities, infrastructure, development, processing or related activities, our business may fail and we may be forced to curtail or cease operations.\nOur exploration and extraction activities may not be commercially successful.\nWhile we believe there are positive indicators that our properties contain commercially exploitable minerals and metals, such belief has been based solely on preliminary tests that we have conducted and data provided by third parties. There can be no assurance that the tests and data upon which we have relied are correct or accurate. Moreover, mineral exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and is frequently non-productive. Unusual or unexpected geologic formations and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor are risks involved in the conduct of most exploration programs. The success of mineral exploration and development is determined in part by the following factors:\n\u00b7the identification of potential mineralization based on analysis;\n\u00b7the availability of permits;\n\u00b7the quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise; and\n\u00b7the capital available for mining operations.\nSubstantial expenditures and time are required to establish existing proven and probable reserves through drilling and analysis, and to develop the mines and facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining. Whether a mineral or metal deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, which include, without limitation: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; metal prices, which fluctuate widely; and government regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection; and general economic factors, which include, without limitation, market prices for certain minerals or metals, labor costs, the impact of technological innovations on the supply and demand for the commodities we mine. If our exploration and extraction activities are not successful, our business will likely fail.\nThere may be challenges to the title of our mineral properties.\nThe Company has acquired certain rights to its properties by unpatented claims, ownership of land or by lease from those owning the property and its patented claims are limited. The validity of title to many types of natural resource property depends upon numerous circumstances and factual matters (many of which are not discoverable of record or by other readily available means) and is subject to many uncertainties of existing law and its application. There can be no assurance that the validity of our titles to our properties will be upheld or that third parties will not otherwise seek to invalidate those rights. In the event the validity of our title to any of these properties are not upheld, such events would have a material adverse effect on us.\nMineral operations are subject to applicable law and government regulations. Even if we discover a mineral resource in a commercially exploitable quantity, these laws and regulations could restrict or prohibit the exploitation of them. If we cannot exploit any mineral resources that we discover on our properties, our business may fail.\nBoth mineral exploration and extraction require permits from various foreign, federal, state, provincial and local governmental authorities and are governed by laws and regulations, including those with respect to prospecting, mine development, mineral production, transport, export, taxation, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety and other matters.\nCompanies, such as ours that plan to engage in exploration and extraction activities, often experience increased costs and delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. Issuance of permits for our activities is subject to the discretion of government authorities, and we may be unable to obtain or maintain such permits. Permits required for future exploration or development may not be obtainable on reasonable terms, on a timely basis or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any of the permits required for the continued exploration or development of our mineral properties or for the construction and operation of a mine on our properties at economically viable costs. If we cannot accomplish these objectives, our business could face difficulty and/or fail.\nWe believe that we are in compliance with all material laws and regulations that currently apply to our activities but there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. Current laws and regulations could be amended and we might not be able to comply with them, as amended. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain all permits necessary for our future operations, or that we will be able to obtain them on reasonable terms. To the extent such approvals are required and are not obtained, we may be delayed or prohibited from proceeding with planned exploration or development of our mineral properties.\nEnvironmental hazards unknown to us, which have been caused by previous or existing owners or operators of the properties, may exist on the properties in which we hold an interest. It is possible that our properties could be located on or near the site of a Federal Superfund cleanup project. Although we endeavor to avoid such sites, it is possible that environmental cleanup or other environmental restoration procedures could remain to be completed or mandated by law, causing unpredictable and unexpected liabilities to arise. We are not currently aware of any environmental issues or litigation relating to any of our current or former properties but if they were to arise, we could face significant liability that would negatively impact our operations that would cause our business to fail.\nCompetition in the mining industry is intense, and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete.\nCompetition in the mining industry for desirable properties, investment capital, equipment and personnel are intense. Numerous companies headquartered in the United States, Canada and elsewhere throughout the world compete for properties on a global basis. We are currently an insignificant participant in the mining industry due, in part, to our limited financial and personnel resources. We may be unable to: i) attract the necessary investment capital or a joint venture partner to fully develop our mineral properties, ii) acquire other desirable properties, iii) attract and hire necessary personnel, or iv) purchase necessary equipment.\nThe nature of mineral exploration and production activities involves a high degree of risk and the possibility of uninsured losses.\nThe business of exploring for and extracting minerals and metals involves a high degree of risk. Few properties are ultimately developed into producing mines. Whether a mineral deposit can be commercially viable depends upon a number of factors, including the particular attributes of the deposit, including size, grade and proximity to infrastructure, metal prices, which can be highly variable, and government regulation, including environmental and reclamation obligations. These factors are not within our control. Uncertainties as to the metallurgical amenability of any minerals discovered may not warrant the mining of these metals or minerals on the basis of available technology. Our operations are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and developing mineral or metal properties, such as, but not limited to:\n\u00b7encountering unusual or unexpected formations;\n\u00b7environmental pollution;\n\u00b7personal injury, flooding and landslides;\n\u00b7variations in grades of minerals or metals;\n\u00b7labor disputes; and\n\u00b7a decline in the price of gold, silver or copper.\nWe currently have no insurance to guard against any of these risks. If we determine that capitalized costs associated with any of our mineral interests are not likely to be recovered, we would incur a write-down on our investment in such property interests. All of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent which are not recoverable. The payment of any liabilities that arise from any such occurrence would have a material, adverse impact on our Company.\nOur exploration and development activities are subject to environmental risks, which could expose us to significant liability and delay, suspension or termination of our operations.\nThe exploration, possible future development and production phases of our business will be subject to federal, state and local environmental regulation. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set out limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Future changes in environmental regulations, if any, may adversely affect our operations. If we fail to comply with any of the applicable environmental laws, regulations or permit requirements, we could face regulatory or judicial sanctions. Penalties imposed by either the courts or administrative bodies could delay or stop our operations or require a considerable capital expenditure. Although we intend to comply with all environmental laws and permitting obligations in conducting our business, there is always a possibility that those opposed to exploration and mining may attempt to interfere with our operations, whether by legal process, regulatory process or otherwise.\nWe could be subject to environmental lawsuits.\nNeighboring landowners, other third parties and governmental entities could file claims based on environmental statutes and common law for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste material into the environment on or around our properties. There can be no assurance that our defense of such claims will be successful. A successful claim against us could have an adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nRisks Associated with our Company\nLitigation with respect to Mr. Laws may not result in additional funds being obtained to reduce his indebtedness owed to the Company.\nThe Company has determined by its records that Mr. Laws initially owes us $1,197,198 ; after deducting the sum of $485,966 collected from him, the total amount Laws owed prior to collection of the Company is $711,232 (the \u201cMissing Funds\u201d) plus penalties, professional fees and accrued interest. The Company has commenced litigation and collection efforts, including foreclosure on pledged assets to collect these funds. Mr. Laws filed a petition for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and has sought to use that proceeding to challenge the Company\u2019s rights to foreclose on certain property that was pledged as security in connection with a promissory note he provided to the Company. That promissory note was issued by Mr. Laws when it was discovered that he owed the Company and payment of the amount he owed the Company was demanded. Based on the position our legal counsel has taken, we believe that Mr. Laws\u2019 challenge to the Company\u2019s security interest will not be supported, nevertheless there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to collect the balance of the Missing Funds from Mr. Laws. Failure to collect the balance of funds from Mr. Laws will adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, including the impact from loss of the funds themselves, although that adverse effect has already been realized and the Company has been operating without the balance of the Missing Funds since they were absent in 2017. As a result of Mr. Laws\u2019 actions, the Company will have the additional expenses associated with the restating of its financial statements, which is included in this filing made on Form 10-K. There were also expenses associated with engaging the special committee to conduct a forensic review of the Company\u2019s books and records in connection with the transactions giving rise to the Missing Funds. Additionally, the Company incurred and may continue to incur the costs associated with engaging counsel to represent the Company in this matter and in the investigations. That is, the investigation(s) or \u201cpre-investigation(s)\u201d that have been conducted or may be conducted by the SEC and DOJ; as well as the costs to settle any matters related thereto, may be significant. The Missing Funds together with the additional expenses that may arise as a result of Mr. Laws\u2019 actions in the aggregate are likely to be substantial. To the extent that they are substantial and that the Company is unable to collect any further sums from Mr. Laws, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe DOJ and the SEC investigated or are currently investigating the Company, including financial transactions involving Thomas Laws.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) have, or may have, each initiated investigation into the Company, its officers, directors, and potentially others, resulting from the Laws transactions. The SEC has obtained a formal order to investigate the Company with respect to Laws, and while we understand that the DOJ investigation lead to Mr. Laws plea of guilty to various charges, including charges based on his actions alleged by the Company, we also understand that Mr. Laws is currently awaiting sentencing in connection with his plea(s) of guilty. The Company does not anticipate collecting a material amount due from Mr. Laws in his criminal proceedings. However, it believes that if it is ultimately successfully in recovering any further sums from Mr. Laws, beyond what it has already recovered, that any additional recovery will be determined by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.\nThe SEC investigation surrounding the financial transactions involving Thomas Laws may result in other officers, directors or third-parties or the Company being subject to related or different enforcement actions.\nNone of funds that Mr. Laws owes the Company were ever received by anyone other than Mr. Laws, nor was there ever any evidence found (after a forensic review of the Company\u2019s books and records by an independent special committee) that anyone else benefited in any way from the Laws transaction(s). However, notwithstanding the forgoing, the SEC continues to investigate this matter, and the Company is aware that one of our officers is the subject of the investigation and that officer is in settlement discussions with the Commission to bring closure to the investigation. If settlement terms are not reached by the parties, there would likely be an adversarial proceeding commenced by the Commission. Balanced against the certainty that defending would be time consuming and costly, settlement (under reasonable terms) is seen as preferable. There is no assurance that this investigation will not include other affiliates of the Company or the Company itself, and it can\u2019t be predicted as to where this investigation may lead or what the Commission might ultimately decide to seek in terms of judicial relief. If the Commission brings an enforcement action against any of the forgoing, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company and its operations.\nThe SEC could take the position that we have paid impermissible finders\u2019 fees or that we aided and abetted a violation of the registration requirements by paying compensation to an individual acting as an unregistered broker dealer.\nIn the past, we paid finders\u2019 fees in connection with the placement of certain shares of our common stock to an individual who is a non-U.S. resident. While the Company is confident that it met the factors set forth in the SEC Paul Anka No Action Letter (Issued July 24, 1991) (the seminal No Action Letter where transaction based compensation for finders has been approved by the Commission), by definition, the facts set forth in the aforementioned No Action Letter vary from those facts in all other situations including those that were present when finder\u2019s fees were paid by the Company. As such, the SEC is not compelled to find the letter applicable in other situations and with other fact patterns. Nevertheless, we believe that the facts in the Company\u2019s case are more compelling that those set forth in the Anka letter. The issuer in the Anka Letter did not have a pre-existing relationship with investors, whereas the Company not only had a pre-existing relationship with investors, the investors were almost entirely existing shareholders of the Company. Although, (a) the finder did not have involvement in negotiating or structuring transactions with investors (the Company\u2019s investors had already determined to purchase, no sales material was provided by the finder with the sole exception of a blank subscription agreement that the finder was provided by the Company and that was provided along with the per share price to the investor as a courtesy); (b) the finder did not value or opine as to the Company\u2019s common stock\u2019s value and did not participate in negotiating on behalf of the investor or the Company; (c) the finder was not in the business of brokering transactions and its activity, as a finder, was isolated to helping the Company and again, (d) although fees were paid in connection with the sales of the Company\u2019s common stock, this was disclosed on the subscription agreements and the other items were as limited or more limited than those that were present that gave rise to the SEC\u2019s Paul Anka No-Action Letter. Further out of an abundance of caution, no commissions or finder\u2019s fees have been paid in connection with the placement of common stock subsequent to August 2018. Nevertheless, if the SEC were to disagree with the Company\u2019s analysis, the Company would be in a position to where it would be required to defend its position or to reach a settlement with the Commission, either of which could be costly and have a negative impact on the Company and its results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance the Company will successfully implement its plans.\nWe have historically incurred net losses from operations and we expect losses in the future periods. Our likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the formation of a new business which seeks to obtain funds to finance its operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that we will successfully implement any of our plans (including without limitation production of any mine, shipping ore to a smelter or otherwise commercially exploit our properties) in a timely or effective manner or that we will ever be profitable. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will choose to continue to develop any of our current properties because we intend to consider and, as appropriate, to divest ourselves of properties that may no longer be a strategic fit to our business strategy or that we lack the necessary capital to develop. If we lack the capital to implement our plans, we will be forced to curtail or cease operations.\nMineral exploration and development inherently involves significant and irreducible financial risks. We may suffer from the failure to find and develop profitable mineral deposits.\nThe exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves significant financial risks, which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. Unprofitable efforts may result from the failure to discover mineral deposits. Even if mineral deposits are found, such deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Mining companies rely on consultants and others for exploration, development, construction and operating expertise.\nSubstantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. The economic feasibility of any development project is based upon, among other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates and capital and operating costs of such development projects, and metals prices. Development projects are also subject to the completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate financing.\nOnce a mineral deposit is developed, whether it will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection; and mineral prices. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nSignificant investment risks and operational costs are associated with our exploration activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect our business.\nMineral exploration, particularly for gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. If mineralization is discovered, it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Development projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Development project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual cash operating costs and economic returns of any and all development projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nAny of our future acquisitions may result in significant risks, which may adversely affect our business.\nAn important element of our business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of operating mines, properties and businesses or interests therein within our geographical area of interest. While it is our practice to engage independent mining consultants to assist in evaluating and making acquisitions, any mining properties or interests therein we may acquire may not be developed profitably or, if profitable when acquired, that profitability might not be sustained. In connection with any future acquisitions, we may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing shareholders. We cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of our business or our common stock. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions, may impact the price of our common stock and negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to find and acquire new mineral properties is uncertain. Accordingly, our prospects are uncertain for the future growth of our business.\nBecause mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, we may seek to replace and expand our future ore reserves, if any. Identifying promising mining properties is difficult and speculative. Furthermore, we encounter strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing gold. Many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do. Consequently, we may be unable to replace and expand future ore reserves through the acquisition of new mining properties or interests therein on terms we consider acceptable. As a result, our future revenues from the sale of gold or other precious metals, if any, may decline, resulting in lower income and reduced growth.\nDelaware law and our by-laws protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits.\nDelaware law provides that our directors will not be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages except for certain types of conduct as directors. Our by-laws require us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require us to use our assets to defend our directors and officers against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.\nWe are in the preliminary stages of mining the Jim Crow Mine.\nThe Company is in the preliminary stages of mining operations in the Jim Crow Mine and anticipates the first shipment of ore during the second or third quarter of calendar 2020. The Company currently does not have a long-term shipping contract and there can be no assurances that shipping to this smelter will continue in future periods or that the Company will receive revenue therefrom. There can be no assurances of continued mining operations at the Jim Crow Mine or the shipment of ore to the smelter, any of which would adversely impact investors.\nDismissal of Bankruptcy Proceeding and Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization did not result in the elimination of Company liabilities.\nAfter the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition in June 2016 and the sale of the Company\u2019s significant assets, the Company emerged with nominal assets and remained liable for all commitments and debts that then were outstanding. Santa Fe Gold Barbados, The Lordsburg Mining Company and AZCO are subsidiaries of the Company with nominal assets and all of their commitments and debts remain outstanding. The bankruptcy court set up a trust fund, funded by the activities of the Summit mine (main asset sold in bankruptcy proceedings) for five years and the trust funds will be distributed to certain unsecured creditors by an independent trustee. The Company failed to provide a plan of reorganization with the filing for protection under the Bankruptcy Code and as such, its debts were not discharged. The significant transactions that occurred upon emergence from bankruptcy were as follows:\n\u00b7The approximately $20 million of indebtedness outstanding on account of the Company\u2019s senior notes and unsecured claims were reinstated; and\n\u00b7The courts established a trust in April 2016 for the benefit of certain creditors. A profit interest was attached to the Summit mine with the benefit for certain creditors holding unsecured claims filed by each creditor.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company liabilities remaining after the emergence from bankruptcy will not materially impact the Company. The Company has no continuing commitment from any party to provide working capital, and there is no certainty that the Company will be able to raise sufficient capital to fund any or all existing liabilities as well as to fund its current business plan. The failure to raise needed capital may result in the curtailment or cessation of our business. Notwithstanding the emergence from Bankruptcy with the aforementioned liabilities, a significant portion of them became time barred from collection by virtue of the 2 year limitation period imposed by statute of limitations for the Provence of British Columbia and as such, upon receipt of a legal opinion coving the same, were written off and are no longer required to be reflected in the Company\u2019s financial statements as an enforceable liability. (See Item I Business - \u201cDismissal of Bankruptcy Proceeding and Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization.\u201d)\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect to incur substantial operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have had no revenues during the last two fiscal years, may not generate revenues this current fiscal year, and we are not currently profitable. We do not have sufficient capital to fund operations through June 30, 2020 and will need to raise additional funding to implement our business strategy. Even if we succeed in developing any of our properties, we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future. As the Company has no commitment for debt or equity financing, the Company will be reliant upon best efforts fund raising activities to provide sufficient working capital to fund current and future needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its best efforts capital raising efforts, and the failure to raise needed capital will result in the curtailment or cessation of our business.\nWe have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and properties.\nAny investment in the Company\u2019s securities should be considered a high-risk investment because investors will be placing funds at risk in an early stage business with unforeseen costs, expenses, competition, a history of operating losses and other problems, to which start-up ventures are often subject. Investors should not invest in the Company\u2019s securities unless they can afford to lose their entire investment. Your investment must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties encountered in establishing a new business in a highly competitive and mature industry. Our operating history does not provide a meaningful basis for an evaluation of our current prospects. Other than through conventional and typical exploration methods and procedures, we have no additional way to evaluate the likelihood of whether other properties contain commercial quantities of mineral or metal reserves or, if they do, if they will be operated successfully.\nIf we cannot raise additional funding, we will be unable to implement our business plan.\nSince we do not generate any revenues, we may not have sufficient financial resources ourselves, to undertake all planned development activities relating to our business plan. There can be no assurances that additional financing will be available to us or that if available, that it would be on terms acceptable to us. We do not have any commitments for debt or equity financing at this time, nor do we have credit facilities available with financial institutions or other third parties, and investors may lose their all of their investment if we are unable to secure such financing in a timely manner. As the Company has no commitment for debt or equity financing, the Company will be reliant upon its own best efforts fund raising activities to provide sufficient working capital to fund its current and future needs, as well as on the potential cash flow from operations. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in its best efforts capital raising or receive significant cash flow from operations; and the failure to generate needed working capital may result in the curtailment or cessation of its business, and losses for investors.\nOur resources may not be sufficient to manage our expected growth; failure to properly manage our potential growth would be detrimental to our business.\nEven if we obtain funding for operations, we may fail to adequately manage our anticipated future growth. Any growth in our operations will place a significant strain on our administrative, financial and operational resources, and increase demands on our management, as well as our operational and administrative systems, controls and other resources. There can be no assurances that our existing personnel, systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations in the future; or that we will be able to successfully implement appropriate measures consistent with our growth strategy. As part of this growth, we may have to implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base, and maintain close coordination among our staff. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to do so, or that if we are able to do so, we will be able to effectively integrate them into our existing staff and systems.\nIf we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. As with all expanding businesses, the potential exists that growth will occur rapidly. If we are unable to effectively manage this growth, our business and operating results could suffer. Anticipated growth in future operations may place a significant strain on management systems and resources. In addition, the integration of new personnel will continue to result in some disruption to ongoing operations. The ability to effectively manage growth in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning and management processes. We will need to continue to improve operational, financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, and will need to continue to expand, train and manage our work force.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely impact the Company.\nThe nature of our business, including our ability to continue our current activities depends, in large part, on the efforts of our key personnel, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. As previously mentioned, the SEC instituted a formal investigation against our former CEO and if it were to continue to seek enforcement action(s) against other individuals that are important to the Company, we could effectively lose the services of those individuals. This is because frequently with enforcement actions, the SEC seeks to bar individuals from serving as officers or directors or otherwise participating in certain activities for or on behalf of public companies, often five years and occasionally on a permanent basis. When the SEC seeks a \u201cbar\u201d against an individual, consent to a bar is generally one of the required terms of settlement insisted upon by the Commission.\nWe may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of our financial condition, our auditors have expressed doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern which may have an adverse impact on our relationship with third parties with whom we do business, and could make it challenging and difficult for us to raise additional debt or equity financing, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, it may be unable to realize the carrying value of its assets and to meet its liabilities as they become due.\nA substantial or extended decline in gold and silver prices would have a material adverse effect on the value of our assets, on our ability to raise capital and could result in lower than estimated economic returns.\nThe value of our assets, our ability to raise capital and any future economic returns are substantially dependent on the prices of gold and silver. Gold and silver prices fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence gold prices, for example, include:\n\u00b7gold sales or leasing by governments and central banks or changes in their monetary policy, including gold inventory management and reallocation of reserves;\n\u00b7speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold;\n\u00b7the relative strength of the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7expectations of the future rate of inflation;\n\u00b7interest rates;\n\u00b7changes to economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries;\n\u00b7geopolitical conflicts;\n\u00b7changes in industrial, jewelry or investment demand;\n\u00b7changes in supply from production, disinvestment and scrap; and\n\u00b7Forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur common stock is thinly traded, and there is no guarantee as to the prices at which the shares may trade.\nTrading of our common stock is quoted by OTC Markets Group, Inc., under the ticker symbol \u201cSFEG.\u201d Since the Company has not been current in its filings with the SEC, the Company has a \u201cstop sign\u201d associated with its trading symbol. Although, it will be removed when we are current in our SEC filings, in the interim period while this \u201cstop sign\u201d is posted by OTC Markets Group, it adversely impacts our ability to raise capital and provide for meaningful trading. We are in the process of filing past-due reports with the SEC and plan to become current in our filing obligations as soon as practicable. Thus, management views this as a short-term issue as of the date of the filing of this set of periodic reports filed on Form 10-K. Additionally, not being listed for trading on an established securities exchange has an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions, number of market makers and lack of security analysts\u2019 research coverage of the Company. This may result in systemically lower prices for your common stock than might otherwise be obtained if the Company had been listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ exchanges and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and ask prices that are quoted for our common stock. Historically, our common stock has been thinly traded, and there is no guarantee of the prices at which the shares will trade, or that there will be sufficient volume to allow stockholders to sell their shares without having an adverse effect on market prices.\nBecause our common stock is currently a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d it may be difficult to sell shares at times and prices that are acceptable.\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC. This document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the penny stock market. A broker must also give a purchaser, orally or in writing, bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson compensation, make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and obtain the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the purchase. The penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock. Because of these rules, many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions and there is less trading in penny stocks overall as a result. Accordingly, you may not always be able to resell shares of our common stock in ordinary transactions at times and prices that you feel are appropriate.\nThe sale of our common stock by existing stockholders may depress the price of our common stock due to the limited trading market that exists.\nAny sales of a significant amount of common stock by existing shareholders may depress the price otherwise causing the price of our common stock may decline.\nA small number of existing shareholders own a significant portion of our common stock, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of any shareholder vote.\nA relatively small number of shareholders hold large concentrations of shares and under our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law, the vote of a majority of the shares outstanding is generally required to approve most shareholder actions. As a result, these individuals and entities will be able to influence the outcome of shareholder votes for the foreseeable future, including votes concerning the election of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation or proposed mergers or other significant corporate transactions.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price and volume is highly volatile, limited and sporadic.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be exaggerated since the trading volume is volatile, limited, and sporadic. These fluctuations may or may not be based upon any business or operating results. Our common stock may experience similar or even more dramatic price and volume fluctuations in the future.\nThe Company will not pay dividends on its common stock.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on any shares of our capital stock, and we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Our current business plan is to retain any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant at that time. If we do not pay cash dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nOutstanding shares that are eligible for future sale could adversely impact a public trading market for our common stock.\nWe have offered and sold and will continue to offer and sell shares without registration under the Securities Act, through exemptions available under the Securities Act. All such shares are \"restricted securities\" as defined by Rule 144 (\"Rule 144\") when issued under available exemptions from registration under the Securities Act, and cannot be resold without registration except in reliance on Rule 144 or another applicable exemption from registration. In general, under Rule 144, our non-affiliates (who have not been affiliates within the past 90 days) can sell restricted shares held for at least six months, subject only to the requirement that we make current information available publicly as required by Rule 144. Our affiliates can sell restricted securities after they have been held for six months, subject to compliance with manner of sale, volume restrictions, Form 144 filing and current public information requirements.\nNo prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of restricted shares of common stock, or the availability of such common stock for sale, will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of such common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the then prevailing market price of the common stock.\nRisk Factors Related to the COVID-10 Pandemic\nAn occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations. The occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These factors, in turn, may not only impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our goods and services but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Also, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "PERMNO": 80413, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "SFEG"}
