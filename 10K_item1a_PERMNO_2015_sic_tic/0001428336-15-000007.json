{"cik": "1428336", "company": "HEALTHEQUITY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks relating to our business and industry\nThe healthcare industry is rapidly evolving and the market for technology-enabled services that empower healthcare consumers is relatively immature and unproven. If we are not successful in promoting the benefits of our platform, our growth may be limited.\nThe market for our products and services is subject to rapid and significant changes. The market for technology-enabled services that empower healthcare consumers is characterized by rapid technological change, new product and service introductions, evolving industry standards, changing customer needs and the entrance of non-traditional competitors. In addition, there may be a limited-time opportunity to achieve and maintain a significant share of this market due in part to the rapidly evolving nature of the healthcare and technology industries and the substantial resources available to our existing and potential competitors. The market for technology-enabled services that empower healthcare consumers is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether this market will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market adoption. In order to remain competitive, we are continually involved in a number of projects to develop new services or compete with these new market entrants, including the development of mobile versions of our proprietary technology platform and our introduction of investment advisory services. These projects carry risks, such as cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems and lack of acceptance by our customers.\nFurthermore, based on our experience with our customers, we believe that many consumers are not familiar with the tax-advantaged benefits of HSAs and other similar tax-advantaged healthcare savings arrangements. Our success depends to a substantial extent on the willingness of consumers to increase their use of technology platforms to manage their healthcare saving and spending, the ability of our platform to increase consumer engagement, and our ability to demonstrate the value of our platform to our existing customers and potential customers. If our existing customers do not recognize or acknowledge the benefits of our platform or our platform does not drive consumer engagement, then the market for our products and services might not develop at all, or it might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we have limited insight into trends that might develop and affect our business. We might make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business, legal and regulatory trends, which could harm our business. If any of these events occur, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFinally, our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to developing new technologies and services, including services that provide improved operating functionality, and adding features to their existing service offerings. If successful, their development efforts could render our services less desirable, resulting in the loss of our existing customers or a reduction in the fees we generate from our products and services.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to data is otherwise obtained, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our customers may reduce the use of, or stop using, our products and services and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur proprietary technology platform enables the exchange of, and access to, sensitive information, and security breaches could result in the loss of this information, theft or loss of actual funds, litigation, indemnity obligations to our customers and other liabilities. While we have security measures in place, if our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error or otherwise, our reputation could be significantly damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur substantial liability. For example, we have in the past experienced security breaches which, although such breaches did not result in any claims against us, could be indicative of the potential for future security breaches. If third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers, we may be required to expend significant resources to resolve these problems. A major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including:\n\u2022\npossible fines, penalties and damages;\n\u2022\nreduced demand for our services;\n\u2022\nan unwillingness of consumers to provide us with their payment information;\n\u2022\nan unwillingness of customers to provide us with personal information; and\n\u2022\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and increase engagement by existing customers, and/or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines, contractual liability and/or other action or liability, thereby harming our operating results.\nCybersecurity breaches could compromise our data and the data of our customers and partners, which may expose us to liability and would likely cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nOur ability to ensure the security of our online platform and thus sensitive customer and partner information is critical to our operations. We rely on standard Internet and other security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, including attacks by hackers and other malfeasance. Any such security breach could compromise our networks and result in the information stored or transmitted there to be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings leading to liability, including under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to our clients, damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, operations and competitive position.\nFraudulent and other illegal activity involving our products and services, including our payment cards, could lead to reputational damage to us and reduce the use and acceptance of our platform.\nCriminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture personal account information in order to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and identity theft. We rely upon third parties for some transaction processing services, which subjects us to risks related to the vulnerabilities of those third parties. For example, we were exposed to risks relating to the 2013 theft of payment card numbers housed in Target Corporation\u2019s point of sale system when certain of our members used our payment cards at Target Corporation and those cards were compromised. Under our agreement with our payment card processing network, we are required to make our customers whole for losses sustained when using our payment cards, even in instances where we are not directly responsible for the underlying cause of such loss. A single significant incident of fraud, or increases in the overall level of fraud, involving our payment cards, our custodial accounts or our reimbursement administration services, could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services, cause our customers to cease doing business with us or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively against our current and future competitors.\nThe market for our products and services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented. We view our competition in terms of direct and indirect competitors. Our direct competitors are HSA custodians that include state or federally chartered banks, such as Webster Bank, Optum Bank, and Wells Fargo Bank, and non-bank custodians approved by the U.S. Treasury as meeting certain ownership, capitalization, expertise and governance requirements, such as Payflex Systems USA, Inc. This market is highly fragmented and characterized by more than 2,200 HSA custodians. We also have numerous indirect competitors, including benefits administration technology and service providers that work with other HSA custodians to sell into health plans and/or employer channels.\nMany of our competitors, in particular commercial banks and financial institutions, have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. As a result, some of these competitors may be in a position to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services and have offered, or may in the future offer, a wider range of products and services that may be more attractive to potential customers, and they may also use advertising and marketing strategies that achieve broader brand recognition or acceptance. For example, our competitors that are commercial banks and financial institutions may leverage their ability to generate revenue from other banking activities and decide to offer no-fee HSAs, which may permit them to increase market share in our market. Furthermore, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive\nlandscape could materially adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future Network Partners or other strategic partners, thereby limiting our ability to promote our solution with these parties. Our Health Plan Partners may also decide to offer HSAs directly, which would significantly reduce our channel partner opportunities.\nIn addition, well-known retail mutual fund companies, such as Fidelity and Vanguard, who currently do not have a strong presence or have somewhat limited products in the market for technology-enabled services that empower healthcare consumers may in the future decide to expand their products or attempt to grow their presence in the market. These investment companies have significant advantages over us in terms of brand name recognition, years of experience managing tax-advantaged retirement accounts (e.g., 401(k) and IRA), highly developed recordkeeping, trust functions, and fund advisory and customer relations management, among others. If we are unable to compete effectively with new competitors, our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from healthcare-related saving and spending by consumers, which could be affected by changes affecting the broader healthcare industry, including decreased spending in the industry overall. General reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things:\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare industry participants interact with consumers and the general public;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of healthcare industry participants;\n\u2022\nreductions in governmental funding for healthcare; and\n\u2022\nadverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare industry participants.\nEven if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market segments that we serve now or in the future. The healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years, and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. However, the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the demand for our products and services will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in the healthcare industry.\nThe healthcare regulatory and political framework is uncertain and evolving.\nHealthcare laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and may change significantly in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the PPACA, a health care reform measure which provides healthcare insurance for approximately 30 million more Americans. The PPACA includes a variety of healthcare reform provisions and requirements that will become effective at varying times through 2018, it substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and may significantly impact our industry. Many of the provisions of the PPACA will phase in over the course of the next several years, and we may be unable to predict accurately what effect the PPACA or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future will have on our business.\nChanges in applicable federal and state laws relating to the tax benefits available through tax-advantaged healthcare accounts such as HSAs would materially adversely affect our business.\nThe efforts of governmental and third-party payers to raise revenue or contain or reduce the costs of healthcare may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the U.S. healthcare system, which could include restructuring the tax benefits available through HSAs, FSAs, and similar tax-advantaged healthcare accounts. For example, states may seek to raise revenues by enacting tax laws that eliminate the tax deductions available to individuals who contribute to HSAs. Our business is substantially dependent on the tax benefits available through HSAs. If the laws or regulations are changed to limit or eliminate the tax benefits available through these accounts, such a change would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to criminal or civil sanctions if we fail to comply with privacy regulations regarding the access, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, including HIPAA.\nNumerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, access and use of personally identifiable information, including HIPAA, which governs the treatment of protected health information, a\nspecific type of personally identifiable information. In the provision of services to our customers, we and our third-party vendors may collect, access, use, maintain and transmit protected health information in ways that are subject to many of these laws and regulations.\nHIPAA applies to covered entities (e.g., health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and most providers). HIPAA also applies to \u201cbusiness associates\u201d of covered entities, which include individuals and entities that provide services for or on behalf of covered entities pursuant to which the service provider may access protected health information. We are a business associate to our Health Plan Partners and to those other covered entities to which we provide services that involve our receipt, access, and/or creation of protected health information. On January 17, 2013, the United States Department of Health and Human Services issued a final rule to implement modifications to HIPAA, such as business associate compliance, determination and reporting of security breaches, and penalties, as well as modifications as required in the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. The final rule also revises the standard used to determine when entities are required to report security breaches and also makes covered entities liable for the acts of their business associates and business associates liable for the acts of their subcontractors, who are now also deemed business associates, in accordance with the federal common law of agency. If we or any of our subcontractors experience a breach of patient information, the expanded liability for business associates could result in substantial financial and reputational harm.\nThe two rules that were promulgated pursuant to HIPAA that could most significantly affect our business are: (i) the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, or the Privacy Rule, and (ii) the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, or the Security Rule. The Privacy Rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information, and requires entities to safeguard that information and to provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information. The Security Rule establishes elaborate requirements for safeguarding patient health information transmitted or stored electronically. The Privacy Rule and the Security Rule require the development and implementation of detailed policies, procedures, contracts and forms to assure compliance. We have implemented such compliance measures, but we may be required to make additional costly system purchases and modifications to comply with evolving HIPAA rules and to perform periodic audits and refinements as required by HIPAA.\nOther federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy and security of protected health information and/or personally identifiable information also apply to us directly by law or indirectly through contractual obligations to our members that are directly subject to the laws. If we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protected health information and personally identifiable information, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions.\nWe are subject to various privacy related regulations promulgated under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which may include increased cost of compliance.\nWe are subject to various laws, rules and regulations related to privacy, information security and data protection promulgated under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and we could be negatively impacted by these laws, rules and regulations. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act guidelines require, among other things, that we develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. Our management believes that we are currently operating in compliance with these regulations. However, continued compliance with these laws, rules and regulations regarding the privacy, security and protection of our customers\u2019 data, or the implementation of any additional privacy rules and regulations, could result in higher compliance and technology costs for us.\nChanges in laws and regulations relating to interchange fees on payment card transactions would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nAt both the federal and state level, there are recent changes and proposed changes to existing laws and regulations that would limit the fees or interchange rates that can be charged on payment card transactions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act known as the Durbin Amendment gave the Federal Reserve Board, or the FRB, the power to regulate payment card interchange fees. On June 29, 2011, the FRB issued its final rule that set a cap, which took effect on October 1, 2011, on the interchange fee an issuer can receive from a single payment card transaction. Our HSA-linked payment cards are exempt from the rule. However, to the extent that our other payment cards or issuing banks lose their exempt status, the interchange rates applicable to transactions involving our payment cards or issuing banks could be impacted, which would decrease our revenue and profit and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investment advisory services are subject to complex regulation, and any compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.\nOur subsidiary HealthEquity Advisors, LLC is a registered investment advisor that provides web-only investment advisory services. As such, it must comply with the requirements of the Advisers Act and related SEC regulations. Such requirements relate to, among other things, disclosure obligations, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, marketing restrictions and general anti-fraud prohibitions. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser\u2019s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Compliance with any new regulatory requirements may divert internal resources and take significant time and effort. Any claim of non-compliance, regardless of merit or ultimate outcome, could subject us to investigation by the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. This in turn could result in additional claims or class action litigation brought on behalf of our clients, any of which could result in substantial cost to us and divert management\u2019s attention and other resources away from our operations. Furthermore, investor perceptions of us may suffer, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Our compliance processes may not be sufficient to prevent assertions that we failed to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation.\nOur distribution model relies on the cooperation of our Network Partners. If our Network Partners choose to partner with other providers of technology-enabled services that empower healthcare consumers, including HSA services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our Network Partners\u2019 willingness to partner with us to offer their customers and/or employees our products and services. Certain of our Health Plan Partners enjoy significant market share in various geographic regions. If these Health Plan Partners choose to partner with our competitors, our results of operations, business and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nDeclining levels of interest rates may reduce our ability to generate income on our cash AUM and to attract deposits into HSAs, which would adversely affect our profitability.\nAs a non-bank custodian, we must partner with our FDIC-insured custodial depository bank partners to hold and invest our cash AUM. We generate a significant portion of our consolidated revenue from fees we earn from our FDIC-insured custodial depository bank partners. For example, during the years ended January 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we generated approximately 28%, 31% and 33%, respectively, of our total revenue from custodial fees. A decline in prevailing interest rates may negatively affect our business by reducing the yield we realize on our cash AUM. In addition, if we do not offer our HSA Members competitive interest rates, our members may choose not to deposit their HSA cash balances with us. Any such scenario could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our customers do not continue to utilize our payment cards, our results of operations, business and prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nWe derived 20%, 19% and 18% of our total revenue during the years ended January 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from fees that are paid to us when our customers utilize our payment cards. These fees represent a percentage of the expenses transacted on each card. If our customers do not use these payment cards at the rate we expect, if they elect to withdraw funds using a non-revenue generating mechanism such as direct reimbursement, or if other alternatives to these payment cards develop, our results of operations, business and prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on a single bank identification number sponsor for our payment cards, and a change in relationship with this sponsor or its failure to comply with certain banking regulations could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on a single bank identification number, or BIN, sponsor in relation to the payment cards we issue. A BIN sponsor is a bank or credit union that provides the BIN that allows a prepaid card program to run on one of the major card brand networks (e.g., VISA, MasterCard, Discover or American Express). Our BIN sponsor enables us to link the payment cards that we offer our members to the VISA network, thereby allowing our members to use our payment cards to pay for healthcare-related expenses with a \u201cswipe\u201d of the card. If any material adverse event were to affect our BIN sponsor, including a significant decline in its financial condition, a decline in the quality of its service, its inability to comply with applicable banking and financial service regulatory requirements, systems failure or its inability to pay us fees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because we may be forced to reduce the availability of, or eliminate entirely, our payment card offering. In addition, we do not have a long-term contract with our BIN sponsor, and it may increase the fees it charges us or terminate its relationship with us. If we were required to change BIN sponsors, we could not\naccurately predict the success of such change or that the terms of our agreement with a new BIN sponsor would be as favorable to us, especially in light of the recent increased regulatory scrutiny of the payment card industry, which has rendered the market for BIN sponsor services less competitive.\nOn June 10, 2014, our BIN sponsor disclosed that it had entered into a consent order with the FDIC relating to its obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Under the order, the BIN sponsor agreed to, among other things, certain restrictions on its prepaid card program and other programs. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not believe this order restricts the BIN sponsor from continuing its business with us. However, we cannot assure you that the order will not have any impact on our business, either directly or indirectly, by affecting the BIN sponsor\u2019s desire to continue to conduct such business or the terms thereof. Should the FDIC-imposed consent order reduce or eliminate our BIN sponsor\u2019s willingness to conduct business with us, negatively impact the terms of our agreement with our BIN sponsor, or reduce the financial viability of our BIN sponsor, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected for the reasons discussed above.\nWe rely on our FDIC-insured custodial depository bank partners for certain custodial account services from which we generate fees. A business failure in any FDIC-insured custodial depository bank partner would materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs a non-bank custodian, we rely on our seven FDIC-insured custodial bank partners to hold and invest our cash AUM. If any material adverse event were to affect one of our FDIC-insured custodial depository bank partners, including a significant decline in its financial condition, a decline in the quality of its service, loss of deposits, its inability to comply with applicable banking and financial services regulatory requirements, systems failure or its inability to pay us fees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we were required to change custodial depository banking partners, we could not accurately predict the success of such change or that the terms of our agreement with a new banking partner would be as favorable to us as our current agreements, especially in light of the recent consolidation in the banking industry, which has rendered the market for FDIC-insured retail banking services less competitive.\nWe receive important services from third-party vendors. Replacing them would be difficult and disruptive to our business.\nWe have entered into contracts with third-party vendors to provide critical services relating to our business, including fraud management and other customer verification services, transaction processing and settlement, and card production. For example, we rely on a third-party vendor to process transactions involving our payment cards. Accordingly, we depend, in part, on the services, technology and software of this vendor and other third-party service providers. In the event that these service providers fail to maintain adequate levels of support, do not provide high quality service, increase the fees they charge us, discontinue their lines of business, terminate our contractual arrangements or cease or reduce operations, we may suffer additional costs and be required to pursue new third-party relationships, which could materially disrupt our operations and our ability to provide our products and services, and could divert management\u2019s time and resources. It would be difficult to replace some of our third-party vendors, such as our payment card transaction processor, in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future, and our business and operations could be adversely affected. If we are unable to complete a transition to a new provider on a timely basis, or at all, we could be forced to temporarily or permanently discontinue certain services, which could disrupt services to our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be unable to establish comparable new third-party relationships on as favorable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on software licensed from third parties that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors or failures of our online platform that could lead to lost customers or harm to our reputation.\nWe rely on certain cloud-based software licensed from third parties to run our business. For example, we utilize Oracle Corporation\u2019s RightNow cloud solution to manage our customer relations. This software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms and any loss of the right to use any of this software could result in delays in the provisioning of our products and services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. In addition, we have certain service level agreements with our customers for which the availability of this software is critical. Any decrease in the availability of our service as a result of errors, defects, a disruption or failure of our licensed software may require us to provide significant fee credits or refunds to our customers. Our software licensed from third parties is also subject to change or upgrade, which may result in our incurring significant costs to implement such changes or upgrades.\nWe must adequately protect our brand and the intellectual property rights related to our products and services and avoid infringing on the proprietary rights of others.\nWe believe that the HealthEquity brand is critical to the success of our business, and we utilize trademark registration and other means to protect it. Our business would be harmed if we were unable to protect our brand against infringement and its value was to decrease as a result.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements to protect the intellectual property rights related to our products and services. We may unknowingly violate the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others and, thus, may be subject to claims by third parties. If so, we may be required to devote significant time and resources to defending against these claims or to protecting and enforcing our own rights. Some of our intellectual property rights may not be protected by intellectual property laws, particularly in foreign jurisdictions. The loss of our intellectual property or the inability to secure or enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend successfully against an infringement action could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we fail to develop widespread brand awareness cost-effectively, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and attracting new customers and strategic partners. Brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses, we may fail to attract or retain a sufficient number of customers and strategic partners necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our products and services.\nWe have in the past completed acquisitions and may acquire or invest in other companies or technologies in the future, which could divert management\u2019s attention, fail to meet our expectations, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe have in the past acquired, and we may in the future acquire or invest in, businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products and services, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated benefits of these or any future acquisitions. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses related to identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nThere are inherent risks in integrating and managing acquisitions. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to assimilate or integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition, and our management may be distracted from operating our business. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\nincurrence of acquisition-related costs, which would be recognized as a current period expense;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;\n\u2022\nthe inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our platform and of maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our brand;\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate or implement additional controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nharm to our existing business relationships with customers and strategic partners as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s time and resources from our core business;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business and diversion of management and employee resources;\n\u2022\nour ability to coordinate organizations that are geographically diverse and that have different business cultures;\n\u2022\nour inability to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe inability to recognize acquired revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies; and\n\u2022\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash or the incurrence of debt to consummate the acquisition.\nAcquisitions also increase the risk of unforeseen legal liability, including for potential violations of applicable law or industry rules and regulations, arising from prior or ongoing acts or omissions by the acquired businesses which are not discovered by due diligence during the acquisition process. Generally, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Even if we are successful in completing and integrating an acquired business, the acquired businesses may not perform as we expect or enhance the value of our business as a whole.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.\nOur quarterly operating results, including our revenue, gross profit, net income and cash flows, may vary significantly in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline rapidly, may lead analysts to change their long-term models for valuing our common stock, could cause short-term liquidity issues, may impact our ability to retain or attract key personnel or cause other unanticipated issues. If our quarterly operating results or guidance fall below the expectations of research analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Our quarterly operating expenses and operating results may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets. We may need to record write-downs from future impairments of identified intangible assets and goodwill, which could adversely affect our costs and business operations.\nOur consolidated balance sheet includes significant intangible assets, including approximately $4.7 million in goodwill and $26.5 million in intangible assets, together representing approximately 20% of our total assets as of January 31, 2015. The determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments. We test our goodwill for impairment each fiscal year, but we also test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at any time when there is a change in circumstances that indicates that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired. Any future determination that these assets are carried at greater than their fair value could result in substantial non-cash impairment charges, which could significantly impact our reported operating results.\nIf we are unable to meet or exceed the net worth test required by the IRS, we could be unable to maintain our non-bank custodian status, which would have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate our business.\nAs a non-bank custodian, we are required to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.408-2(e), or the Treasury Regulations, including the net worth requirements set forth therein. If we should fail to comply with the Treasury Regulations\u2019 non-bank custodian requirements, including the net worth requirements, we could be unable to accept new custodial assets or be unable to rely on our previously granted IRS Notice of Approval to serve as a non-bank custodian, which would have a material adverse impact on our business operations. Net worth is defined for this purpose as the amount of our assets less the amount of our liabilities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. If we fail to comply with the Treasury Regulations, including the net worth requirements, such failure would materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain our current custodial accounts and grow by adding additional custodial accounts, and it could result in the institution of procedures for the revocation of our authorization to operate as a non-bank custodian.\nFailure to manage future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continued rapid expansion and development of our business may place a significant strain upon our management and administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. As of January 31, 2015, we had approximately 1.4 million HSA Members and $2.4 billion in AUM representing growth of 47% and 45%, respectively,\nfrom January 31, 2014. For the year ended January 31, 2015, our total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were approximately $87.9 million and $25.2 million, respectively, which represents year over year annual growth rates of approximately 42% and 60%, respectively. See \u201cKey financial and operating metrics\u201d for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA. While to date we believe we have effectively managed the effect on our operations resulting from the rapid growth of our business, our growth strategy contemplates further increasing the number of our HSA Members and our AUM at relatively higher growth rates than industry averages. However, the rate at which we have been able to attract new HSA Members in the past may not be indicative of the rate at which we will be able to attract additional HSA Members in the future.\nOur success depends in part upon the ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively. Our ability to grow also depends upon our ability to successfully hire, train, supervise, and manage new employees, obtain financing for our capital needs, expand our systems effectively, control increasing costs, allocate our human resources optimally, maintain clear lines of communication between our operational functions and our finance and accounting functions, and manage the pressures on our management and administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we will face as we continue to expand our operations or that we will be able to manage growth effectively or to achieve further growth at all. If our business does not continue to grow or if we fail to effectively manage any future growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe must be able to operate and scale our technology effectively to match our business growth.\nOur ability to continue to provide our products and services to a growing number of customers, as well as to enhance our existing products and services, attract new customers and strategic partners, and offer new products and services, is dependent on our information technology systems. If we are unable to manage the technology associated with our business effectively, we could experience increased costs, reductions in system availability and customer loss. We are currently investing in significant upgrading of the capacity and performance of our proprietary technology platform and database design to ensure continued performance at scale, to reduce spending on maintenance activities, and to enable us to execute technology innovation more quickly. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these upgrades to our platform, we may be unable to adequately meet the needs of our customers and/or implement technology-based innovation in response to a rapidly changing market, which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe plan to extend and expand our products and services and introduce new products and services, and we may not accurately estimate the impact of developing, introducing and updating these products and services on our business.\nWe intend to continue to invest in technology and development to create new and enhanced products and services to offer our customers, and to enhance our platform\u2019s compatibilities. We may not be able to anticipate or manage new risks and obligations or legal, compliance or other requirements that may arise in these areas. The anticipated benefits of such new and improved products and services may not outweigh the costs and resources associated with their development. Some new services may be received negatively by our existing and/or potential customers and strategic partners and have to be put on hold or cancelled entirely.\nOur ability to attract and retain new customer revenue from existing customers will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing products and services and to introduce new products and services. The success of any enhancement or new product or service depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancement or new product or service. Any new product or service we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new products or services or enhance our existing products or services to meet member or network partner requirements, our results of operations, financial condition, business or prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nDeveloping and implementing new and updated applications, features and services for our technology platform may be more difficult than expected, may take longer and cost more than expected and may not result in sufficient increases in revenue to justify the costs.\nAttracting and retaining new customers requires us to continue to improve the technology underlying our proprietary technology platform. Accordingly, we must continue to develop new and updated applications, features and services. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or if we are unable to implement new applications, features and services that enhance our customers\u2019 experience without disruption to our existing ones, we may lose potential and\nexisting customers. We rely on a combination of internal development, strategic relationships, licensing and acquisitions to develop our content offerings and healthcare saving and spending services. These efforts may:\n\u2022\ncost more than expected;\n\u2022\ntake longer than originally expected;\n\u2022\nrequire more testing than originally anticipated;\n\u2022\nrequire additional advertising and marketing costs; and\n\u2022\nrequire the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources.\nThe revenue opportunities generated from these efforts may fail to justify the amounts spent.\nAny failure to offer high-quality customer support services could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and strategic partners and our operating results.\nOur customers depend on our support and customer education organizations to educate them about, and resolve technical issues relating to, our products and services. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for education and support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without a corresponding increase in revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our products and services and business and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality education and technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality education support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our products and services to existing and prospective customers and our business and operating results. We promote 24/7/365 education and support along with our proprietary technology platform. Interruptions or delays that inhibit our ability to meet that standard may hurt our reputation or ability to attract and retain customers.\nWe rely on our management team and key employees and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our founder and senior management team and other key personnel. While we have entered into offer letters or employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, all of our employees are \u201cat-will\u201d employees, and their employment can be terminated by us or them at any time, for any reason and without notice, subject, in certain cases, to severance payment rights. In order to retain valuable employees, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we provide stock options that vest over time or based on performance. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time or based on performance will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract offers from other organizations. The departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our business, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to employ a suitable replacement for the departing individual, or that a replacement could be hired on terms that are favorable to us. Volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may affect our ability to attract replacements should key personnel depart.\nOur success also depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate additional skilled management personnel. Although we have not historically experienced unique difficulties attracting qualified employees, we could experience such problems in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in our field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry. In addition, we have experienced employee turnover and expect to continue to experience employee turnover in the future. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If our retention efforts are not successful or our employee turnover rate increases in the future, our business will be harmed.\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success has been our corporate culture. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. As we continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nWe might require additional capital to support our business in the future, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf our cash and cash equivalents balances and any cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our future cash requirements, we will need to access additional capital to fund our operations. We may also need to raise additional capital to maintain compliance with the Treasury Regulations including the net worth requirements set forth therein or to take advantage of new business or acquisition opportunities. We may seek to raise capital by, among other things:\n\u2022\nissuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities;\n\u2022\nissuing debt securities; or\n\u2022\nborrowing funds under a credit facility.\nWe may not be able to raise needed cash on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us or at all. Financings, if available, may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the holders of new securities may also receive rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. In addition, if we were to raise cash through a debt financing, the terms of the financing might impose additional conditions or restrictions on our operations that could adversely affect our business. If we require new sources of financing but they are insufficient or unavailable, we would be required to modify our operating plans to take into account the limitations of available funding, which would harm our ability to maintain or grow our business.\nOur ability to limit our liabilities by contract or through insurance may be ineffective or insufficient to cover our future liabilities.\nWe attempt to limit, by contract, our liability for damages arising from our negligence, errors, mistakes or security breaches. Contractual limitations on liability, however, may not be enforceable or may otherwise not provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages. We maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions. It is possible, however, that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations. In addition, negative publicity caused by these events may delay market acceptance of our products and services, any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our business.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and efforts to protect them may be costly and may substantially harm our business.\nOur future success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We have largely relied, and expect to continue to rely, on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, as well as generally relying on confidentiality procedures and agreements with our employees, consultants, customers and vendors, to control access to, and distribution of, technology, software, documentation and other confidential information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain, use or distribute our technology without authorization. If this were to occur, we could lose revenue as a result of competition from products infringing or misappropriating our technology and intellectual property and we may be required to initiate litigation to protect our proprietary rights and market position. U.S. copyright, trademark and trade secret laws offer us only limited protection and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent. Accordingly, defense of our trademarks and proprietary technology may become an increasingly important issue as we continue to expand our operations.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our trademarks and technology is difficult and the steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of the trademarks or technology on which we rely. If competitors are able to use our trademarks or technology without recourse, our ability to compete would be harmed and our business would be materially and adversely affected. We may elect to initiate litigation in the future to enforce or protect our proprietary rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. That litigation may not ultimately be successful and could result in substantial costs to us, the reduction or loss in intellectual property protection for our technology, the diversion of our management\u2019s attention and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nConfidentiality arrangements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe have devoted substantial resources to the development of our technology, business operations and business plans. In order to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, we rely in significant part on confidentiality arrangements with our employees, independent contractors, advisers and customers. These arrangements may not be effective to prevent disclosure of confidential information, including trade secrets, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we would not be able to assert trade secret rights against such parties. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products and services by copying functionality. In addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and other intellectual property laws may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website and advertising and marketing activities.\nTrademark, copyright and other intellectual property rights are important to us and our business. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technologies, applications and the content on our website. We also rely on intellectual property licensed from third parties. From time to time, third parties may allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are forced to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, regardless of the merit or ultimate result of such claims, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, limitations on our ability to use our website or inability to market or provide our products and services. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to:\n\u2022\ndevelop non-infringing technology;\n\u2022\npay damages;\n\u2022\nenter into royalty or licensing agreements;\n\u2022\ncease providing certain products or services; or\n\u2022\ntake other actions to resolve the claims.\nIf we cannot protect our domain name, our ability to successfully promote our brand will be impaired.\nWe currently own the web domain name www.healthequity.com, which is critical to the operation of our business. The acquisition and maintenance of domain names, or Internet addresses, is generally regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. The regulation of domain names in the U.S. and in foreign countries is subject to change. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names in all countries in which we conduct business. Furthermore, it is unclear whether laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights will be extended to protect domain names. Therefore, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy of establishing a strong brand for HealthEquity if we cannot prevent others from using similar domain names or trademarks. This failure could impair our ability to increase our market share and revenue.\nIf one or more jurisdictions successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect additional sales and use taxes on our fees, we could be subject to additional liability with respect to past or future sales and the results of our operations could be adversely affected.\nWe do not collect sales and use taxes in all jurisdictions in which our customers are located, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Sales and use tax laws and rates vary by jurisdiction and such laws are subject to interpretation. In those jurisdictions and in those cases where we do believe sales taxes are applicable, we collect and file timely sales tax returns. Currently, such taxes are minimal. Jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales and use taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in the assessment of such taxes, interest and penalties, and we could be required to collect such taxes in the future. This additional sales and use tax liability could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nOur online platform is hosted from two data centers. Any disruption of service at our facilities or our third-party hosting providers could interrupt or delay our customers\u2019 access to our products and services, which could harm our operating results.\nThe ability of our employees, members, Health Plan Partners and Employer Partners to access our technology platform is critical to our business. We currently serve our customers from data centers located in Draper, Utah, with a backup site in Austin, Texas. We cannot ensure that the measures we have taken will be effective to prevent or minimize interruptions to our operations. Our facilities are vulnerable to interruption or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nextended power loss;\n\u2022\ntelecommunications failures from multiple telecommunications providers;\n\u2022\nnatural disaster or an act of terrorism;\n\u2022\nsoftware and hardware errors, or failures in our own systems or in other systems;\n\u2022\nnetwork environment disruptions such as computer viruses, hacking and similar problems in our own systems and in other systems;\n\u2022\ntheft and vandalism of equipment; and\n\u2022\nactions or events caused by or related to third parties.\nWe attempt to mitigate these risks through various business continuity efforts, including redundant infrastructure, 24/7/365 system activity monitoring, backup and recovery procedures, use of a secure storage facility for backup media, separate test systems and change management and system security measures, but our precautions may not protect against all potential problems. Our data recovery center is equipped with physical space, power, storage and networking infrastructure and Internet connectivity to support our online platform in the event of the interruption of services at our primary data center. Even with this data recovery center, however, our operations would be interrupted during the transition process should our primary data center experience a failure. Disruptions at our data centers could cause disruptions to our online platform and data loss or corruption. We have experienced interruptions and delays in service and availability for data centers, bandwidth and other technologies in the past. Any future errors, failure, interruptions or delays experienced in connection these third-party technologies could delay our customers\u2019 access to our products, which would harm our business. This could damage our reputation, subject us to potential liability or costs related to defending against claims or cause our customers and strategic partners to cease doing business with us, any of which could negatively impact our revenue.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively deliver our products and services, which could cause us to lose customers and harm our operating results.\nOur business depends on the continuing operation of our technology infrastructure and systems. Any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our ability to deliver our products and services. Interruptions in our service could reduce our revenue and profits, and our reputation could be damaged if people believe our systems are unreliable. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, break-ins, hardware or software failures, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems and similar events.\nAny unscheduled interruption in our service would result in an immediate loss of revenue. Frequent or persistent system failures that result in the unavailability of our platform or slower response times could reduce our customers\u2019 ability to access our platform, impair our delivery of our products and services and harm the perception of our platform as reliable, trustworthy and consistent. Our insurance policies provide only limited coverage for service interruptions and may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems.\nActs of terrorism, acts of war and other unforeseen events may cause damage or disruption to us or our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nNatural disasters, acts of war, terrorist attacks and the escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or otherwise may have negative and significant effects, such as imposition of increased security measures, changes in applicable laws, market disruptions and job losses. Such events may have an adverse effect on the economy in\ngeneral. Moreover, the potential for future terrorist attacks and the national and international responses to such threats could affect the business in ways that cannot be predicted. The effect of any of these events or threats could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks relating to owning our common stock\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Sarbanes-Oxley, requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and, beginning with our second annual report following our initial public offering, which will be for our year ending January 31, 2016, provide a management report on internal controls over financial reporting. Sarbanes-Oxley also requires that our management report on internal controls over financial reporting be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm, to the extent we are no longer an emerging growth company. We do not expect to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to our management report on internal controls over financial reporting for so long as we are an emerging growth company.\nIn connection with our preparation for our initial public offering, we concluded that there was a material weakness in our financial reporting that caused the restatement of our previously issued financial statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2013. The material weakness we identified comprised our lack of sufficient expertise to appropriately address and timely account for complex, non-routine transactions in accordance with GAAP. The evidence of this material weakness related primarily to the measurement and classification of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants issued in connection with our redeemable convertible preferred stock. During the year ended January 31, 2014, we added personnel to our accounting staff with appropriate levels of experience to remediate the aforementioned material weakness and further developed our accounting policies and financial reporting procedures. As of January 31, 2015, we determined that the material weakness had been remediated as a result of the action taken and the resulting improvements in our internal controls.\nIf we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe stock market in general has been highly volatile. As a result, the market price and trading volume for our common stock may also be highly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly include:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nconditions that impact demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, financial guidance and other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities or research analysts who track our common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in government and other regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\narrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us, our investors or members of our management team; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, telecommunications failure, cyber attack, civil unrest in various parts of the world, acts of war, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events.\nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume and market price of our common stock and may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares of our common stock. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders often file securities class-action lawsuits against such company. Our involvement in a class-action lawsuit could divert our senior management\u2019s attention and, if adversely determined, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nAs of March 10, 2015, we had 55,065,470 shares of our common stock outstanding, of which 22,082,920 shares are held by our affiliates and subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. In addition, as of March 10, 2015, we had options outstanding that, if fully exercised, would results in the issuance of approximately 6,189,150 shares of our common stock. All of the shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of options have been registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements.\nHolders of approximately 22,562,903 shares, or 41.0%, of our outstanding common stock have registration rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders in the future.\nOur principal stockholder owns a significant percentage of our shares and will be able to exert\nsignificant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of March 10, 2015, our principal stockholder, Berkley Capital Investors, L.P., or Berkley, owned approximately 28.0% of our outstanding voting shares. Therefore, Berkley may have the ability to influence us through its ownership position. Berkley may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, it may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common shares that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. In addition, certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors. The absence of cumulative voting makes it more difficult for a minority stockholder to gain a seat on our board of directors to influence our board\u2019s decision regarding a takeover.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the securities or industry analysts that covers us downgrades our shares or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our shares could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain whether taking advantage of certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company until January 31, 2020, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if, among other things, the market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nIf some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any decisions to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, Sarbanes-Oxley, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations. Sarbanes-Oxley requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new\nguidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nBeing a public company and these new rules and regulations have made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and in the future we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in our filings with the SEC, our business and financial condition have become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have no current plans to declare and pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities, which may rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we decide to issue debt securities in the future, which would rank senior to shares of our common stock, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their share holdings in us.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us difficult, even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. These provisions include the inability of our stockholders to act by written consent and certain advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and nominations for candidates for the election of directors. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Accordingly, our board of directors could rely upon these or other provisions in our governing documents and Delaware law to prevent or delay a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors and officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 14803, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "HQY"}
