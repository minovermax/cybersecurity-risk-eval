{"cik": "1382219", "company": "6D Global Technologies, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-07-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. - Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of 6D Global can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to our Digital Marketing Business (Content Management Systems)\nWe rely on the availability of licenses to third-party software and other licensed intellectual property.\nMany of our products and services utilize software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, and we otherwise use software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business. This exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control. For example, a licensor may have difficulties keeping up with technological changes or may stop supporting the software or other intellectual property that it licenses to us or our clients. Also, it will be necessary in the future to renew licenses, expand the scope of existing licenses, or seek new licenses relating to various aspects of these products and services or otherwise relating to our business, which may result in increased license fees. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights, or to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, if at all, and integrated into our products and services or otherwise in the conduct of our business. Moreover, the inclusion in our products and services of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis may limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur future performance depends in part on support from independent software vendors, system integrators and other third-party software developers.\nWe depend on independent software vendors, system integrators and other third-party software vendors to create applications that will integrate with our own products and services. This presents certain risks to our business, including that:\n\u00b7\nwe cannot provide any assurance that these applications meet the same quality standards that we apply to our own development efforts, and to the extent they contain bugs or defects, they may create disruptions in our customers\u2019 use of our software or negatively affect our brand;\n\u00b7\nthese independent software vendors, system integrators and third-party software developers may not possess the appropriate intellectual property rights to develop and share their applications; and\n\u00b7\nsome of these independent software vendors, system integrators and third-party software developers may use the insight they gain from using our software and from documentation publicly available to develop competing products or product features.\nMany of these risks are not within our control to prevent, and our brand may be damaged if these applications do not perform to our customers\u2019 satisfaction and that dissatisfaction is attributed to us.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on our ability to develop solutions and service offerings that keep pace with the changes in the markets in which we provide our services.\nThe professional services markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions and service offerings that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we provide services. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies in a timely or cost-effective manner or, if these services are developed, that we will be successful in offering and deploying them in the marketplace. In addition, we cannot be sure that products, services or technologies developed by others will not render our services non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address the demands of the rapidly evolving technological environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement, in a timely and cost-effective manner, solutions for clients that both leverage their legacy systems and appropriately utilize newer technologies. Our ability to implement solutions for our clients incorporating new developments and improvements in technology which translate into productivity improvements for our clients and to develop service offerings that meet current and prospective clients\u2019 needs are critical to our success.\nIf we do not attract and retain qualified professional staff, we may be unable to adequately perform our client engagements and could be limited in accepting new client engagements.\nOur business is labor intensive, and our success depends upon our ability to attract, retain, train and motivate highly skilled employees. The improvement in demand for marketing and business and technology consulting services has further increased the need for employees with specialized skills or significant experience in marketing, business and technology consulting, particularly at senior levels. We are expanding our operations, and these expansion efforts will be highly dependent on attracting a sufficient number of highly skilled people. We may not be successful in attracting enough employees to achieve our expansion or staffing plans. Furthermore, the industry turnover rates for these types of employees are high, and we may not be successful in retaining, training and motivating the employees we attract. Any inability to attract, retain, train and motivate employees could impair our ability to manage adequately and complete existing assignments and to bid for or accept new client engagements. Such inability may also force us to increase our hiring of expensive independent contractors, which may increase our costs and reduce our profitability on client engagements. We must also devote substantial managerial and financial resources to monitoring and managing our workforce and other resources. Our future success will depend on our ability to manage the levels and related costs of our workforce and other resources effectively.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted by economic conditions and related fluctuations in client demand for marketing, business, technology and other consulting services.\nThe market for our consulting services and the technologies used in our solutions is prone to fluctuation with economic cycles - particularly in the United States, where we earn the majority of our revenues. During economic cycles in which companies experience financial difficulties or uncertainty, clients and potential clients may cancel or delay spending on marketing, technology and other business initiatives, which could result in reduced demand for our services, assignment cancellations or delays, lower revenues and operating margins resulting from price reduction pressures for our services, and payment and collection issues with our clients. Our efforts to down-size in a manner intended to mirror downturned economic conditions, could be delayed and costly, and could also result in us having inadequate people resources as economic conditions improve. Any of these events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability will be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain our pricing and utilization rates as well as control our costs.\nOur profitability derives from and is impacted by three primary factors: (i) the prices for our services; (ii) our professionals\u2019 utilization or billable time; and (iii) our costs. To achieve our desired level of profitability, our utilization must remain at an appropriate rate, and we must contain our costs. Should we reduce our prices in the future as a result of pricing pressures, or should we be unable to achieve our target utilization rates and costs, our profitability could be adversely impacted.\nOur services may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, and create a liability for us as well as harm our reputation and client relationships.\nThe services that we offer to clients may infringe the intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) rights of third parties and result in legal claims against our clients and us. These claims may damage our reputation, adversely impact our client relationships and create substantial liability for us. Moreover, we generally agree in our client contracts to indemnify the clients for expenses or liabilities they incur as a result of third party IP infringement claims associated with our services, and the resolution of these claims, irrespective of whether a court determines that our services infringed another party\u2019s IP rights, may be time-consuming, disruptive to our business and extraordinarily costly. Finally, in connection with an IP infringement dispute, we may be required to cease using or developing certain IP that we offer to our clients. These circumstances could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue as well as require us to incur significant expense to develop alternative or modified services for our clients\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary methodology.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary methodology. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, nondisclosures and other contractual arrangements. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors, vendors and clients, and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information.\nWe are dependent on, and may be adversely impacted by, the performance of third parties on certain complex engagements.\nCertain complex engagements may require that we partner with specialized software or systems vendors or other partners to perform services. Often in these circumstances, we are liable to our clients for the performance of these third parties. Should the third parties fail to perform timely or satisfactorily, our clients may elect to terminate the engagements or withhold payment until the services have been completed successfully. Additionally, the timing of our revenue recognition may be affected or we may realize lower profits if we incur additional costs due to delays or because we must assign additional personnel to complete the engagement. Furthermore, our relationships with our clients and our reputation generally may suffer harm as a result of these third parties\u2019 unsatisfactory performance.\nWe may be liable to our clients for substantial damages caused by our unauthorized disclosures of confidential information, breaches of data security, failure to remedy system failures or other material contract breaches.\nWe frequently receive or have access to confidential information from our clients, including confidential client data that we use to develop or support solutions. If any person, including one of our employees, misappropriates client confidential information, or if client confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems, including an attack by computer programmers or hackers who may develop or deploy viruses, worms, or other malicious software programs, system failures or otherwise, we may have substantial liabilities to our clients or their customers. Further, any such compromise to our computer systems could disrupt our operations, as well as our clients\u2019 operations.\nFurther, many of our assignments involve technology applications or systems that are critical to the operations of our clients\u2019 businesses and handle very large volumes of transactions. If we fail to perform our services correctly, we may be unable to deliver applications or systems to our clients with the promised functionality or within the promised time frame, or to satisfy the required service levels for support and maintenance. Any such failures by us could result in claims for substantial damages by our clients against us.\nWe may be liable for breaches of confidentiality or data security, defects in the applications or systems we deliver or other material contract breaches that we may commit during the performance of our services (collectively, \u201cContract Breaches\u201d). In certain circumstances, we agree to unlimited liability for Contract Breaches. Additionally, we cannot be assured that any insurance coverage will be applicable and enforceable in all cases, or sufficient to cover substantial liabilities that we may incur. Further, we cannot be assured that contractual limitations on liability will be applicable and enforceable in all cases. Accordingly, even if our insurance coverage or contractual limitations on liability are found to be applicable and enforceable, our liability to our clients for Contract Breaches could be material in amount and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, such claims may harm our reputation and cause us to lose clients.\nRisks Related to our Temporary Employee Staffing Business (IT Staffing Business)\nWe face significant employment-related legal risk.\nWe employ people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. Many of these individuals have access to client information systems and confidential information. An inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of errors and omissions; intentional misconduct; release, misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property, confidential information, funds, or other property; cyber security breaches affecting our clients and/or us; discrimination and harassment claims; employment of undocumented aliens; criminal activity; torts; or other claims. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, civil litigation, payment by us of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse effects on our business. To reduce our exposure, we maintain insurance coverage for professional malpractice liability, fidelity, employment practices liability, and general liability in amounts and with deductibles that we believe is appropriate for our operations. Our insurance coverage, however, may not cover all potential claims against us, may require us to meet a deductible or may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost.\nIn this regard, we face various employment-related risks not covered by insurance, such as wage and hour laws and employment tax responsibility. U.S. Courts in recent years have been receiving large numbers of wage and hour class action claims alleging misclassification of overtime eligible workers and/or failure to pay overtime-eligible workers for all hours worked. In addition, there appears to be a heightened state and federal scrutiny of independent contractor relationships, which could adversely affect us given that we utilize a significant number of independent contractors to perform our services. An adverse determination of the independent contractor status of these firms could result in a substantial tax or other liabilities.\nWe may be adversely affected by government regulation of the staffing business, and of the workplace.\nOur business is subject to regulation and licensing in many states. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. If we fail to comply, such failure could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nA large part of our business entails employing individuals and placing such individuals in clients\u2019 workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship could have a material adverse effect on us.\nSignificant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities.\nProfessional service providers are subject to legal actions alleging malpractice, breach of contract and other legal theories. These actions may involve large claims and significant defense costs. We may also be subject to claims alleging violations of federal or state labor laws. In addition, we may be subject to claims related to torts, intentional acts or crimes committed by our full-time employees or temporary staffing personnel. In some instances, we are contractually obligated to indemnify clients against such risks. A failure to observe the applicable standard of care, relevant 6D Global or client policies and guidelines, or applicable federal, state, or local laws, rules, and regulations could result in negative publicity, payment of fines, significant damage awards, or settlement expense. To reduce our exposure, we maintain insurance coverage for professional malpractice liability, fidelity, employment practices liability and general liability, in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations. Our insurance coverage, however, may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost.\nSignificant increases in payroll-related costs could adversely affect our business.\nWe are required to pay a number of federal, state and local payroll and related costs, including unemployment taxes, workers\u2019 compensation and insurance premiums and claims, FICA, and Medicare, among others, related to our employees. Significant increases in the effective rates of any payroll-related costs would likely have a material adverse effect on us. Over the last few years, many of the states in which we conduct business have continued to significantly increase their state unemployment tax rates in an effort to increase funding for unemployment benefits. Costs could also increase as a result of health care reforms or the possible imposition of additional requirements and restrictions related to the placement of personnel. We may not be able to increase the fees charged to our clients in a timely manner or in a sufficient amount to cover these potential cost increases.\nRisks Related to Our Business Generally\nOur markets are highly competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete effectively.\nThe markets for the services we provide are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and subject to rapid technological change. We compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms, traditional and digital advertising and marketing agencies, offshore consulting and outsourcing companies, and clients\u2019 internal information systems departments. Other competitors include boutique consulting firms that maintain specialized skills or are geographically focused. Many of the larger regional and national information technology consulting firms have substantially longer operating histories, more established reputations and potential vendor relationships, greater financial resources, sales and marketing organizations, market penetration, and research and development capabilities, as well as broader product offerings, greater market presence, and name recognition. We may face increasing competitive pressures from these competitors. This may place us at a disadvantage to our competitors, which may harm our ability to grow, maintain revenues, or generate net income.\nIn addition, a significant amount of information technology services are being provided by lower-cost non-domestic resources. The increased utilization of these resources for U.S.-based projects could result in lower revenues and margins for U.S.-based information technology companies. Our ability to compete utilizing higher-cost domestic resources and/or our ability to procure comparably priced offshore resources could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, there are relatively low barriers to entry in these markets. Therefore, new entrants may compete with us in the future. For example, due to the rapid changes and volatility in our market, many well-capitalized companies, including some of our partners, that have focused on sectors of the software and services industry that are not competitive with our business may refocus their activities and deploy their resources to be competitive with us.\nIn recent years, there has been consolidation in our industry and we expect that there will be additional consolidation in the future. As a result of this consolidation, we expect that we will increasingly compete with larger firms that have broader product offerings and greater financial resources than we have. We believe that this competition could have a negative effect on our marketing, distribution and reselling relationships, pricing of services and products, and our product development budget and capabilities. One or more of our competitors may develop and implement methodologies that result in superior productivity and price reductions without adversely affecting their profit margins. In addition, competitors may win client engagements by significantly discounting their services in exchange for a client\u2019s promise to purchase other goods and services from the competitor, either concurrently or in the future. These activities may potentially force us to lower our prices and suffer reduced operating margins. Any of these negative effects could significantly impair our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we cannot keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace, our business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer.\nWe depend on the proper functioning of our information systems.\nWe are dependent on the proper functioning of information systems in operating our business. Critical information systems are used in every aspect of our daily operations, most significantly, in the identification and matching of staffing resources to client assignments and in the customer billing and consultant or vendor payment functions. Our information systems are vulnerable to fire or casualty theft, technical failures, terrorist acts, cyber security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or software intrusions, computer viruses, and similar events. If our critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, we would have to accomplish these functions manually, which could prove difficult or impossible, causing a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlso, any theft or misuse of information resulting from a security breach could result in, among other things, loss of significant and/or sensitive information, litigation by affected parties, financial obligations resulting from such theft or misuse, higher insurance premiums, governmental investigations, negative reactions from current and potential future customers (including potential negative financial ramifications under certain customer contract provisions) and poor publicity and any of these could adversely affect our financial results\nWe may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from the Exchange.\nThe Exchange involved changing our name and transitioning our core business. We are devoting significant management attention and resources to transitioning 6D Global. However, the Exchange may present certain risks to our business and operations including, among other things, risks that:\n\u00b7\nthe transition of our core business may take longer, be more difficult, time-consuming or costly to accomplish than expected;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to avoid unforeseen increased expenses associated with the Exchange;\n\u00b7\nthere may be unanticipated changes in the markets for our core business;\n\u00b7\nbranding or rebranding initiatives may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by customers;\n\u00b7\nthere may be unanticipated downturns in business relationships with customers; and\n\u00b7\nthere may be increases in the cost of material, energy and other production costs, or unexpected costs that cannot be recouped in product pricing.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the following eventualities will occur: (i) the Exchange will result in the realization of the full benefits of transitioning our core business that we currently expect; (ii) the potential benefits of transitioning will be achieved within the anticipated timeframe; or (iii) we will be able to implement new strategies to transform the newly renamed and rebranded company. Failure to successfully transition the businesses may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nAcquisitions could have negative consequences, which could harm our business.\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading \u201cBusiness,\u201d part of our business strategy entails acquiring companies or business units along with their synergistic product lines. This strategy could require significant capital infusions and could involve many risks including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\ndifficulty integrating the acquired company\u2019s personnel, products, product roadmaps, technologies, systems, processes and operations, including product delivery, order management, and information systems;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in forming the acquired company\u2019s financial policies and practices to our policies and practices and in implementing and maintaining adequate internal systems and controls over financial reporting and information systems of the acquired company;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention and disruption of ongoing business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in combining service and technology offerings and entering into new markets or geographical areas in which we have no or limited direct experience and where our competitors may have stronger market positions;\n\u00b7\nloss of management, sales, technical or other key personnel;\n\u00b7\nrevenue from the acquired companies not meeting our expectations, and the potential loss of the acquired companies\u2019 customers, distributors, resellers, suppliers, or other partners;\n\u00b7\ndelays or difficulties and the attendant expense in evaluating, coordinating, and combining administrative, sales, research and development and other operations, facilities, and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures, including financial controls and controls over information systems;\n\u00b7\nincurring amortization expense related to intangible assets and recording goodwill and non-amortizable assets that will be subject to impairment testing and possible impairment charges;\n\u00b7\ndilution of existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities, including the assumption of any stock options or other equity awards issued by the acquired company;\n\u00b7\noverpayment for any acquisition or investment or unanticipated costs or liabilities;\n\u00b7\nresponsibility for the liabilities of the acquired company, including any potential intellectual property infringement claims or other litigation; and\n\u00b7\nincurring substantial write-offs, restructuring charges, and transactional expenses.\nOur failure to manage these risks and challenges could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, if we do not successfully address these challenges in a timely manner, we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies on which the value of a transaction was based. Future transactions could cause our financial results to differ from expectations of market analysts or investors for any given year, which could, in turn, cause a decline in our stock price.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business.\nOur success depends in large part upon the continued services of a number of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our employment arrangements with key personnel provide that employment is terminable at will by either party. Competition for such personnel is intense. If our key personnel resign to join a competitor or to form a competing company, the loss of such personnel and any resulting loss of existing or potential clients or employees to any such competitor could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot be certain that any agreements we require our employees to enter into will be effective in preventing them from engaging in these actions or that courts or other adjudicative entities will substantially enforce these agreements.\nWe may not be able to recognize revenue in the period in which our services are performed, which may contribute to fluctuations in our revenue and margins.\nWe provide our services primarily under time-and-materials contracts. All revenue is recognized pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). These principles require us to recognize revenue once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. If we perform our services prior to the period in which we are able to recognize the associated revenue, our revenue and margins may fluctuate from year to year.\nWe have significant fixed operating costs, which may be difficult to adjust in response to unanticipated fluctuations in revenues.\nA high percentage of our operating expenses, particularly salary expenses, rent, depreciation expenses and amortization of purchased intangible assets, are fixed in advance of any particular year. As a result, an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of, or an unanticipated delay in the scheduling for, our assignments, may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular year, and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that year.\nAn unanticipated termination or decrease in size or scope of a major assignment, a client\u2019s decision not to proceed with an assignment we anticipated or the completion during a year of several major client assignments could require us to maintain underutilized employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our revenues and earnings may also fluctuate from year to year because of such factors as:\n\u00b7\nthe contractual terms and timing of completion of assignments, including achievement of certain business results;\n\u00b7\nany delays incurred in connection with assignments;\n\u00b7\nthe adequacy of provisions for losses and bad debts;\n\u00b7\nthe accuracy of our estimates of resources required to complete ongoing assignments; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions.\nWe rely on short-term engagements with most of our clients, and our clients may terminate their contracts with short notice.\nMost of our customer relationships are not exclusive and most of our contracts may be terminated by our clients with limited advance notice and without significant penalty. Our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future and/or develop their own competitive services. Accordingly, our business agreements with these customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors, or for other reasons, or might not meet their contractual obligations to us. A client\u2019s termination of a contract for our services could result in a loss of expected revenues and additional expenses for staff that were allocated to that client\u2019s assignment. We may be required to maintain underutilized employees who were assigned to terminated contracts. The unexpected cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of any of our large assignments, or client termination of one or more recurring revenue contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face certain risks in collecting our trade accounts receivable and we have a small number of customers who account for a significant amount of our revenues.\nWe generate a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from our customers. Delays or defaults in payments owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could cause a delay or default include business failures, turmoil in the financial and credit markets, sluggish or recessionary U.S. economic conditions, our exposure to customers in high-risk sectors such as the financial services industry, and declines in the credit worthiness of our customers.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had two significant customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. During 2015, for both clients we provided consultants to develop and install a value adding digital solution. Our sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 56% and 52% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately 56% and 57% of our accounts receivable balance held by five customers, respectively. During each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had three customers accounting for more than 10% each of its accounts receivables balances, respectively.\nWe may not be able to maintain sufficient cash flow or borrowing capacity to support operations, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.\nWe may require additional financing from time to time to implement our growth strategy. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. Even if we are able to raise capital through equity or debt financings, as to which there can be no assurance, the interest of existing stockholders in our company may be diluted, and the securities we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock or may otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies.\nAs discussed in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, we have been sued in shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits regarding our financial disclosures and our Board\u2019s oversight of our business, and as a publicly-traded company we cannot be assured that similar actions will not be brought against us in the future. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we\u2019re ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.\nOur failure to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or our identification of any other material weaknesses in the future may adversely affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting.\nAs further described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management, with the participation of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)) as of March 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation and the material weaknesses described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to our company required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. The material weaknesses relate to our inability to timely file our reports and other information with the SEC as required under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, together with material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are (i) ineffectiveness of the Board of Directors, (ii) our lack of the quantity of resources and personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge and experience in the application of U.S. GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements, and (iii) our lack of information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) governance, physical safeguards and access to programs and data.\nAs further described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have implemented remediation measures and we are in the process of identifying any additional appropriate remediation measures. There is the potential that our remediation efforts may not be successful. Until our remediation plan is fully implemented, our management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we fail to complete our remediation plan in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remediation plan is inadequate or we encounter difficulties in the implementation or maintenance of our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, any failure to implement our remediation plan or any difficulties we encounter with our remediation plan could result in additional material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control or future material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements. Further, if any other material weakness or deficiency in our internal control exist and go undetected, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future, could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations. Moreover, our failure to remediate the material weakness identified above or the identification or additional material weaknesses, could adversely affect our stock price and investor confidence.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nNASDAQ has determined to delist our common stock\nTrading of our common stock on NASDAQ was halted in September 2015 as a result of the criminal and civil allegations made against Benjamin Wey and others relating to allegedly improper trading activities involving predecessor companies. Subsequently, NASDAQ determined to delist our common stock pursuant to its discretionary authority, as well as due to our failure to timely file our annual and quarterly reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and pay NASDAQ\u2019s annual fee. On June 20, 2016 we were notified that our appeal of NASDAQ\u2019s delisting decision had been denied, and we expect that our common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ.\nWhen our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ and transferred to the over-the-counter market, the spreads between the bid and ask prices for our common stock may increase and the execution time for orders may be longer. The delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ may result in decreased liquidity, thereby making the trading of our common stock more difficult. In addition, delisting from the NASDAQ might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nOur common stock does not have substantial trading volume. As a result, relatively small trades of our common stock may have a significant impact on the price of our common stock and, therefore, may contribute to the price volatility of our common stock. Because of the limited trading volume in our common stock and the price volatility of our common stock, stockholders may be unable to sell their shares of common stock when they desire or at the price they desire. The inability for our stockholders to sell their shares in a declining market because of such illiquidity or at a price they desire may substantially increase their risk of loss.\nOur Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer has significant voting power and may effectively control the outcome of any stockholder vote.\nTejune Kang, current Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of 6D Global, personally is in control of multiple Limited Liability Corporations (\u201cLLCs\u201d) that hold in the aggregate, approximately 29.8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of June 30, 2016. NYGG (Asia), Ltd. holds, in the aggregate, approximately 44.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of June 30, 2016. In addition, on January 14, 2016, NYGG Asia entered into an agreement and proxy with the Company that will result in NYGG Asia\u2019s shares being voted in the same proportion as the shares not held by NYGG Asia are voted. This agreement will, however, terminate upon the delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ. As a result, Mr. Kang has the ability to substantially influence and, so long as the NYGG Asia proxy remains in effect, effectively control the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of 6D Global, even if such a change in control would benefit other investors.\nFuture sales or issuances of securities may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nPursuant to a stock purchase agreement, we have issued and sold to Discover Growth Fund 1,088 shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company. Such shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible into a total of 2,072,381 shares of our common stock, and upon the conversion of such shares, we also will be required to pay the stockholder dividends, as well as any applicable Conversion Premium, at our sole and absolute discretion, either in cash or in shares of our common stock. The number of shares of our common stock that may be issued pursuant to the Conversion Premium and if we elect to pay such dividends in shares may be significant, but cannot be determined at this time because the applicable calculations are based on our stock price during a period surrounding the date of the conversion. In addition, the dividend rate has increased by 10 percentage points as a result of the suspension and delisting of our common stock. Any such issuances of our common stock as a result of the conversion of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock will dilute the proportionate ownership and voting power of existing stockholders and may cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nThe Company has reserved all available authorized, but unissued common stock\nWe are required to reserve three times the number of shares of common stock required to immediately issue all shares potentially issuable in relation to the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. This has resulted in us reserving all of our authorized, but unissued, common stock for possible conversion.\nBecause we have reserved all of our authorized, but unissued common stock, we may have a reduced ability to consummate acquisitions and may not be able to grant stock options (or other securities) convertible into common stock or satisfy an exercise of any existing convertible securities.", "PERMNO": 12485, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SIXD"}
