{"cik": "869495", "company": "DEEP WELL OIL & GAS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-12-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of our Company before deciding to invest in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we presently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our Company. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny Development Of Our Resources Will Be Subject To Crown Royalties. The royalty regime of Alberta is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production in Alberta, Canada. Crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical location, field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced. Penalties and interest may be charged to us if we fail to remit royalties on our production to the Crown as prescribed in the regulation.\nWe Have A History Of Losses And May Not Achieve Or Sustain Profitability In The Future. Since our inception, we have suffered recurring losses from operations and have been dependent on new investment to sustain our operations. During the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 we reported net losses of $1,884,667 and $1,995,858 respectively. We may not achieve profitability in the foreseeable future, if at all. In addition, our operating expenses may be more than our future revenue growth. We expect our future cost of revenue and operating expenses to continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to expand on our thermal recovery operations at Sawn Lake, Alberta.\nFuture Price Declines May Result In A Write-Down Of Asset Carrying Values. Effective July 1, 2015, our Company adopted the full-cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil sands properties. Under the full cost method, oil and gas properties are subject to a ceiling test performed quarterly. A ceiling test write-down is recognized in net earnings if the carrying amount of a cost centre exceeds the \u201ccost centre ceiling\u201d. The cost centre ceiling is the sum of: (i) present value of the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves using a 10 percent per year discount factor; (ii) the costs of unproved properties not being amortized; (iii) the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized; and (iv) related income tax effects. During the 2015 and 2014 fiscal year, no ceiling test write-downs were recorded for our oil and gas properties. Costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until it is determined that proved reserves are attributable or impairment has occurred. Unproved properties are assessed annually for impairment. Costs that have been impaired are included in the costs subject to depletion within the full cost pool. A significant decline in oil prices from current levels, or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could cause a future write-down of our capitalized costs and a non-cash charge on our income statement.\nThe Successful Implementation Of Our Business Plan Is Subject To Risks Inherent In The Oil Sands Business. Our oil sands operations are subject to the economic risks typically associated with exploration, development and production activities, including the necessity of significant expenditures to locate and acquire properties and to drill exploratory wells. In addition, the cost and timing of drilling, completing, operating and acquiring regulatory approval for thermal recovery operations on our wells is often uncertain. In conducting exploration and development activities, the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations, miscalculations or accidents may cause our exploration, development and production activities to be unsuccessful. This could result in a total loss of our investment in a particular property. If our efforts are unsuccessful in establishing proven reserves, the amounts capitalized as unproven costs may be written down and charged against earnings. Our exploitation and development of oil sands reserves depends upon access to the areas where our operations are to be conducted. We conduct a portion of our operations in regions where we are only able to do so on a seasonal basis. Unless the surface is sufficiently frozen, we are unable to access our properties, drill or otherwise conduct our operations as planned. In addition, if the surface thaws earlier than expected, we must cease our operations for the season earlier than planned. Our operations are affected by road bans imposed from time to time during the break-up and thaw period in the spring. Road bans are also imposed due to spring-break up, heavy rain, mud, rock slides and periods of high water, which can restrict access to our well sites and potential production facility sites. Our inability to access our properties or to conduct our operations as planned would result in a shutdown or slowdown of our operations, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe Rely On Independent Experts And Technical Or Operational Service Providers Over Whom We May Have Limited Control. The success of our business is dependent upon the efforts of various third parties that we do not control. We rely upon various companies to assist us in identifying desirable oil prospects to acquire and to provide us with technical assistance and services. We also rely upon the services of geologists, geophysicists, chemists, engineers and other scientists to explore and analyze oil prospects to determine a method in which the oil prospects may be developed in a cost-effective manner. In addition, we rely upon the owners and operators of oil drilling equipment to drill and develop our prospects to production. Although we have developed relationships with a number of third-party service providers, we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to rely on such persons. If any of these relationships with third-party service providers are terminated or are unavailable on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business plan. Our limited control over the activities and business practices of these third parties, any inability on our part to maintain satisfactory commercial relationships with them or their failure to provide quality services could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Interests Are Held In The Form Of Leases That We May Be Unable To Retain. Our Sawn Lake oil sands properties are held as leases with working interests ranging from 25% to 100%. These leases to which we are a party are for a fixed term of 15 years, but contain a provision that allows us to extend the term of the lease so long as we meet the minimum level of evaluation as set out by the government of Alberta tenure guidelines. If we fail to meet the specific requirements of the lease regarding delay or non-payment of rental payments or we fail to meet the minimum level of evaluation, some or all of our leases may terminate or expire. There can be no assurance that any of the obligations required to maintain each lease will be met. The termination or expiration of our leases or the working interests relating to leases may reduce our opportunity to exploit a given prospect for production and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Expect Our Operating Expenses To Increase Substantially In The Future And We May Need To Raise Additional Funds. We have a history of net losses and expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially over the next 12 months as we continue to develop our oil sands leases. In addition, we may experience a material decrease in liquidity due to unforeseen cash calls or other events and uncertainties. As a result, we may need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available on favourable terms, if at all. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Ability To Produce Sufficient Quantities Of Oil From Our Properties May Be Adversely Affected By A Number Of Factors Outside Of Our Control. The business of exploring for and producing oil and gas involves a substantial risk of investment loss. Drilling oil wells involves the risk that the wells may be unproductive or that, although productive, the wells may not produce oil in economic quantities. Other hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations, pressures, fires, blowouts, loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well. Adverse weather conditions can also hinder drilling operations. A productive well could become uneconomic due to, for example, pressure depletion, water encroachment or mechanical difficulties, which could impair or prevent the production from the well. There can be no assurance that oil will be produced from all of our properties in which we have interests. Marketability of any oil that we acquire or discover may be influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. The marketability of our production will depend on the proximity of our reserves to and the capacity of, third party facilities and services, including oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines, trucking or terminal facilities, and processing facilities. The unavailability or insufficient capacity of these facilities and services could force us to shut-in producing wells, delay the commencement of production, or discontinue development plans for some of our properties, which would adversely affect our financial condition and performance. There may be periods of time when pipeline capacity is inadequate to meet our oil transportation needs. During periods when pipeline capacity is inadequate, we may be forced to reduce production or incur additional expense as existing production is compressed to fit into existing pipelines. Other risk factors include availability of drilling and related equipment, market fluctuations of prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, allowable production and environmental protection. Our ability to manage these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Do Not Control All Of Our Operations. We do not operate all of our oil sands properties and we therefore have limited influence over the testing, drilling and production operations of those properties. Currently, we have a 90% working interest in 51 sections on six oil sands leases, a 100% working interest in five sections on one oil sands lease, where we are the operator of the 90% and 100% leases. We also have a 25% working interest in an additional 12 sections on two oil sands leases where one of our joint venture partners is the operator. These nine oil sands leases, which are all contiguous, cover 43,015 gross acres (17,408 gross hectares) where we currently have 34,096 net acres (13,798 net hectares). All nine oil sands leases are located in the Peace River oil sands area of Alberta, Canada. Our lack of operational control of the 12 sections currently not operated by us means we are exposed to the following possibilities:\n\u00b7 the operator might initiate exploration or development on a faster or slower pace than we prefer, or shut-in a currently existing project;\n\u00b7 the operator might propose to drill more wells or build more facilities on a project than we have funds for or that we deem appropriate, which could mean that we are unable or decline to participate in the project or share in the revenues generated by the project;\n\u00b7 if the operator does not initiate a joint operation proposal to conduct further operations on these 12 sections, the non-operators are entitled to propose a joint operation that is separate from any already existing project. As a non-operator on those 12 sections, we might be unable to pursue further operations on those sections unless we and possibly other joint participating non-operators directly pay the entire cost thereof.\nAny of these events could materially reduce the value of those properties affected.\nAboriginal Peoples May Make Claims Regarding The Lands On Which Our Operations Are Conducted. Aboriginal peoples have claimed aboriginal title and rights to a substantial portion of western Canada. Since aboriginal peoples have filed a claim claiming aboriginal title or rights to the lands on which some of our properties are located, and if such a claim is successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe AER governs our operations in Alberta, Canada and they have implemented a directive (\u201cDirective 056\u201d) through which the government of Alberta has issued its First Nations Consultation Policy on Land Management and Resource Development on May 16, 2005. The AER expects that all industry applicants must adhere to this policy and the consultation guidelines. These requirements and expectations apply to the licensing of all new energy developments and all modifications to existing energy developments, as covered in Directive 056. In the policy, the government of Alberta has developed consultation guidelines to address specific questions about how consultation for land management and resource development should occur in relation to specific activities. Prior to filing an application, the applicant must address all questions, objections, and concerns regarding the proposed development project and attempt to resolve them. This includes concerns and objections raised by members of the public, industry, government representatives, First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and other interested parties. This process can cause significant delays in obtaining a drilling permit for exploration and/or a production well license for both oil and gas.\nOur Operations Are Subject To A Wide Range of Environmental Legislation and Regulation From All Levels Of Government Of Which We Have No Control. Environmental legislation imposes, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment. As well, environmental regulations are imposed on the qualities and compositions of the products sold and imported. Environmental legislation also requires that wells, facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. In addition, certain types of operations, including exploration and development projects and significant changes to certain existing projects, may require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. Compliance with environmental legislation can require significant expenditures, and failure to comply with environmental legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties and liability for cleanup costs and damages. The costs of complying with environmental legislation in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We anticipate that changes in environmental legislation may require, among other things, reductions in emissions to the air from its operations and result in increased capital expenditures. Future changes in environmental legislation could occur and result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket Fluctuations In The Prices Of Oil Could Adversely Affect Our Business. Prices for oil tend to fluctuate significantly in response to factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the ongoing wars in the Middle East and actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its maintenance of production constraints, the U.S. economic environment, weather conditions, the availability of alternate fuel sources, transportation interruption, the impact of drilling levels on crude oil and natural gas supply, and the environmental and access issues that could limit future drilling activities for the industry.\nChanges in commodity prices may significantly affect our capital resources, liquidity and expected operating results. Price changes directly affect revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to reinvest in exploration and development activities. Reductions in oil could not only reduce revenues and profits, but could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable. Significant declines in oil prices could result in non-cash charges to earnings due to write-downs.\nChanges in commodity prices may also significantly affect our ability to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and divestiture and often cause disruption in the market for oil producing properties, as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on the value of the properties. Price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation of projects. We expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future.\nOur Stock Price Could Decline. Our common stock is traded on the OTC marketplace. There can be no assurance that an active public market will continue for our common stock or that the market price for our common stock will not decline below its current price. Such price may be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to, investor perception of us and our industry and general economic and market conditions. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to announcements of our business developments or our competitors, quarterly variations in operating results, and other events or factors. In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price volatility in recent years. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of companies, at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. Such broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our stock price may decline as a result of future sales of our shares or the perception that such sales may occur.\nWe Could Be Subject To SEC Penalties If We Do Not File All Of Our SEC Reports. We have not timely filed this current Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequent Annual Report of Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2016, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as required to be filed by us with the SEC, in a timely manner. It is possible that the SEC could take enforcement action against us, including potentially the de-registration of our securities, if we fail to file our annual and quarterly reports in a timely manner as required by the SEC. If the SEC were to take any such actions, it could adversely affect the liquidity of trading in our common stock and the amount of information about our Company that is publicly available.\nBroker-Dealers Are Not Permitted To Solicit Trades In Our Common Stock. Our common stock is considered to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d because it meets one or more of the definitions of \u201cpenny stock\u201d in Rule 3a51-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). The principal result or effect of being designated a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is that securities broker-dealers cannot recommend the stock and may only trade in it on an unsolicited basis. The continued inability of brokers to recommend our stock could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related To Broker-Dealer Requirements Involving Penny Stocks / Risks Affecting Trading and Liquidity. Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15g-2 promulgated thereunder by the SEC require broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor\u2019s account. These rules may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market, if and when one develops.\nPotential investors in our common stock are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Moreover, SEC Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Pursuant to the Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, broker-dealers are further obligated to provide customers with monthly account statements. Compliance with the foregoing requirements may make it more difficult for investors in our stock to resell their shares to third parties or to alternatively dispose of them in the market or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 81072, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "DWOG"}
