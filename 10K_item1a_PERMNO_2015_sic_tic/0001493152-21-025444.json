{"cik": "1005731", "company": "IDT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-10-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks as well as the other risks highlighted elsewhere in this document, particularly the discussions about regulation, competition, and intellectual property. The trading price of our Class B common stock could decline due to any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Businesses\nEach of our BOSS Revolution Calling and Carrier Services businesses is highly sensitive to declining prices, which may adversely affect our revenues and margins.\nThe worldwide telecommunications industry is characterized by intense price competition, which has resulted in declines in both our average per-minute price realizations and our average per-minute termination costs. Many of our competitors continue to aggressively price their services. The intense competition has led to continued erosion in our pricing power, in both our retail and wholesale markets, and we have generally had to pass along all or some of the savings we achieve on our per-minute costs to our customers in the form of lower prices. In the case of some international calling locations, when average per minute termination cost decline to a nominal amount, indirect competitors, such as wireless carriers, may include calls to those locations at no extra cost, which increases our risk of losing customers. Any price increase by either our BOSS Revolution Calling, or Carrier Services business may result in our prices not being as attractive, which may result in a reduction of revenue. If these trends in pricing continue or accelerate, it could have a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our BOSS Revolution Calling and Carrier Services businesses and/or our gross margins.\nOur results of operations are significantly dependent upon BOSS Revolution Calling, which generates a significant portion of our revenue.\nWe compete in the international prepaid calling market with Tier 1 mobile network operators who offer flat rate international calling plans, other PIN-less prepaid voice offerings, prepaid calling card providers, mobile virtual network operators, and VoIP and other OTT service providers. Many of these companies, such as AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, engineering, personnel, and marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, and larger customer bases than we do. We may not be able to compete successfully if one or more of these companies use their substantial resources in or to affect the international prepaid calling market.\nIn addition to these larger competitors, we face significant competition from smaller prepaid calling providers.\nFrom time-to-time, competitors offer rates that are substantially below ours to gain market share. In some instances, these rates are below what we believe to be the cost to provide the service. This predatory pricing can adversely affect our revenues and our gross margins.\nThe continued growth of OTT calling and messaging services, such as WhatsApp Viber, Skype and others have adversely affected the sales of BOSS Revolution Calling. We expect the popularity of IP-based services-many of which offer free voice and/or video communications provided both the caller and recipient have a broadband connection-to continue to increase, which will increase substitution for, and pricing pressure on, BOSS Revolution Calling.\nMany wireless operators offer unlimited international long-distance plans that include international destinations to which customers can place direct calls from their mobile phones without time limitation. These plans now include some of our most popular international destinations. The growth of these \u201cinternational unlimited\u201d plans adversely affects our revenues as these operators gain subscriber market share from BOSS Revolution Calling.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively with BOSS Revolution Calling, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, gross margins and/or profits.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient or cost-effective termination capacity to particular destinations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nMost of our telecommunications traffic is terminated through third-party providers. In order to support our minutes of use demands and geographic footprint, we may need to obtain additional termination capacity or destinations. We may not be able to obtain sufficient termination capacity from high-quality carriers to particular destinations or may have to pay significant amounts to obtain such capacity. This could result in our not being able to support our minutes of use demands or in higher cost-per-minute to particular destinations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nThe termination of our carrier agreements with partners or our inability to enter into carrier agreements in the future could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete, which could reduce our revenues and profits.\nWe rely upon our carrier agreements with partners in order to provide our telecommunications services to our customers. These carrier agreements are for finite terms and, therefore, there can be no guarantee that these agreements will be renewed at all or on favorable terms to us. Our ability to compete would be adversely affected if our carrier agreements were terminated or we were unable to enter into carrier agreements in the future to provide our telecommunications services to our customers, which could result in a reduction of our revenues and profits.\nOur customers, particularly our Carrier Services customers, could experience financial difficulties, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability if we experience difficulties in collecting our receivables.\nAs a provider of international long-distance services, we depend upon sales of transmission and termination of traffic to other long-distance providers and the collection of receivables from these customers. The wholesale telecommunications market continues to feature many smaller, less financially stable companies. If weakness in the telecommunications industry or the global economy reduces our ability to collect our accounts receivable from our major customers, particularly our wholesale customers, our profitability may be substantially reduced. While our most significant customers, from a revenue perspective, vary from quarter to quarter, our five largest Carrier Services customers collectively accounted for 4.5% and 6.5% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Our Carrier Services customers with the five largest receivables balances collectively accounted for 8.8% and 13.3% of our total gross trade accounts receivable at July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This concentration of revenues and receivables increases our exposure to non-payment by our larger customers, and we may experience significant write-offs if any of our large customers fail to pay their outstanding balances, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur revenues and profits will suffer if our distributors and sales representatives fail to effectively market and distribute our BOSS Revolution and Mobile Top-Up products and services.\nWe rely on our distributors and representatives to market and distribute our BOSS Revolution products and services, and our Mobile Top-Up offerings. We utilize a network of several hundred sub-distributors that sell our BOSS Revolution products and services and our Mobile Top-Up offerings to retail outlets throughout most of the United States. If our distributors or sales representatives fail to effectively market or distribute our BOSS Revolution products and services, or our Mobile Top-Up offerings, our ability to generate revenues and profits and grow our customer base in these products and services could be substantially impaired.\nNatural or man-made disasters could have an adverse effect on our technological infrastructure, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nNatural disasters, terrorist acts, acts of war, cyberattacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations. Although we make significant efforts towards managing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, our inability to operate our telecommunications networks because of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in loss of revenue, significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain functions related to our business depend on a single supplier or small group of suppliers to carry out our business, and the inability to do business with some or all of these suppliers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIf the services of any of the single suppliers or small group of suppliers, including, without limitation, software from third-party service providers used in certain of our products and services, that we depend on were unavailable, or available only in decreased capacity or at less advantageous terms, this could result in interruptions to our ability to provide certain services, could cause reduction in service and/or quality as the function is transitioned to an alternate provider, if an alternate provider is available, or could increase our cost, which in the current competitive environment, we may not be able to pass along to customers. Accordingly, any of these events could materially and negatively impact our business, our revenues, our profits, and our relationships with customers.\nCyberattacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business.\nCyberattacks, including through the use of malware, ransomware, computer viruses, denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyberattacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers\u2019 operations. Furthermore, ransomware could potentially deny the use of our systems until a ransom is paid. Cyberattacks against companies, including us, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. They may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyberattacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyberattacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a cyberattack in the future.\nThe inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyberattacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to us and/or a loss of market share. The costs associated with a major cyberattack on us could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. Further, certain of our businesses, such as those offering cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyberattack. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.\nWe could be harmed by network disruptions, security breaches, or other significant disruptions or failures of our IT infrastructure and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nTo be successful, we need to continue to have available, for our and our customers\u2019 use, a high-capacity, reliable and secure network. We face the risk, as does almost any company, of a security breach, whether through cyberattacks, malware, computer viruses, sabotage, or other significant disruption of our IT infrastructure and related systems. As such, there is a risk of a security breach or disruption of the systems we operate, including possible unauthorized access to our and our customers\u2019 proprietary or classified information.\nWe are also subject to breaches of our network resulting in unauthorized utilization of our services or products, which subject us to the costs of providing those products or services, which are likely not recoverable. The secure maintenance and transmission of our and our customer\u2019s information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer information, or those of service providers or business partners, may be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security, or that of a third-party service provider or business partner, or impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third-party service provider or business partner. As a result, our or our customers\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without the customers\u2019 consent, or our products and services may be used without payment.\nAlthough we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and systems, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging, especially in light of the growing sophistication of cyberattacks and intrusions sponsored by state or other interests. We may be unable to anticipate all potential types of attacks or intrusions or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures. Certain of our business units have been the subject of attempted and successful cyberattacks in the past. We have researched the situations and do not believe any material internal or customer information has been compromised.\nNetwork disruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described systems could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations or those of certain of our customers; (ii) result in the unauthorized use of our services or products without payment, (iii) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; (iv) require significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the damages that result or to change our systems and processes; (v) subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, fines, penalties, termination or other remedies; or (vi) result in a loss of business, damage our reputation among our customers and the public generally, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to litigation. Any or all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nWe believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization, in particular our technology and software engineering organization. Competition for qualified technology and engineering employees is intense and our compensation arrangements may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nNew and existing technologies could affect our ability to track the results of ads and/or could block ads online, which would harm our business.\nTechnologies have been developed to make tracking the results of our online advertisements more difficult or to block the display of advertisements altogether and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the core functionality of third-party digital advertising. A significant portion of our revenues are derived from customers acquired in connection with the display of advertisements online. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe long-term success of NRS depends on our ability to develop products and services to address the rapidly evolving market for POS products and services, and, if we are not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for our products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nRapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the POS market. These new services and technologies may be superior to, impair, or render obsolete the POS products and services that NRS currently offers or the technologies NRS currently uses to provide them. Incorporating new technologies into NRS\u2019 POS products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and NRS may not be successful in realizing a return on these development efforts in a timely manner or at all. NRS\u2019 ability to develop new products and services may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, existing and future laws and regulations, resistance to change from our customers, which includes our sellers and their buyers, or third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. NRS\u2019 success will depend, in part, on its ability to develop new technologies and to adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If NRS is unable to provide enhancements and new features for our products and services or to develop new products and services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and evolving industry standards, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nSubstantial and increasingly intense competition in the POS industry may harm NRS\u2019 business.\nNRS competes in the POS market that is characterized by vigorous competition, changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. We expect competition to intensify in the future as existing and new competitors introduce new services or enhance existing services. NRS competes against many companies to attract customers, and some of these companies have greater financial resources and substantially larger bases of customers than NRS does, which may provide them with significant competitive advantages. These companies may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, may achieve economies of scale due to the size of their customer bases, and may more effectively introduce their own innovative products and services that adversely impacts NRS\u2019 growth. Currently, we believe that we have a competitive advantage because of our focus and marketing reach into independent stores, often in immigrant communities in the United States. If some or all of our competitors focus additional resources on those customers, NRS\u2019 growth may slow, or we may lose customers due to the competition. Mergers and acquisitions by these companies may lead to even larger competitors with more resources.\nNRS may also face pricing pressures from competitors. Some potential competitors are able to offer lower prices to sellers for similar services by subsidizing their payments services through other services they offer. Such competition may result in the need for NRS to alter the pricing that it offers and could reduce our gross profit.\nIf NRS fails to convince brands of the benefits of advertising on its platform, our business could be harmed.\nNRS\u2019 strategy includes increasing its revenues from brand advertising. Brands may not do business with NRS or may reduce the amounts they are willing to spend to advertise if NRS does not deliver ads, and other commercial content and marketing programs in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with NRS will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. NRS\u2019 ability to grow the number of brands that use its brand advertising, and ultimately to generate advertising and marketing services revenues, depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If NRS fails to convince brands of the benefits of advertising on its platform, our business could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to ensure that certain of our services and hardware, particularly those of NRS and net2phone, integrate with third-party operating systems and devices, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain of our products and services, particularly those offered by NRS and net2phone, are dependent on the ability to integrate with a variety of third-party operating systems and devices that we do not control. Any changes in these systems that degrade the functionality of these products and services, impose additional costs or requirements on it, or give preferential treatment to competitive services, including their own services, could materially and adversely affect usage of certain of our products and services particularly those offered by NRS and net2phone. If we are unable to ensure that our hardware and software continue to interoperate effectively or if doing so is costly, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf net2phone fails to adapt its products and services to rapid changes in the market for cloud communications services, then its products and services could become obsolete or less competitive.\nThe market for net2phone\u2019s products and services is constantly and rapidly evolving as its competitors introduce new and enhanced products and services and react to changes in the cloud communications services industry and customer demands. net2phone may not be able to develop or acquire new products and services or product and service enhancements that compete effectively with present or emerging cloud communication services and technologies. In addition, net2phone may not be able to establish or maintain strategic alliances that will permit enhancement opportunities or innovative distribution methods for its products and services.\nCloud communications services are complex, and new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Any delays in developing and releasing new or enhanced products could cause net2phone to lose revenue opportunities and customers. Any technical flaws in products net2phone releases could diminish the quality and innovative impact of the products and have a negative effect on customer adoption and its reputation.\nnet2phone is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. New products based on new technologies or new industry standards could render its existing products obsolete and unmarketable. If new technologies develop that can deliver competing voice, video, and messaging services at lower prices, better or more conveniently, it could have a material adverse effect on net2phone and us.\nnet2phone\u2019s success in the cloud communications market for business services depends in part on developing and maintaining effective distribution channels. The failure to develop and maintain these channels could materially and adversely affect its business.\nA significant portion of net2phone\u2019s revenues are generated through indirect channel sales. These channels consist of third-party channel partners and value-added distributors that market and sell net2phone\u2019s products and services to business customers. These channels may generate an increasing portion of net2phone\u2019s revenues in the future. Generally, net2phone does not have long-term contracts with these third-party channel partners and value-added distributors, and the loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could materially reduce its revenues. net2phone also competes for preference amongst its current or potential channel partners with its competitors. net2phone\u2019s continued success requires that it continue developing and maintaining successful relationships with these third-party channel partners and value-added distributors. If net2phone fails to do so, or if its channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts, its sales may decrease, and its and our operating results would suffer.\nAs the cloud communications market evolves, and the convergence of voice, video, messaging, mobility, and data networking technologies accelerates, net2phone may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete in the cloud communications services market.\nAs the cloud communications market evolves, combining voice, video and messaging with data networks, information technology and communication applications, an opportunity is created for new competitors to enter the cloud communications services market and offer competing products, including companies that currently compete in other sectors, companies that serve consumers rather than business customers, or companies which expand their market presence to include business communications. This potential competition may take many forms and may offer products and applications similar to net2phone\u2019s. If new competitors emerge, the cloud communications services market will become increasingly competitive, and net2phone may not be able to maintain or improve its market position. net2phone\u2019s failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe could fail to comply with requirements imposed on us by certain third parties, including regulators, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, revenues, and profits.\nA significant and increasing portion of our transactions are processed using debit cards, credit cards, and other digital payment methods. The banks, credit card companies, networks, and other payment processing providers impose strict regulatory, compliance, system, and other requirements to participate in such parties\u2019 payment systems. We are required to comply with the privacy provisions of various federal and state privacy statutes and regulations, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, each of which is subject to change at any time. Compliance with PCI DSS does not guarantee a completely secure environment and notwithstanding the results of this assessment there can be no assurance that payment card brands will not request further compliance assessments or set forth additional requirements to maintain access to credit card processing services. Compliance with PCI DSS is an ongoing effort, and the requirements evolve as new threats are identified. Compliance with these requirements is often difficult and costly, and our failure, or our counterparty\u2019s failure, to comply may result in significant fines or civil penalties, regulatory enforcement action, liability under or termination of necessary agreements related to our payment services business, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and/or operations and that of our distributors who could be liable as well. Further, our payment services are subject to stringent requirements by regulators and trade organizations in various jurisdictions. Our payment services unit is subject to federal and state banking regulations, and we are also subject to further regulation by those states in which we are licensed as a money transmitter. We may not be able to comply with all such requirements in a timely manner or remain in compliance. If we are not in compliance, we could be subject to penalties or the termination of our rights to participate in such payment systems or provide such services, which could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our businesses and our revenues and profits.\nOur business, results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected by the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions put in place in connection therewith.\nWe are responding to the global outbreak of COVID-19 by taking steps to mitigate the potential risks to us posed by its spread and the impact of the restrictions put in place by governments to protect the population. We continue to execute our business continuity plan and have implemented a comprehensive set of actions for the health and safety of our employees, customers, and business partners. Our employees transitioned to work-from-home during fiscal 2020 and, to a large degree, continue to work-from-home. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain of our employees returned to our offices on a part-time basis.\nWe continue to implement strong physical and cyber-security measures to ensure our systems remain functional to both serve our operational needs with a remote workforce and to provide uninterrupted service to our customers. We face challenges due to the need to operate with the remote workforce and are addressing those challenges to minimize the impact on our ability to operate.\nThe impacts of COVID-19 and related public health restrictions had a mixed, but, in the aggregate, positive financial impact on our business, operations and financial condition. Negative impacts of COVID-19 on our business in fiscal 2020 that were somewhat or mostly mitigated in fiscal 2021 included:\n\u25a0 net2phone-UCaaS\u2019 customer base growth slowed initially in certain international markets as churn increased and sales became increasingly difficult;\n\u25a0 Reduction in the operations or the closure of independent retailers that offer our BOSS Revolution service or utilize our NRS services;\n\u25a0 Decreased retail consumer traffic resulting from concerns about the spread of COVID-19 pressured retail sales;\n\u25a0 Carrier Services\u2019 revenues were impacted by the closure of corporate offices, the decline of commerce globally, and the rapid growth of video conferencing solutions such as Zoom; and\n\u25a0 Reduced staffing levels in our field operations.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic continues for a prolonged period or has a more significant impact than currently, our business, operations, and financial condition could be impacted in more significant ways. The continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus could have the following impacts, in addition to exacerbating the impacts described above:\n\u25a0 Adversely impact our strategic business plans and growth strategy;\n\u25a0 Result in increases in bad debt expense and accounts receivable write-offs as a result of delayed or non-payment from our customers;\n\u25a0 Reduce demand for our offerings as widespread unemployment reduces consumer buying power;\n\u25a0 Reduce the availability and productivity of our employees and third-party resources;\n\u25a0 Cause us to experience an increase in costs as a result of our emergency measures;\n\u25a0 Cause impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets; and\n\u25a0 Cause a deterioration in our financial metrics or the business environment that adversely impacts our credit ratings.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we had not experienced significant adverse impacts to our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows due to the impact of COVID-19. However, the situation remains fluid and we cannot predict with certainty the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe have attempted to control our operating expenses by utilizing lower-cost labor in foreign countries such as Belarus, Guatemala, and Israel and we may in the future expand our reliance on offshore labor to other countries. Our employees in Belarus and Israel primarily help develop, test, and maintain certain of our technology. Our labor source in Guatemala primarily performs certain call center, administrative, and customer acquisition functions. We also have significant operations in Brazil and Argentina as a result of net2phone\u2019s growth.\nCountries outside of the United States may be subject to relatively higher degrees of political and social instability and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. The occurrence of natural disasters, pandemics, such as COVID-19, or political or economic instability in these countries could interfere with work performed by these labor sources or could result in our having to replace or reduce these labor sources. If countries in which we operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially when such unrest leads to an unseating of the established government, our operations in such countries could be materially impaired. Our vendors in other countries could potentially shut down suddenly for any reason, including financial problems or personnel issues. Such disruptions could decrease efficiency, increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nFor example, in August 2020, political unrest in Belarus related to its elections resulted in our Belarus operations being nearly unable to operate for multiple days and significantly reduced productivity in our Belarus operations for multiple weeks.\nThe practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries has come under increased scrutiny in the United States. Governmental authorities could seek to impose financial costs or restrictions on foreign companies providing services to customers or companies in the United States. Governmental authorities may attempt to prohibit or otherwise discourage us from sourcing services from offshore labor.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations prohibit certain types of payments by our employees, vendors, and agents. Any violation of the applicable anti-corruption laws or regulations by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents could expose us to significant penalties, fines, settlements, costs, and consent orders that may curtail or restrict our business as it is currently conducted and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWeakness of the United States dollar in relation to the currencies used in these foreign countries may also reduce the savings achievable through this strategy and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur U.K.-based businesses and business between the United Kingdom and other countries face risks related to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d).\nWe operate our business worldwide, including meaningful operations in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, we are subjected to risks from changes in the regulatory environment in various countries. On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, or EU, (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The United Kingdom formally left the EU on April 30, 2020 and had entered a transition period until December 31, 2020. The EU and the United Kingdom concluded the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the \u201cTCA\u201d) on December 24, 2020, which took effect provisionally on January 1, 2021, following the end of the formal transition period and will become formally applicable once ratified by both the United Kingdom and the EU. The TCA sets out the arrangements between the United Kingdom and EU on trade in certain areas (e.g., goods and some services, energy, fisheries, social security coordination), however there is still uncertainty over how its terms will play out in practice and there are still key aspects of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the EU which are not covered by the TCA, such as in respect of financial services. We expect that uncertainty over the terms of the TCA and other future agreements between the United Kingdom and EU will continue to cause political and economic uncertainty, which could harm our business and financial results. The withdrawal will, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the EU, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. Until there is greater understanding on how the terms of the TCA will play out in practice, and until the terms of other potential agreements that the United Kingdom may eventually enter into with the EU are known, it is not possible to determine the extent of the impact that the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the EU and/or any related matters may have on us; however, any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Likewise, similar actions taken by European and other countries in which we operate could have a similar or even more profound impact.\nFurther, Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets, and the value of the Pound Sterling currency or other currencies, including the Euro. We are exposed to the economic, market, and fiscal conditions in the United Kingdom and the EU and to changes in any of these conditions.\nIDT Financial Services Limited, or IDTFS, our Gibraltar-based bank, currently operates under a license from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission. As an overseas British Territory, following the expiration of the Brexit transition period, the passporting rights previously enjoyed by IDTFS under EU law have ceased to be in effect. Although we are currently seeking an e-money license issued by an EU country, since this was not secured prior to expiration of the transition period, alternative arrangements were made with third parties to service customers in EU countries previously serviced by IDTFS. Our inability to service these customers will lead to a reduction in the revenues previously earned from them.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis\nWe cannot be certain that we will continue to maintain an effective system of internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The New York Stock Exchange, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nRisk Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe hold cash, cash equivalents, debt securities and equity investments that are subject to various market risks.\nAt July 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, debt securities, and current equity investments of $163.6 million. Debt securities and equity investments carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that we can redeem them at any time and that our investment managers will be able to accurately predict the course of price movements and, in general, the securities markets have in recent years been characterized by great volatility and unpredictability. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of cash, cash equivalents, debt securities and equity investments could be materially and adversely affected.\nIntellectual Property, Tax, Regulatory, and Litigation Risks\nWe provide communications and payment services to consumers and are therefore subject to various federal and state laws and regulations.\nAs a provider of communications and payment services to consumers, such as BOSS Revolution Calling or BOSS Revolution Money Transfer, we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to the manner in which we advertise our services, describe and present the terms of our services, and communicate with our customers and consumers in general. Compliance with these laws requires us to be constantly vigilant as they often vary from state to state. Failure to comply with these laws could result in action being taken by federal and state agencies or offices responsible for consumer protection, like the Federal Trade Commission which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, revenues, and profits.\nWe may be adversely affected if we fail to protect our proprietary technology.\nWe depend on proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights in conducting our various business operations. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. Failure of our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technology and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to more effectively compete with us and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be required to litigate in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any such litigation.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights of others, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, revenues, and profits.\nCompanies in the telecommunications industry and other industries in which we compete own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property claims against us grows. Although we do not believe that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. From time to time we may be subject to claims and legal proceedings from third parties regarding alleged infringement by us of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights. Such suits can be expensive and time consuming and could distract us and our management from focusing on our businesses. Further, loss of such suits could result in financial burdens and the requirement to modify our modes of operation, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to tax and regulatory audits which could result in the imposition of liabilities that may or may not have been reserved.\nWe are subject to audits by taxing and regulatory authorities with respect to certain of our income and operations. These audits can cover periods for several years prior to the date the audit is undertaken and could result in the imposition of liabilities, interest and penalties if our positions are not accepted by the auditing entity.\nOur 2017 FCC Form 499-A, which reports our calendar year 2016 revenue is currently under audit by the Universal Service Administrative Company, or USAC. The Internal Audit Division of USAC issued preliminary audit findings and we have, in accordance with audit procedures, appealed certain of the findings. We are awaiting a final decision by USAC on the preliminary audit findings. Depending on the findings contained in the final decision, we may further appeal to the FCC. As of July 31, 2021, our accrued expenses included $38.3 million for FCC-related regulatory fees for the year covered by the audit, as well as prior and subsequent years. If we do not properly calculate, or have not properly calculated, the amount payable by us to the FCC, we may be subject to interest and penalties.\nWe are subject to value added tax, or VAT, audits from time-to-time in various jurisdictions. In the conduct of such audits, we may be required to disclose information of a sensitive nature and, in general, to modify the way we have conducted business with our distributors until the present, which may affect our business in an adverse manner.\nWe are also subject to audits in various jurisdictions for various other taxes, including utility excise tax, sales and use tax, communications services tax, gross receipts tax and property tax.\nWe may be subject to state sales taxes that we have not paid, collected from our customers, or reserved for on our financial statements, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOn June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., holding that a state may require a remote seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales tax on goods and services provided to purchasers in the state, overturning certain existing court precedent. We have evaluated our state tax filings with respect to the Wayfair decision and are in the process of reviewing our remittance practices. It is possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability for periods for which we have not collected sales, use or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. One or more jurisdictions may change their laws or policies to apply their sales, use or other similar taxes to our operations, and if such changes were made it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business is subject to strict regulation under federal law regarding anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing. Failure to comply with such laws, or abuse of our programs for purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nProvisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and other federal laws impose substantial regulations on financial institutions that are designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist organizations. Increasing regulatory scrutiny of our industry with respect to money laundering and terrorist financing matters could result in more aggressive enforcement of these laws or the enactment of more onerous regulation, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, abuse of our money transfer services or prepaid card programs for purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, notwithstanding our efforts to prevent such abuse through our regulatory compliance and risk management programs, could cause reputational or other harm that would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations intended to help detect and prevent illegal or illicit activity and our failure, or the failure of one of our disbursement partners or payment processors to comply with those laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur money transfer and network branded prepaid card services are subject to a strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other illicit activity. The interpretation of those requirements by judges, regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies is changing, often quickly and with little notice. Economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. As federal, state, and foreign legislative regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action in these areas increase, we expect our costs to comply with these requirements will increase, perhaps substantially. Failure to comply with any of these requirements by us, our regulated retailers or our disbursement partners could result in the suspension or revocation of a money transmitter license, the limitation, suspension or termination of our services, the seizure and/or forfeiture of our assets and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines.\nFurthermore, failure by us or our agents to comply with applicable laws and regulations could also result in termination of contracts with our banks and/or merchant payment processors. Termination of services by one of our retail banks would seriously diminish our ability to collect funds from our BOSS Revolution agents. Likewise, termination of services by our merchant processor would negatively impact our ability to process payments in our digital channels.\nThe foregoing laws and regulations are constantly evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, making compliance challenging. If we fail to update our compliance system to reflect legislative or regulatory developments, we could incur penalties. New legislation, changes in laws or regulations, implementing rules and regulations, litigation, court rulings, changes in industry practices or standards, changes in systems rules or requirements or other similar events could expose us to increased compliance costs, liability, reputational damage, and could reduce the market value of our money transfer and network branded prepaid card services or render them less profitable or obsolete.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could harm us and the scope of our activities, and could harm our operations, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in the United States on July 21, 2010, calls for significant structural reforms and substantive regulation across the financial services industry. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, whose purpose is to issue and enforce consumer protection initiatives governing financial products and services, including money transfer services.\nWe may be subject to examination by the CFPB, which has broad authority to enforce consumer financial laws. The CFPB has a large budget and staff and has broad authority with respect to our money transfer service and related business. It is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, the CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, and new model disclosures. The CFPB\u2019s authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators, or to rescind or alter past regulatory guidance, could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Counsel that is authorized to designate as \u201csystemically important\u201d non-bank financial companies and payment systems. Companies designated under either standard will become subject to new regulation and regulatory supervision. If we were designated under either standard, the additional regulatory and supervisory requirements could result in costly new compliance burdens or may require changes in the way we conduct business that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to licensing and other requirements imposed by U.S. state regulators, and the U.S. federal government. If we were found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations governing money transmitters, we could lose our licenses, be subject to liability or be forced to change our business practices, which could harm our operations, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA number of states and territories have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters, with 49 states requiring a license as of July 31, 2021. At July 31, 2021, we had obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter in 48 U.S. states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. We are also registered as money services businesses with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or FinCEN. As a licensed money transmitter, we are subject to bonding requirements, liquidity requirements, restrictions on our investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, and inspection by state and foreign regulatory agencies. If we were found to be subject to and in violation of any banking or money services laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability or additional restrictions, such as increased liquidity requirements. In addition, our licenses could be revoked, or we could be forced to cease doing business or change our practices in certain states or jurisdictions or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on us. Regulators could also impose other regulatory orders and sanctions on us. Any change to our business practices that makes our service less attractive to customers or prohibits use of our services by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease our transaction volume and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur disbursement partners generally are regulated institutions in their home jurisdiction, and money transfers are regulated by governments in both the United States and in the jurisdiction of the recipient. If our disbursement partners fail to comply with applicable laws, it could harm our business., results of operations, and financial condition.\nMoney transfers are regulated by state, federal and foreign governments. Many of our disbursement partners are banks that are heavily regulated by their home jurisdictions. Our non-bank disbursement partners are also subject to money transfer regulations. We require regulatory compliance as a condition to our continued relationship, perform due diligence on our disbursement partners, and monitor them periodically with the goal of meeting regulatory expectations. However, there are limits to the extent to which we can monitor their regulatory compliance. Any determination that our disbursement partners or their sub-disbursement partners have violated laws and regulations could seriously damage our reputation, resulting in diminished revenue and profit and increased operating costs. While our services are not directly regulated by governments outside the United States, except with respect to our Gibraltar bank as discussed below, it is possible that in some cases we could be liable for the failure of our disbursement partners or their sub-disbursement partners to comply with laws, which also could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIDTFS in Gibraltar is regulated by the Gibraltar FSC, and, as such, is subject to Gibraltarian and EU laws relating to financial institutions. As an issuer of prepaid debit cards for programs operated by other entities, commonly known as program managers, IDTFS is responsible, inter alia, for anti-money laundering laws oversight and compliance. If we were to fail to implement the requisite controls or follow the rules and procedures mandated by the FSC and applicable law, we could be subject to regulatory fines, and even the loss of our banking license.\nWe receive, store, process and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe receive, store, and process personal information and other customer data, including bank account numbers, credit and debit card information, identification numbers, and images of government identification cards. As a result, we are required to comply with the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the PCI DSS. There are also numerous other federal, state, local and international laws , such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other customer data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions or conflict with other applicable rules. It is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our business practices.\nAdditionally, with advances in computer capabilities and data protection requirements to address ongoing threats, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against potential security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, or litigation. If there is a breach of credit or debit card information that we store, we could also be liable to the issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, a significant breach could result in our being prohibited from processing transactions for any of the relevant network organizations, such as Visa or MasterCard, which would harm our business. If any third parties with whom we work, such as marketing partners, vendors, or developers, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may put our customers\u2019 information at risk and could harm our business. Any negative publicity arising out of a data breach or failure to comply with applicable privacy requirements could damage our reputation and cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial position, and potential for growth.\nWe may be harmed by certain imminent FCC Orders and rules that effect the telecommunications marketplace.\nIn the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence, or TRACED, Act, Congress gave the FCC new tools to fight unwanted, and often illegal, robocalls, the top consumer complaint reported to the FCC annually. The TRACED Act required the FCC to mandate the STIR/SHAKEN caller identification framework. STIR/SHAKEN enables phone companies to verify that the caller ID information transmitted with a call matches the caller\u2019s real phone number. The FCC has issued a series of Orders and adopted several rules to implement the TRACED Act. For example, by June 30, 2021, many domestic and foreign carriers must register with the FCC specifically for TRACED Act compliance. Initially, the FCC concluded that by September 28, 2021, we and other similarly situated carriers would not be able to accept certain IP-based telecommunications traffic from foreign and domestic carrier partners unless those carriers are registered with the FCC. However, the FCC temporarily suspended this obligation while it reconsiders its impact. We believe the FCC will eventually reinstate the rule or implement a new rule that will have a comparable impact upon us and the industry as a whole. Of equal importance, carriers such as us have the right to \u201csign\u201d their traffic, effectively attesting that the traffic they are transmitting is not illegal robocalls.\nThe FCC\u2019s rules present several concerns to all carriers. Notably, the rules extend to many foreign carriers, and it is unclear whether foreign carriers will be sufficiently educated and experienced to implement U.S. rules and regulations. Foreign carrier compliance, or the lack thereof, could impact U.S. carriers as they seek to meet their own regulatory obligations. There may also be changes in the marketplace as foreign carriers may look to limit U.S. carrier partners to whom they transmit calls for termination in the U.S. that are subject to the STIR/SHAKEN rules.\nWe anticipate meeting our regulatory obligations under the STIR/SHAKEN rules and we are undertaking efforts to prevent us from being harmed by potential changes in the marketplace. Nevertheless, the FCC\u2019s rules allow for the possibility that well-prepared carriers with anti-robocalling procedures in place may fail and be punished for their failure, despite their best efforts. Moreover, because the STIR/SHAKEN rules may have a significant impact on the telecommunications marketplace, it is difficult to predict their outcome. We are prepared for the implementation of STIR/SHAKEN but are concerned about its impact on the market as a whole and on us specifically.\nFederal and state regulations may be passed that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to provide VoIP communications services at attractive rates arises in large part from the fact that VoIP services are not currently subject to the same level of regulation as traditional, switch-based telephony. The use of the Internet and private IP networks to provide voice communications services is largely unregulated within the United States, although several foreign governments have adopted laws and/or regulations that could restrict or prohibit the provision of voice communications services over the Internet or private IP networks. If interconnected VoIP services become subject to state regulation and/or additional regulation by the FCC, such regulation will likely lead to higher costs and reduce or eliminate the competitive advantage interconnected VoIP holds, by virtue of its lesser regulatory oversight, over traditional telecommunications services. More aggressive regulation of the Internet in general, and Internet telephony providers and services specifically, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to offer services outside of the United States is subject to the local regulatory environment, which may be unfavorable, complicated, and often uncertain.\nRegulatory treatment outside the United States varies from country to country. We distribute our products and services through resellers that may be subject to telecommunications regulations in their home countries. The failure of these resellers to comply with these laws and regulations could reduce our revenue and profitability or expose us to audits and other regulatory proceedings. Regulatory developments such as these could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn many countries in which we operate, or our services are sold, the status of the laws that may relate to our services is unclear. We cannot be certain that our customers, resellers, or other affiliates are currently in compliance with regulatory or other legal requirements in their respective countries, that they or we will be able to comply with existing or future requirements, and/or that they or we will continue in compliance with any requirements. Our failure or the failure of those with whom we transact business to comply with these requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we expect additional regulation of our industry in some or all of these areas, and we expect continuing changes in the regulatory environment as new and proposed regulations are reviewed, revised and amended, we cannot predict with certainty what impact new laws in these areas will have on us, if any.\nnet2phone\u2019s VoIP services are subject to regulation in the United States and Canada. Future legislative, regulatory, or judicial actions could adversely affect net2phone\u2019s business and expose it to liability and limit its growth potential.\nThe United States and Canada have applied some traditional telephone company regulations to VoIP and continue to evaluate how VoIP should be regulated, as are other countries as we expand globally. The effects of future regulatory developments are uncertain. At the federal level in the United States, the FCC has imposed certain telecommunications regulations on VoIP services including, but not limited to:\n\u25a0 Requirements to provide E-911 service;\n\u25a0 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act obligations;\n\u25a0 Obligation to support Universal Service;\n\u25a0 Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI, requirements;\n\u25a0 Disability access obligations;\n\u25a0 Local Number Portability requirements; and\n\u25a0 Consumer protection, including protection from unwanted telemarketing and other calls.\nIn Canada, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, or CRTC, regulates VoIP Service. These regulated services are similar to those regulated in the United States discussed above. Future legislative, judicial, or other regulatory actions could have a negative effect on net2phone\u2019s business. If net2phone becomes subject to additional rules and regulations applicable to telecommunications providers we may incur significant litigation and compliance costs, and net2phone may have to restructure its service offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of its services, any of which could cause its services to be less attractive to customers. In addition, future regulatory developments could increase our cost of doing business and limit our growth.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.\nVarious legal proceedings that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of business have not been finally adjudicated, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition (see Item 3 to Part I \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report).\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nHolders of our Class B common stock have significantly less voting power than holders of our Class A common stock.\nHolders of our Class B common stock are entitled to one-tenth of a vote per share on all matters on which our stockholders are entitled to vote, while holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to three votes per share. As a result, the ability of holders of our Class B common stock to influence our management is limited.\nEight trusts for the benefit of sons and daughters of Howard S. Jonas, our Chairman of the Board, hold shares that, in the aggregate, represent more than a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, which may limit the ability of other stockholders to affect our management.\nEight trusts for the benefit of children of Howard S. Jonas (the \u201cTrusts\u201d), our Chairman of the Board, collectively have voting power over 1,574,326 shares of our Class A common stock, (which is all the issued and outstanding shares of the Class A common stock), which are convertible into shares of our Class B common stock on a 1-for-1 basis, and 2,382,371 shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 69.5% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, as of October 12, 2021. Each of the Trusts has a different, independent trustee. In addition, as of October 12, 2021, The HSJ 2020 IDT Annuity Trust holds 2,219,821 shares of our Class B common stock and The HSJ 2020 IDW-Zedge Annuity Trust holds 119,311 shares of our Class B common stock. Both of these trusts have an independent trustee.\nHoward S. Jonas serves as our Chairman of the Board, which is not an officer position. However, he is our founder and served as an executive officer, including our Chief Executive Officer, for a very significant time period, and the members of the Board and management often look to him for guidance on major financial, operational and strategic matters.\nHoward S. Jonas does not have the right to direct or control the voting of the shares of our common stock that is held by the Trusts, and the independent trustees hold sole voting and dispositive power over the common stock held by the Trusts. However, he is the trustor of the trusts and is the father of each of the beneficiaries of the Trusts and his views may be taken into account by the trustees and others related to the Trusts.\nWe are not aware of any voting agreement between or among any of the Trusts and/or Howard S. Jonas, but if such a voting agreement or other similar arrangement exists or were to be consummated, if all or several of the Trusts were to act in concert, or if we issued additional Class A common stock, certain or all of the Trusts and/or Howard S. Jonas along with holders of the Class A common stock would be able to control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of all of the directors, amendment of organizational documents and the approval of significant corporate transactions, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As a result, the ability of any of our other stockholders to influence our management may be limited. In addition, our dual class structure has an anti-takeover effect, and accordingly, the holders of the shares of Class A common stock have the ability to prevent any change in control transactions that may otherwise be in the best interest of stockholders.", "PERMNO": 88988, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "IDT"}
