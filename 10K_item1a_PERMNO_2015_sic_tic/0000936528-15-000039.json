Investors should carefully consider, in addition to the other information set forth herein, the following risk factors:\nCurrent economic conditions pose challenges for us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are operating in an uncertain economic environment, including lackluster national and global conditions, accompanied by very low interest rates. Financial institutions can be affected by changing conditions in the real estate and financial markets. Dramatic declines in the housing market in past years, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. While conditions have improved, a return to a recessionary economy could result in financial stress on our borrowers that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Deteriorating conditions in the regional economy served by the Company could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses. We may also face the following risks in connection with events:\n\u25aa\nIneffective monetary policy could cause rapid changes in interest rates and asset values that would have a materially adverse impact on our profitability and overall financial condition.\n\u2022\nMarket developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities.\n\u2022\nThe processes we use to estimate the allowance for loan losses and other reserves may prove to be unreliable. Such estimates rely upon complex modeling inputs and judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, that may be rendered inaccurate and/or no longer subject to accurate forecasting.\n\u2022\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite loans become less predictive of future charge-offs.\n\u2022\nRegulatory scrutiny of the industry could increase, leading to harsh regulation of our industry that could lead to a higher cost of compliance, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and increase our exposure to the judicial system and the plaintiff\u2019s bar.\n\u2022\nFurther erosion in the fiscal condition of the U.S. Treasury could lead to new taxes that would limit the ability of the Company to pursue growth and return profits to shareholders.\nIf these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition.\nThe effects of the economic recession were severe in our primary market areas.\nSubstantially all of our loans are to individuals, businesses and real estate developers in the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Utah, Texas, New Mexico and Nevada, and our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in these market areas. Unemployment rates have improved but continue to be high in most of our market areas. Severe declines in housing prices and property values were acute in our primary market areas. Most areas are improving in real estate values. However, a further deterioration in economic conditions or a prolonged delay in economic recovery in our primary market areas could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business:\n\u2022\nLoan delinquencies may increase.\n\u2022\nProblem assets and foreclosures may increase.\n\u2022\nDemand for our products and services may decline.\n\u2022\nCollateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer's borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans.\nA downturn in the real estate market would hurt the Company's business.\nThe Company's business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in real estate lending. The market for real estate is cyclical and the outlook for this sector is uncertain. A downturn in the real estate market, accompanied by falling values and increased foreclosures would hurt the Company's business because a large majority of our loans are secured by real estate.\nActions by other lenders or bank regulators could depress the value of our real estate holdings, if lenders aggressively dispose of properties because of demand by their regulators or the prevailing business conditions. If a significant decline in market values occurs, the collateral for the Company's loans will provide decreasing levels of security. As a result, the Company's ability to\nrecover the principal amount due on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished, and the Company will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.\nWe own real estate as a result of foreclosures resulting from non-performing loans. If other lenders or borrowers liquidate significant amounts of real estate in a rapid or disorderly fashion, or if the FDIC elects to dispose of significant amounts of real estate from failed financial institutions in a similar fashion, it could have an adverse effect on the values of the properties we own. In such a case, we may incur further write-downs and charge-offs, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may suffer losses in its loan portfolio despite its underwriting and loan collection practices.\nThe Company seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting and loan collection practices. Underwriting practices often include analysis of a borrower's prior credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections; valuation of collateral; personal guarantees of loans to businesses; and verification of liquid assets. If the underwriting process fails to capture accurate information or proves to be inadequate, we may incur losses on loans that appeared to meet our underwriting criteria, and those losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in the allowance for loan losses. Loan collection resources may be expanded to meet increases in nonperforming loans resulting from economic downturns or to service any loans from our acquisitions, resulting in higher loan administration costs. The Company is also exposed to the risk of improper documentation of foreclosure proceedings that would also increase the cost of collection. There is also the risk that loss sharing agreements with the FDIC may not be fulfilled.\nThe Company is in the process of upgrading its core technology infrastructure which may expose the Company to significant risks.\nThe Bank is completing a four-year program to transition the Bank from its stable, cost-efficient but aging legacy operating system to a more modern, efficient, scalable system. The Bank\u2019s capacity to successfully provide its products and services to its customers is dependent on a successful migration to the third-party system and the ability of the third party to provide the necessary services. Any disruption of such services, or the termination of a third-party license or service agreement related thereto, could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s ability to provide and service customer products.\nIn addition, when the Bank acquires other institutions or branches, the success and value of the transaction can depend in part on the Bank\u2019s ability to seamlessly integrate the acquired customers\u2019 services and products with the Bank\u2019s technology platform. Failure to do so can lead to, among other things, dissatisfaction among acquired customers and the loss of the business of such customers.\nThe Company has risk of systems failures and security risk, including \"hacking\" and \"identity theft.\"\nThe Bank relies extensively on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information technology and telecommunications systems. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems and could damage our reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject us to regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. This applies to our internally developed systems and the systems of our third-party service providers.\nWhile the Bank believes it has robust information systems and security procedures, controls and policies designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur, or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate protective measures.\nTo date the Bank has not experienced any material losses related to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks and losses in the future. The Bank\u2019s risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our plans to continue to implement our internet banking and mobile banking channels, our expanding operations and use of third-party information systems.\nCybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect customer information, our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Company. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or refine our protective measures against these threats.\nThe Company's business is subject to interest rate risk and changes in market interest rates may negatively affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Bank's primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets and the interest expense generated by our interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is a function of the average balances of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the amounts of the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and the mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the \u201cFOMC\u201d), and market interest rates. Management is unable to predict these external factors, including the fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many drivers, including inflation, recession, unemployment, monetary policy, domestic and international disorder, instability in domestic and foreign financial markets, and investor and consumer demand.\nFurthermore, the level of net interest income is influenced by movements in interest rates, the pace at which such movements occur, and the volume and mix of our interest-bearing assets and liabilities. The cost of our deposits is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is driven by the FOMC. However, the yields generated by our long term loans, such as single-family residential and multifamily mortgage loans, and securities are typically driven by longer-term (10 year) interest rates, which are set by the market and vary from day to day. During the last few years the Federal Reserve's unprecedented involvement in the purchase of assets, commonly know as \"quantitative easing\", has caused interest rates to be lower than than they would have been without such involvement. The timing and impact of the withdrawal of this quantitative easing remains unknown.\nIf the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-earning assets, the result could be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in our earnings. Our net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on our interest-earning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits; the fair values of our securities and other financial assets; the fair values of our liabilities; and the average lives of our loan and securities portfolios. Additionally, decreases in interest rates could lead to increased loan refinancing activity which, in turn, would alter the balance of our interest-earning assets and impact net interest income. Increases in interest rates could reduce loan refinancing activity which could result in compression of the spread between loan yields and more quickly rising funding rates.\nThe Company may be exposed to movements in market rates to a degree not experienced by other financial institutions. The Company must carefully manage interest rate risk as a result of its significant portfolio of fixed-rate single-family home loans which are longer-term in nature than the customer accounts and borrowed money that constitute its liabilities. The Company manages its interest rate risk in part by growing the fixed-rate loan portfolio when yields are higher and focusing on loans or investments with shorter term characteristics, such as construction or commercial loans, when loan rates are lower. This balance sheet strategy in conjunction with a strong capital position has allowed the Company to manage interest rate risk through all interest rate cycles. Low operating costs have contributed further to the strong capital position. Although the company has implemented asset and liability management policies and procedures that seek to minimize or contain this interest rate risk, these policies may not be successful in the future.\nThe Company relies, in part, on external financing to fund its operations and the unavailability of such funds in the future could adversely impact its growth and prospects.\nThe Company relies on customer deposits, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines and other borrowings to fund its operations. Management has historically been able to replace maturing deposits if desired; however the Company may not be able to replace such funds at any given point in time if its financial condition or market conditions change or if the cost of doing so might adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough the Company considers its sources of funds adequate for its liquidity needs, it may seek additional debt in the future to achieve its long-term business objectives. Such borrowings, if sought, may not be available to the Company or, if available, may not be on favorable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe Company's ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations which may affect its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from its subsidiary and does not have significant operations of its own. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by the Bank's earnings and capital, as well as various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank may not pay dividends to the Company. If\nthe Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay dividends on its common stock. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including those discussed below. The market price of our common stock has in the past fluctuated significantly and is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly. Some of the factors that may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our and our competitors' operating results\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts' estimates of our future performance and the future performance of our competitors\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships\n\u2022\nadditions or departure of key personnel\n\u2022\nevents affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the financial markets and real estate markets\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the United States\n\u2022\nthe presence or absence of short selling of our common stock\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or debt securities\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations. These fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nA person holding our common stock could have the voting power of their shares of common stock on all matters significantly reduced under Washington's anti-takeover statutes, if the person acquires in excess of 10% of the voting power in the election of directors.\nThe Company is incorporated in the state of Washington and subject to Washington state law. Some provisions of Washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change-in-control events affecting us. For example, Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, with limited exceptions, prohibits a \u201ctarget corporation\u201d from engaging in specified \u201csignificant business transactions\u201d for a period of five years after the share acquisition by an acquiring person, unless:\n\u25aa\nthe prohibited transaction or the acquiring person's purchase of shares was approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation's board of directors prior to the acquiring person's share acquisition; or\n\u25aa\nthe prohibited transaction was both approved by the majority of the members of the target corporation's board and authorized at a shareholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares (excluding the acquiring person's shares) at or subsequent to the acquiring person's share acquisition. An acquiring person is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially own 10% or more of the voting securities of the target corporation. Such prohibited transactions include, among other things:\n\u25aa\ncertain mergers, or consolidations with, disposition of assets to, or issuances of stock to or redemption of stock from, the acquiring person;\n\u25aa\ntermination of 5% or more of the employees of the target corporation as a result of the acquiring person's acquisition of 10% or more of the shares;\n\u25aa\nallowing the acquiring person to receive any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder; and\n\u25aa\nliquidating or dissolving the target corporation.\nAfter the five-year period, certain \u201csignificant business transactions\u201d are permitted, if they comply with certain \u201cfair price\u201d provisions of the statute or are approved by a majority of the outstanding shares other than those of which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership. As a Washington corporation, we are not permitted to \u201copt out\u201d of this statute.\nOur results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising from certain industry deficiencies in foreclosure practices, including delays and challenges in the foreclosure process.\nForeclosure process issues and the potential legal and regulatory responses to them could negatively impact the process and timing to completion of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders, including the Bank. Foreclosure timelines have increased in recent years due to, among other reasons, delays associated with the significant increase in the number of foreclosure cases as a result of economic downturns, additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process and voluntary or, in some cases, mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. Increases in the foreclosure timeline may have an adverse effect on collateral values and our ability to minimize our losses.\nOur ability to originate mortgage loans for portfolio has been adversely affected by the increased competition resulting from the involvement of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve and Government-Sponsored Enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d) in the residential mortgage market.\nOver the past few years, we have faced increased competition for mortgage loans due to the increased involvement of the GSEs in the mortgage market as a result of the recent economic crisis, which has caused interest rates for thirty year fixed-rate mortgage loans that conform to GSE guidelines to remain artificially low. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has participated in the mortgage market in an unusual manner, through its purchases of GSE mortgage-backed securities as part of its \"quantitative easing\" program. Our one-to-four family mortgage loan repayments have been elevated, and it is possible that our one-to-four family mortgage loan repayments will outpace our loan production as a result of these factors, making it difficult for us to grow our mortgage loan portfolio and balance sheet.\nThe Company may need to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses (\"ALLL\") in material amounts. We may experience elevated amounts of net charge-offs.\nOur customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. While we maintain an ALLL to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, losses may exceed the value of the collateral securing the loans and the allowance may not fully cover any excess loss.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. Our ALLL is based on these judgments, as well as historical loss experience and an evaluation of the other risks associated with our loan portfolio, including but not limited to, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio. Federal regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, review our loans and ALLL. If our assumptions and judgments used to determine the ALLL prove to be incorrect, if the value of the collateral securing the loans decreases substantially or if our regulators disagree with our judgments, we may need to increase the ALLL in amounts that exceed our expectations. Material additions to the ALLL would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe recorded an $11.2 million reversal of the provision for loan losses during the year ended September 30, 2015, compared to a $15.4 million reversal for the year ended September 30, 2014. The decrease in the provision for loan losses is in response to improving credit conditions in the loan portfolio. Our non-performing assets amounted to $128.6 million or 0.88% of total assets, at September 30, 2015, compared to $147.3 million, or 1.00% of total assets one year earlier. We had net recoveries of $5.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, compared with $14.4 million of net recoveries for the year ended September 30, 2014. However, we expect our loan loss provision to remain at historically elevated levels until non-performing assets and charge-offs improve further and until national and regional economic conditions show more strength.\nThe Company may be required to increase its ALLL as a result of a proposed change to an accounting standard.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") has announced that they will be releasing a new standard for determining the amount of the ALLL. The new guidance will be effective for public entities beginning on or after December 15, 2018, including interim periods. The FASB expects to publish the final guidance in early 2016. The proposed credit loss model will be a significant change from the standard in place today, as it requires the ALLL to be calculated based on the current expected credit losses rather than losses inherent in the portfolio as of a point in time. Because the new credit model focuses on the life of the loan concept, more data will be required to support ALLL estimates, including that loan portfolios will need to be broken down by origination year. As a result, audit and disclosure requirements will increase. Management has not yet fully evaluated the impact of the proposed standard; Therefore, the potential impact is unknown.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of our business activities.\nThe Bank is subjected to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC, CFPB and by the FDIC. In addition, the Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating the Company. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit our stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including laws and regulations governing consumer credit, and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws), but also capital adequacy, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. As part of this regulatory structure, we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Under this structure the OCC, the FDIC, the CFPB and the Federal Reserve have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine,\namong other things, that our operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations also could result in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders. In addition, the OCC has specific authority to take \u201cprompt corrective action,\u201d depending on the Bank's capital level. Currently, we are considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for prompt corrective action purposes. If we were designated by the OCC as \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d our ability to take brokered deposits would become limited. If we were to be designated by the OCC in one of the lower capital levels \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d, we would be required to raise additional capital and would be subject to progressively more severe restrictions on our operations, management and capital distributions, and replacement of senior executive officers and directors. If we became \u201ccritically undercapitalized,\u201d we would also be subject to the appointment of a conservator or receiver.\nRecent legislation and regulatory initiatives to support the financial services industry have been coupled with numerous restrictions and requirements that could detrimentally affect the Company's business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is having a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a framework through which regulatory reform is being written. Many of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented and others are still being drafted. As a result, the impact of the future regulatory requirements continues to be uncertain.\nRecent legislative, both state and national, initiatives to support housing finance could detrimentally affect the Company's business.\nLegislative initiatives could detrimentally impact the Company in the future. The extent of the impact of any such legislation will be dependent on the specific details of the final legislation passed, if any.\nThe Company faces strong competition from other financial institutions and new market participants, offering services similar to those offered by us.\nMany competitors offer the types of loans and deposit services that the Company offers. These competitors include other national banks, savings associations, community banks, credit unions and other financial intermediaries. In particular, the Company's competitors include national banks and major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible for other non-traditional competitors to enter the marketplace and compete for traditional banking services. Increased competition within the Company's market area may result in reduced loan originations and deposits. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete with full success against current and future competitors.\nOur deposit insurance premiums could increase further in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our future earnings and financial condition.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (\"DIF\") at a specific level. The Bank's FDIC insurance premiums increased substantially beginning in 2009, and we expect to pay significant premiums in the future. Unfavorable economic conditions, increased bank failures and additional failures decreased the DIF. In order to restore the DIF to its statutorily mandated minimum of 1.35% of total deposits by September 30, 2020, the FDIC may need to increase deposit insurance premium rates. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are responsible for funding this increase. The FDIC has issued regulations to implement these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. It has, in addition, established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal which goes beyond what is required by statute. There is no implementation deadline for the 2% ratio. The FDIC may increase the assessment rates or impose additional special assessments in the future to keep the DIF at the statutory target level. Any increase in our FDIC premiums could have an adverse effect on the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-Compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act Community Reinvestment Act, Fair lending laws, Flood Insurance Reform Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, and curtail expansion opportunities.\nFinancial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking\nto open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with these regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the U.S. Government imposed and will continue to expand laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities that create significant new compliance burdens and financial risks. We have developed policies and we continue to augment procedures and systems designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to a variety of operational risks, including legal and compliance risk, fraud and theft risk and the risk of operational errors, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are from time to time subject to claims and proceedings related to our operations. These claims and legal actions, which could include supervisory or enforcement actions by our regulators, or criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities, could involve large monetary claims, including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities, and significant defense costs. To mitigate the cost of some of these claims, we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations.\nBoth internal and external fraud and theft are risks. If personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or if such information were to be intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.\nOperational errors include clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Because of our large transaction volume and our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process these transactions there is a risk that technical flaws or tampering or manipulation of those automated systems arising from events wholly or partially beyond our control may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are exposed to the risk that our business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability to operate our business, additional costs to correct defects, potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to stockholders of our common stock. For instance, exercise of the warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with our participation in the Capital Purchase Program diluted the value of our common shares. Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 81577, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WAFD"}
