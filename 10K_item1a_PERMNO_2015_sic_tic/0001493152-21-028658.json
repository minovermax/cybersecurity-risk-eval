{"cik": "1353970", "company": "China XD Plastics Co Ltd", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, readers should carefully consider the following important factors. These factors, among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our financial condition and results of operations and could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements that appear in this on Form 10-K or that we have made or will make elsewhere.\nThe global economic uncertainty could further impair the automotive industry thereby limiting demand for our products.\nThe continuation or intensification of the recent global economic uncertainty arising from the Brexit crisis, the worldwide disruption and negative impact on the macro-economic environment caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 and the economic slowdown in Asia may adversely impact our business and the businesses of our customers. Our specialized plastics are sold to automobile parts manufacturers and distributors. The recent global economic uncertainty has harmed most industries and is detrimental to the automotive industry. Since virtually all of our sales are made to auto industry participants, our sales and business operations are dependent on the financial health of the automotive industry and could suffer if our customers experience, or continue to experience, a downturn in their business. Presently, it is unclear whether and to what extent the economic stimulus measures facilitated by the European Union and other governments throughout the world will mitigate the effects of the crisis on the automotive industry and other industries that affect our business.\nWe concentrate our operations primarily in the automotive industry; therefore, the fluctuations in automotive sales and production could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity.\nWe develop, manufacture, and distribute modified plastic, primarily for use in automobiles. Automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and depend, among other things, on general economic conditions and consumer spending and preferences (which can be affected by a number of issues including fuel costs and the availability of consumer financing). As the volume of automotive production fluctuates, the demand for our products also fluctuates. According to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, for the year ended December 31, 2019, automobile production and sales in China decreased by 7.5% and 8.2%, respectively as compared to the same period of 2018. A weakening in macroeconomic conditions since summer of 2018 has deteriorated business conditions. There can be no assurance that the market conditions, government policies and other factors will help the growth rate in the future. Any contraction in automotive sales and production will harm our results of operations and financial condition. Consequently, we are exposed to the risks of adverse developments affecting the auto industry to a greater extent than if our operations were dispersed over a variety of industries.\nOur financial performance may be affected by the prospects of our Dubai facility and the associated expansion into Middle East, Europe and other parts of Asia.\nIn 2014, we embarked our entry into the international market by primarily marketing long carbon chain PA plastic alloy and high-performance modified PA66 products. After a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, we have established business relationships with new customers in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia. We have experienced a delay in cash collection from a major customer in UAE. As of December 31, 2019, we provided an allowance of US$62.8 million for the overdue accounts receivable from the major customer in UAE, as the customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended repayment plan.\nThe Company has been putting efforts into ramping up its production. In addition to the 10 trial production lines at Dubai Xinda, the Company completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity at the end of November 2018, and an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity are under construction. The Company estimates 22 production lines will be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, 8 production lines will be put into production in the second quarter of 2022, bringing total installed production capacity at Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end products for the overseas market. If we are unable to expand our Dubai facility and the associated expansion in other areas, our financial performance may be affected.\nThe occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe currently operate a substantial portion of our manufacturing facilities in China, and our corporate headquarters are located at Harbin, Heilongjiang Province in China. Since January 2020, the rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in increased travel restrictions and disruption and shutdown of businesses in China. In early 2020, we temporarily closed our manufacturing facilities and corporate offices in accordance with the requirement of the Chinese government, and requested our employees to work remotely. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected by the disruption of our business and limited access to our manufacturing facilities caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 in the PRC.\nThe overall impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on our operations and financial results for the year of 2020 remains to be seen. Currently, given the effective COVID-19 containment measures implemented in China, approximately 50% of employees of our administrative offices had returned to work by the end of March 2020 and 90% returned to work by end of April. Our factories in Heilongjiang and Sichuan provinces were running at 20% capacity utilization at the end of March, and approximately around 70% capacity utilization by the end of April, and normal utilization rate by the end of May 2020. Our factory in Dubai was not impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 during January and February but only 20% employees from private sectors are now allowed to go to work due to the recent rise of COVID-19 cases in UAE.\nWe may further experience impacts from quarantines, market downturns and changes in customer behavior related to fears of the pandemic if the coronavirus becomes widespread in any of our markets. Furthermore, if the coronavirus were to affect a significant number of our workforce employed in our manufacturing facilities or corporate offices, we may experience delays or the inability to develop, produce and deliver our products on a timely basis. In addition, one or more of our customers, distributors, service providers or suppliers may experience financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their businesses due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which may in turn adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other health epidemic may affect our business and operations will depend on future developments, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by governments and private businesses to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, among others, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this moment. As a result, the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe withdrawal of preferential government policies and the tightening control over the Chinese automotive industry and automobile purchase restrictions imposed in certain major cities may limit market demand for our products.\nIn 2011, Chinese government terminated two preferential policies for its automotive industry: (1) vehicles with 1.6L or lower air displacement were given a 50% discount in purchase tax and (2) vehicles sold in rural area were given a government subsidy. Since 2011, in order to resolve the extreme traffic congestion, the Beijing government has been implementing the vehicle purchase quota policy, which limits the maximum vehicles sold in Beijing per month to 20,000. Other cities which have begun to show signs of traffic congestion have also begun to implement similar measures to control traffic congestion, including the limited automobile licenses policy implemented in Shanghai and Tianjin and the imposition of congestion charges in Shenzhen. The termination of two nation-wide preferential policies negatively affected consumer demand for new vehicles, and local restrictive measures over automobile purchases in major cities has resulted in slower growth of sales for many years prior to the reintroduction of the preferential policies in September 2015. The national and local policies over the Chinese automotive industry may continue to impact market demand for automobiles in 2019 and any future withdrawal of preferential government policies and the further tightening of control and restrictions may eventually result in a reduction in our product sales.\nThe Chinese automotive industry\u2019s growth is slowing after the rapid growth since 2000 and such slowdown may adversely affect the market demand for our products.\nThere is a direct correlation between our business and automobile production volume and sales, which are dependent on economic policies and market sentiment. The Chinese automotive industry had been rapidly growing for a decade prior to 2011. However, inflation, higher interest rates, tighter bank lending, lifting of consumer subsidies and buying restrictions in congested cities all contributed to a more modest environment since 2011. In order to stimulate the growth of the auto industry, on September 29, 2015, the Chinese government implemented a tax incentive policy of 50% reduction of the sales tax for eligible purchase of vehicles with engines of 1.6 liters and less. This helped the recovery of vehicle sales in China since the fourth quarter of 2015 and automobile sales volume growth rate reached to 13.7% in 2016. However, following the automobile sales in China with a lower growth rate of 3.0% in 2017, Chinese government suspended the above tax incentive policy and resumed vehicle purchase tax at a statutory rate of 10% effective from January 1, 2018. Furthermore, since summer of 2018, Chinese macroeconomic conditions signaled weakening and deteriorated business conditions, automobile production and sales in China further decreased by 7.5% and 8.2%, respectively, for twelve months of 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. In March 2019, the Chinese government decided to reduce the financial subsidy policy for the promotion and application of New Energy Vehicles with subsidies fallen more than 50%. There can be no assurance that the market conditions, government policies and other factors leading to the current growth in demand for automobiles continue. Any significant decline in demand for automobiles would directly and adversely affect demand for our products and hence our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA large percentage of our sales revenue is derived from sales to a limited number of distributors and a limited number of customers, and our business will suffer if sales to these customers decline.\nIn 2014, we embarked our entry into the international market by primarily marketing long carbon chain PA plastic alloy and high-performance modified PA66 products. After a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, we have established business relationships with new customers in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia. We have experienced a delay in cash collection from a major customer in UAE. As of December 31, 2020, we provided an allowance of US$62.8 million for the overdue accounts receivable from the major customer in UAE, as the customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended repayment plan.\nWe may not be able to manage our business expansion effectively, which could harm our business.\nWe have expanded rapidly by making substantial investments in new markets and geographic regions. For example, on March 17, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with People\u2019s Government of Shunqing District, Nanchong City of Sichuan Province for the production of 300,000 metric tons of bio-composite materials and additive manufacturing and 20,000 metric tons of functional masterbatch, a high-end color additive process in plastics manufacturing. On July 21, 2017, HLJ Xinda Group entered into three investment agreements with the Management Committee of Harbin Economic- Technological Development Zone with respect to the industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, the industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics and the industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory. We anticipate continuous expansion in our business by entering into new markets serving different industries and geographic regions. Such business expansion requires significant local management resources and personnel, knowledges and expertise in new markets and geographies and building relationship with local suppliers and clients. In order to manage the planned business expansion, we will be required to expand, train and manage our growing employee base. Furthermore, our management will be required to learn new markets and geographies and build relationship with local suppliers and clients. We cannot assure you that our current resources, knowledges and business relationships will be adequate to support our current expansion plans. If we are not successful in expanding our personnel, acquiring knowledge and expertise in the new markets and geographies and building relationship with local suppliers and clients, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers. While we have identified alternative sources for the materials and equipment we use, a temporary disruption in our ability to procure necessary materials and equipment could adversely impact our sales in future periods.\nMaterials constitute a substantial part of the cost of our products. We seek to reduce the cost of raw materials by dealing with major suppliers. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased approximately 14.7% of our raw materials from one major supplier. We believe the relationship with our suppliers is satisfactory and that alternative suppliers are available if relationships falter or existing suppliers should become unable to keep up with our requirements. However, there can be no assurance that our current or future suppliers will be able to meet our requirements on commercially reasonable terms or within scheduled delivery times. An interruption of our arrangements with suppliers could cause a delay in the production of our products for timely delivery to distributors and customers, which could result in a loss of sales in future periods.\nIf we are subject to product quality or liability claims relating to our products, we may incur significant litigation expenses and management may have to devote significant time defending such claims, which if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay significant damage awards.\nAlthough we have adopted certain internal measures to supervise and examine the quality of our products, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to our product quality. Consistent with rapid growth and expansion in many businesses, there are risks associated with quality of newly developed products, especially during the initial stage and time and efforts needed to improve our technology and techniques in order to supply quality and batch consistency to our new customers, in particular, high-end products to overseas customers. The defense of these proceedings and claims could be both costly and time-consuming and significantly divert the efforts and resources of our management. An adverse determination in any such proceedings could subject us to significant liability. In addition, any such proceeding, even if ultimately determined in our favor, could damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing sales and market share. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase of our products.\nWe have limited insurance coverage on our assets in China and any uninsured loss or damage to our property, business disruption or litigation may result in our incurring substantial costs and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nThe insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. Insurance companies in China offer limited insurance products. Other than automobile insurance on certain vehicles and property and casualty insurance for some of our assets such as factories and equipment we do not have insurance coverage on our other assets or inventories, nor do we have any business interruption, product liability or litigation insurance for our operations in China. We have determined that the costs of insuring for these risks and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. Any uninsured loss or damage to property, business disruption or litigation may result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of our resources, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nSAFE regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC individuals may increase our administrative burden and restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activity. If our shareholders and beneficial owners who are PRC individuals fail to make any required applications, registrations and filings under such regulations, we may be unable to distribute profits or become subject to liability under PRC laws, and our ability to compensate our staff through equity compensation may be hindered and business operation may be adversely affected.\nThe State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d), has promulgated several regulations, including the Circular on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Resident\u2019s Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 37, in July 2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating to any change of basic information (including change of such PRC citizens or residents, name and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions. SAFE Circular 37 is issued to replace the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents Engaging in Financing and Roundtrip Investments via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 75.\nWe have requested our shareholders and beneficial owners who are PRC residents to make the necessary applications and filings as required under these regulations and under any implementation rules or approval practices that may be established under these regulations. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Mr. Han, our Chief Executive Officer, has registered his beneficial ownerships in China XD and XD Engineering Plastics Company Limited (\u201cXD Engineering Plastics\u201d) respectively with local SAFE in accordance with Circular No. 37. However, we cannot assure you that the rest of our shareholders and beneficial owners who are PRC individuals have timely updated their registrations with SAFE in accordance with SAFE regulations. The failure or inability of our PRC shareholders and beneficial owners make any required registrations may subject us to fines and legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, as a result of which our acquisition strategy and business operations and our ability to distribute profits to you could be materially and adversely affected.\nOn December 25, 2006, the People\u2019s Bank of China issued the Administration Measures of Foreign Exchange Matters for Individuals, which set forth the respective requirements for foreign exchange transactions by individuals (both PRC and non-PRC citizens) under the current account or the capital account, and the corresponding Implementing Rules were issued by SAFE on January 5, 2007, both of these regulations became effective on February 1, 2007. According to these regulations, all foreign exchange matters relating to employee stock holding plans, share option plans or similar plans of an overseas publicly-listed company in which PRC citizens will participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch.\nIn February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notice on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly-Listed Company, or the New Stock Option Rules, which replaced and substituted the Application Procedure of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Holding Plan or Stock Option Plan of Overseas-Listed Company, or the Stock Option Rule. According to the New Stock Option Rules, if a PRC resident participates in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly-listed company, a qualified PRC domestic agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly-listed company or another qualified institution selected by such PRC subsidiary, among other things, must file on behalf of such participant an application with SAFE to conduct the SAFE registration with respect to such stock incentive plan and obtain approval for an annual allowance with respect to the purchase of foreign exchange in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options or stock such participant holds. Such participants must also retain an overseas entrusted institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of stock options, the purchase and sale of corresponding stocks or interests and fund transfers. In addition, the qualified PRC domestic agent is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect to the stock incentive plan if there is any material change to the stock incentive plan, the qualified PRC domestic agent or the overseas entrusted institution or other material changes. Such participant\u2019s foreign exchange income received from the sale of stock and dividends distributed by the overseas publicly-listed company must be fully remitted into a specific domestic foreign currency account opened and managed by such qualified PRC domestic agent first, before distribution to such participants.\nWe are an offshore listed company and, as a result, any Chinese employee or foreign employee of our PRC subsidiaries, who resides in PRC more than one year consecutively, including without limitation, directors, supervisors and other senior management staffs of our PRC subsidiaries, who have been granted share options or shares under our existing share incentive plan, are subject to the New Stock Option Rules. We completed the application with local SAFE in Heilongjiang on December 16, 2013, obtaining a registration in respect of our 2009 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan in accordance with the New Stock Option Rules and are in the process of applying relevant registration for our 2020 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan. If our PRC subsidiaries or their qualified employees fail to comply with these regulations, including the New Stock Option Rules, they may be subject to fines or other legal sanctions imposed by SAFE or other Chinese government authorities. In that case, our ability to compensate our employees, directors, supervisors and other senior management staffs through equity compensations may be hindered and our business operations may be adversely affected.\nUnder the PRC EIT Law, we and/or Favor Sea (BVI) may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of the PRC. Such classification could result in tax consequences to us, our non-PRC resident shareholders and Favor Sea (BVI).\nOn March 16, 2007, the National People\u2019s Congress approved and promulgated the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (\u201cEIT Law\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, enterprises are classified as resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. An enterprise established outside of China with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within China is considered a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d and subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on global income. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d as a managing body that in practice exercises \u201csubstantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties\u201d of the enterprise; however, due to the short history of the EIT Law and lack of applicable legal precedents, it remains unclear whether the PRC tax authorities would deem our managing body as being located within China, or whether we or our non-PRC subsidiaries would be deemed as resident enterprises of the PRC.\nIf the PRC tax authorities determine that we, Favor Sea Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation (\u201cFavor Sea (BVI)\u201d) and/or Xinda Holding (HK) Company Limited, a Hong Kong corporation (\u201cXinda HK\u201d), are \u201cresident enterprises\u201d for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of PRC tax consequences could follow. We, Favor Sea (BVI) and/or Xinda HK may be subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our, Favor Sea (BVI)\u2019s and/or Xinda HK\u2019s worldwide taxable income, as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. However, under the EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividends paid between \u201cqualified resident enterprises\u201d are exempt from enterprise income tax. As a result, if we, Favor Sea (BVI) and Xinda HK are treated as PRC \u201cqualified resident enterprises,\u201d all dividends paid from HLJ Xinda Group to Xinda HK, from Xinda HK to Favor Sea (BVI) and from Favor Sea (BVI) to us may be exempt from PRC tax. Otherwise, all dividends paid from HLJ Xinda Group to Xinda HK, from Xinda HK to Favor Sea (BVI) and from Favor Sea (BVI) to us may be subject to withholding tax under the EIT Law and its implementing rules.\nOn April 22, 2009, State Administration of Taxation (\u201cSAT\u201d) enacted \u201cCircular of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Identification of Chinese-Controlled Overseas Registered Enterprises as Resident Enterprises in Accordance With the Actual Standards of Organizational Management\u201d. On July 27, 2011, SAT enacted \u201cAnnouncement of the State Administration of Taxation on Printing and Distributing the Administrative Measures for Income Tax on Chinese-controlled Resident Enterprises Incorporated Overseas (Trial Implementation)\u201d. Under those two rules, either the enterprises may request the PRC tax authorities to determine their \u201cresident enterprises\u201d identity or the tax authority may investigate and determine an enterprise\u2019s identity. The target enterprises under those two rules are foreign registered companies controlled by the PRC companies, however, the PRC tax authority may determine if a foreign registered company controlled by the PRC individual(s) is a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d or not by reference to those two rules.\nUnder the EIT Law and its implementation rules, dividends payable by a foreign-invested enterprise in China to its shareholders that are \u201cnon-resident enterprises\u201d are subject to a 10% withholding tax, unless such shareholders\u2019 jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a preferential arrangement. Pursuant to the Notice of the SAT on Issuing the Table of Tax Rates on Dividends in Treatises, or Notice 112, which was issued on January 29, 2008, the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, or the Double Taxation Arrangement (Hong Kong), which became effective on December 8, 2006, such withholding tax may be lowered to 5% if the PRC enterprise is at least 25% directly held by a Hong Kong enterprise. In October 2009, the SAT further issued the Notice on How to Understand and Determine the \u201cBeneficial Owners\u201d in Tax Treaties, or Circular 601. According to Circular 601, non-resident enterprises that cannot provide valid supporting documents as \u201cbeneficial owners\u201d may not be approved to enjoy tax treaty benefits, and \u201cbeneficial owners\u201d refer to individuals, companies or other organizations which are normally engaged in substantive operations. These rules also set forth certain adverse factors on the recognition of a \u201cbeneficial owner.\u201d Specifically, they expressly exclude a \u201cconduit company\u201d that is usually established for the purposes of avoiding or reducing tax obligations or transferring or accumulating profits and not engaged in substantive operations such as manufacturing, sales or management, from being a \u201cbeneficial owner.\u201d As a result, if we are treated as PRC \u201cnon-resident enterprises\u201d under the EIT Law, then dividends from HLJ Xinda Group (assuming such dividends were considered sourced within the PRC) paid to us through Xinda HK may be subject to a reduced withholding tax at a rate of 5% if Xinda HK is determined to be Hong Kong tax residents and are considered to be \u201cbeneficial owners\u201d that are generally engaged in substantive business activities and entitled to treaty benefits under the Double Taxation Arrangement (Hong Kong). Otherwise, we may not be able to enjoy the preferential withholding tax rate of 5% under the tax arrangement and therefore be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10% with respect to dividends to be paid by HLJ Xinda Group (assuming such dividends were considered sourced within the PRC) to us through Xinda HK. Any such taxes on dividends could materially reduce the amount of dividends, if any, we could pay to our shareholders.\nHowever, if we are deemed as a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d the new \u201cresident enterprise\u201d classification could result in a situation in which an up to 10% PRC tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders that are not PRC tax \u201cresident enterprises\u201d. In such event, we may be required to withhold an up to 10% PRC tax on any dividends paid to non-PRC resident enterprise shareholders. Our non-PRC resident enterprise shareholders also may be responsible for paying PRC tax at a rate of 10% on any gain realized from the sale or transfer of our ordinary shares in certain circumstances if such income is considered PRC-sourced income by relevant tax authorities. We would not, however, have an obligation to withhold PRC tax with respect to such gain.\nWe (or a foreign investor) may become at risk of being taxed or imposed a penalty under Announcement 7 and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Announcement 7 or to establish that we (or such foreign investor) should not be taxed under Announcement 7, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations (or such foreign investor\u2019s investment in us).\nOn December 15, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation (\u201cSAT\u201d) released the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises (\u201cCircular 698\u201d) that reinforces the taxation of non-listed equity transfers by non-resident enterprises through overseas holding vehicles. Circular 698 is retroactively effective from January 1, 2008. Subsequently SAT also released the Announcement on Several Issues Related to Enterprise Income Tax for Indirect Asset Transfer by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises (\u201cAnnouncement 7\u201d), effective from February 3, 2015, which in part supersedes Circular 698.\nAnnouncement 7 addresses indirect share transfer as well as other issues. According to Announcement 7, if a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of or similar rights or interests in overseas companies which directly or indirectly own PRC taxable assets through an arrangement without a reasonable commercial purpose, but rather to avoid PRC corporate income tax, the transaction will be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets subject to PRC corporate income tax. Announcement 7 specifies certain factors that should be considered in determining whether an indirect transfer has a reasonable commercial purpose. Since Announcement 7 has a short history, there is uncertainty as to its application and in particular, the interpretation of the term \u201creasonable commercial purpose.\u201d\nAnnouncement 7 further provides that, the entity which has the obligation to pay the consideration for the transfer to the transferring shareholders has the obligation to withhold any PRC corporate income tax that is due. If the transferring shareholders do not pay corporate income tax that is due for a transfer and the entity which has the obligation to pay the consideration does not withhold the tax due, the PRC tax authorities may impose a penalty on the entity that so fails to withhold, which may be relieved or exempted from the withholding obligation and any resulting penalty under certain circumstances if it reports such transfer to the PRC tax authorities.\nPRC regulations relating to mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors may increase the administrative burden we face and create regulatory uncertainties.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, namely, the PRC Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or SASAC, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, and SAFE, jointly adopted the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rule, which became effective on September 8, 2006. The M&A Rule purports, among other things, (i) to require any PRC company, enterprise or individual that intends to merge or acquire its domestic affiliated company in the name of an overseas company which it lawfully established or controls, to apply for MOFCOM\u2019s examination on and approval for the proposed merger or acquisition; and (ii) to require SPVs, formed for overseas listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals, to obtain the approval of CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforcement of these rules, and CSRC has yet to promulgate any written provisions or formally to declare or state whether the overseas listing of a PRC-related company structured similar to ours is subject to the approval of CSRC. As a result, we are not sure whether the M&A Rule would require us or our entities in China to obtain the approval from either MOFCOM or CSRC or any other regulatory agencies in connection with the transaction contemplated by the share transfer contracts which were entered into between Mr. Jie Han, Mr. Qingwei Ma and Xinda Holding (HK) Company Limited on June 26, 2008, the transaction contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into by and among NB Telecom, Favor Sea (BVI) and the shareholders of Favor Sea (BVI) on December 24, 2008 (detailed description of both of the two aforesaid transactions and relevant contracts can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, filed on April 14, 2010) the adoption and performance of the option agreement dated May 16, 2008 between Ms. Piao and Mr. Han.\nFurther, in the event MOFCOM or CSRC deems it necessary for us to obtain its approval prior to our entry into the aforesaid agreements, we could be subject to severe penalties. The M&A Rule does not stipulate the specific penalty terms, therefore, we are unable to determine what penalties we may face, and how such penalties may affect our business operations or future strategy.\nOur business will suffer if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits or approvals.\nUnder PRC laws, we are required to obtain from various PRC governmental authorities certain permits and licenses in relation to the operation of our business. These permits and licenses are subject to periodic renewal and/or reassessment by the relevant PRC government authorities and the standards of compliance required in relation thereto may from time to time be subject to change. We cannot assure you that we can always obtain, maintain or renew all the permits and licenses in a timely manner. Additionally, any changes in compliance standards, or any new laws or regulations that may prohibit or render it more restrictive for us to conduct our business or increase our compliance costs may adversely affect our operations or profitability. Any failure by us to obtain, maintain or renew necessary licenses, permits and approvals, could subject us to fines and other penalties and limit the business we could conduct, which could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business. In addition, we may not be able to carry on business without such permits and licenses being renewed and/or reassessed.\nPursuant to PRC laws and regulations, construction or expansion of a building or a production facility is subject to various permits and approvals from different government authorities. In connection with the construction of HLJ Xinda Group\u2019s factory and production facilities, which has already been completed and put into operation, we obtained a project approval from Administration Committee of Harbin Economic and Technological & High-tech Development Zone and an approval for the environmental impact assessment report on the construction project of HLJ Xinda Group in 2003. In connection with the construction of Sichuan Xinda Group\u2019s factory and production facilities which has been partially completed in the second half of 2016, we obtained the project approvals from Bureau of Development and Reform of Shunqing District, Nanchong City in 2013 and 2015, respectively. In connection with the Phase II construction of AL Composites which has been completed by the middle of 2016, we obtained the project approval from Engineering & Project Management Department, UAE region Economic Zones World (\u201cEZW\u201d) in June 2015, and the building permit from Department of Planning & Development, Ports, Customs & Free Zone Corporation, Government of Dubai in September 2015. In July 2017, HLJ Xinda Group launched new industrial development project with the Management Committee of Harbin Economic - Technological Development Zone for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics and building 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory. On December 21, 2017 and February 7, 2018, we got building and planning permit from Harbin Municipal Urban and Rural Bureau, respectively. Failure to obtain all necessary approvals/permits may subject us to various penalties, such as fines or being required to vacate from the facilities where we currently operate our business.\nIncreased environmental regulation in China could increase our costs of operation.\nCertain processes utilized in the production of modified plastics result in toxic by-products. To date, the Chinese government has imposed only limited regulation on the production of these by-products, and enforcement of the regulations has been sparse. Recently, however, there is a substantial increase in focus on the Chinese environment, which has inspired considerable new regulation. Because we plan to export plastics to the U.S. and Europe in coming years, we have developed certain safeguards in our manufacturing processes to assure compliance with the environmental protection standard ISO/TS16949 Quality Assurance Standard, the European Union\u2019s RoHS Standards and Germany\u2019s PAHs Standards. Furthermore, have applied for the U.S.\u2019s UL Safety Certification, ISO14001 Environmental Management System Certification and OHSAS18001 Occupational Health Management System Certification This compliance regimen brings us into compliance with all Chinese environmental regulations. Additional regulation, however, could increase our cost of doing business, which would impair our profitability.\nRecent joint statement by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or the PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the newly enacted Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainties to the trading of our common stock on U.S. stock exchanges, including the possibility that our securities can be delisted if the PCAOB cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor.\nOn April 21, 2020, the SEC Chairman and PCAOB Chairman, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the risks associated with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in emerging markets including China. The joint statement emphasized the risks associated with lack of access for the PCAOB to inspect auditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks of fraud in emerging markets.\nOn May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed three proposals with the SEC to (1) apply minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating in \u201cRestrictive Market,\u201d (2) adopt a new requirement relating to the qualification of management or board of director for Restrictive Market companies, and (3) apply additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications of the company\u2019s auditor.\nOn June 4, 2020, the U.S. President issued a memorandum ordering the President\u2019s working group on financial markets to submit a report to the President within 60 days of the date of the memorandum that should include recommendations for actions that can be taken by the executive branch and by the SEC or PCAOB to enforce U.S. regulatory requirements on Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges and their audit firms. However, it remains unclear what further actions, if any, the U.S. executive branch, the SEC, and PCAOB will take to address the problem.\nOn August 6, 2020, the President\u2019s working group released a report recommending that the SEC take steps to implement the five recommendations outlined in the report. In particular, to address companies from jurisdictions that do not provide the PCAOB with sufficient access to fulfill its statutory mandate, the President\u2019s working group recommended enhanced listing standards on U.S. stock exchanges. This would require, as a condition to initial and continued exchange listing, PCAOB access to work papers of the principal audit firm for the audit of the listed company. Companies unable to satisfy this standard as a result of governmental restrictions on access to audit work papers and practices in their jurisdiction may satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an audit firm with comparable resources and experience where the PCAOB determines it has sufficient access to audit work papers and practices to conduct an appropriate inspection of the co-audit firm. The report permits the new listing standards to provide for a transition period until January 1, 2022 for listed companies, but would apply immediately to new listings once the necessary rulemakings and/or standard-setting are effective.\nOn August 10, 2020, the SEC announced that the SEC Chairman had directed the SEC staff to prepare proposals in response to the report of the President\u2019s working group, and that the SEC was soliciting public comments and information with respect to the development of these proposals.\nOn May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the Act. The Act was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on December 2, 2020. On December 18, 2020, the Act was signed into public law by the President of the United States. In essence, the Act requires the SEC to prohibit foreign companies from listing securities on U.S. securities exchanges if a company retains a foreign accounting firm that cannot be inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years, beginning in 2021. On March 24, 2021, the SEC announced that it had adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure requirements of the Act. The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report on Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction.\nThe enactment of the Act and any additional actions, proceedings, or new rules resulting from these efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information could cause investors uncertainty for affected issuers and the price of our shares could be adversely affected, and we could face regulatory sanctions if we and our auditor are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement.\nThe lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of the auditors based in China. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firm\u2019s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections.\nOur auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States, pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Our auditor is headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis with the last inspection in 2019 with inspection report available in November 2021. However, the recent developments would add uncertainties to the trading of our shares on U.S. stock exchanges, including the possibility that our securities can be delisted if the PCAOB cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor, and we cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach, or experience as it relates to our audit.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in China. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that is located in China where substantially all of our operations and business are located has conducted any due diligence on our operations or reviewed or cleared any of our disclosure.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Unlike public reporting companies whose operations are located primarily in the United States, however, substantially all of our operations are located in China. Since substantially all of our operations and business takes place in China, it may be more difficult for the Staff of the SEC to overcome the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present when reviewing our disclosure. These same obstacles are not present for similar companies whose operations or business take place entirely or primarily in the United States. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other disclosure and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review of the CSRC, a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on our company and with the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements has been reviewed or otherwise scrutinized by any local regulator.\nOur former independent registered public accounting firm may be temporarily suspended from practicing before the SEC if unable to continue to satisfy SEC investigation requests in the future. If a delay in completion of our audit process occurs as a result, we could be unable to timely file certain reports with the SEC, which may lead to the delisting of our stock.\nThe vast majority of our sales are to customers in China, and we have all of our operations in China. Like many U.S. companies with significant operations in China, our former independent registered public accounting firm is located in China.\nOn January 22, 2014, Judge Cameron Elliot, an SEC administrative law judge, issued an initial decision suspending the Chinese member firms of the \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms, including our former independent registered public accounting firm, from practicing before the SEC for six months. In February 2014, the initial decision was appealed. While under appeal and in February 2015, the Chinese member firms of \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms reached a settlement with the SEC. As part of the settlement, each of the Chinese member firms of \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms agreed to settlement terms that include a censure, undertakings to make a payment to the SEC, procedures and undertakings as to future requests for documents by the SEC, and possible additional proceedings and remedies should those undertakings not be adhered to.\nIf the settlement terms are not adhered to, Chinese member firms of \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms may be suspended from practicing before the SEC which could in turn delay the timely filing of our financial statements with the SEC. Although we have engaged another qualified independent auditor to replace our former independent registered public accounting firm, any delay in such transition could cause a delinquency in our filings with the SEC and may result in NASDAQ initiating procedures, which could adversely harm our reputation and have other material adverse effects on our overall growth and prospects.\nWe may fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in the integrity of our financial reports, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nPrior to our listing on the US stock exchange, we were a private company with all business operations within China. Our accounting and reporting system was designed to satisfy local statutory requirements and internal management needs. Since we became a public company, our business has grown significantly over the years. Management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of December 31, 2020, due to one material weakness which relates to the lack of sufficient accounting and financial reporting personnel to formalize certain key controls over the financial reporting process and report financial information based on US GAAP and SEC reporting requirements.\nOur management is committed to strengthening our internal controls and complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX 404\u201d). Since 2014, when we were required to comply with SOX 404, our efforts to improve our internal control over financial reporting include: (1) our accounting staff obtained external training of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting by qualified entities, (2) having hired two third-party SOX 404 compliance consultants to help us improve our internal control system, (3) continuing to seek senior qualified people with requisite expertise and knowledge to help improve our internal control procedures, (4) having adopted internal policies and approval and supervision procedures governing financial reporting, (5) having adopted procedures to evaluate and assess performance of directors, officers and employees of the Company, and (6) continuing to hold internal meetings, discussions and seminars periodically to review and improve our internal control procedures.\nHowever, we cannot be certain that these measures we have undertaken will ensure that we will develop and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Furthermore, if we are able to rapidly grow our business, the internal controls that we will need may become more complex, and significantly more resources may be required to ensure our internal controls remain effective. Failure to implement required controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we fail to develop and maintain an effective internal control system, our stockholders and other potential investors may lose confidence in our business operations and the integrity of our financial statements, and may be discouraged from future investments in our company, which may delay or hinder any future business development or expansion plans if we are unable to raise funds in future financings, and our current stockholders may choose to dispose of the shares of common stock they own in our company, which could have a negative impact on our stock price. In addition, non-compliance with SOX 404 could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including the suspension of trading of our stock on the NASDAQ Global Market, ineligibility for listing on other national securities exchanges, and the inability of registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock, which could further reduce our stock price.\nWe may be subject to or be liable for U.S. taxes, interest and penalties.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company\u2019s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings.\nThe Company recorded a charge of approximately $71.0 million for the tax on deemed repatriation to the United States based on accumulated earnings in the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company finalized the calculations and tax positions used in the analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in consideration of proposed regulations and other guidance issued during 2018, and no adjustment was made to the provisional amount. The charge for deemed repatriation was payable by the Company over an eight-year period commencing April 2018.\nAs of December 31, 20120 for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company owed U.S. federal income taxes of US$6,407 other than the above repatriation tax. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) will not assess additional U.S. federal income taxes, interest and penalties on us.\nOur inability or failure to protect our intellectual property rights may significantly and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProtection of our proprietary processes, methods and other technology is important to our business. We generally rely on a combination of the patent, trademark and copyright laws of the PRC and laws protecting trade secret in the PRC, as well as licenses and non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. The patent, trademark and copyright laws of the PRC, as well as laws protecting trade secret in the PRC, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies. Additionally, some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and, even if a patent application has been filed, it may not result in an issued patent. If patents are issued to us, those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. In addition, upon the expiration of patents issued to us, we will be unable to prevent our competitors from using or introducing products using the formerly-patented technology. As a result, we may be faced with increased competition and our results of operations may be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable.\nWe also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While we generally enter into confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, we cannot assure you that our confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise.\nOur intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements that are important to our business with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. We could also face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies. If we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others, we may be liable for damages, and we may be required to change our processes, to redesign our products partially or completely, to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product(s) entirely. Even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit, the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits. We may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products.\nWe may be unable to renew the leases for our factories on acceptable terms or these leases may be terminated.\nAs of December 31, 20120 HLJ Xinda Group operated three separate factories located at 9 Qinling Road (the \u201cQinling Road Factory\u201d), 9 North Dalian Road (the \u201cDalian Road Factory\u201d) and 9 Jiangnan First Road (the \u201cJiangnan Road Factory\u201d), respectively. HLJ Xinda Group owns the titles to the land and premises of the Qinling Road Factory. HLJ Xinda Group leases the land and premises of the Dalian Road Factory from Harbin Xinda High-Tech Co., Ltd (\u201cXinda High-Tech\u201d). HLJ Xinda Group is in the process of acquiring the titles to the land and premises at Jiangnan Road Factory. The Company expects the title transfer to be completed by the end of third quarter of 2021. HLJ Xinda Group\u2019s leases was renewed to be expired on December 31, 2020. If we are unable to renew our lease on acceptable terms in due course or acquire the titles to the land and premises at Jiangnan Road Factory or if our lease is terminated by the lessor unilaterally for the Dalian Road Factory:\n\u25cf we may be unable to find a new property with the amenities and in the location we require for our factories, which may result in a factory closure;\n\u25cf we may have to relocate to a less desirable location;\n\u25cf we may have to relocate to a location with facilities that do not meet our requirements;\n\u25cf our factories may experience significant disruption in operations and, as a result, we may be unable to produce products during the period of disruption.\nAny of these events may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to sell our products at current profit margin is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are beyond our control; in particular, we may not be able to reflect raw material cost increases in the price of our products.\nOur ability to sell our products at current profit margin is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are beyond our control. For example, general slow-down in the Chinese or world economy may lessen the demand for our products, and we may be forced to sell our products at a lower price.\nParticularly, we may not be able to pass through raw material cost increases to our customers on a timely basis and reflect such increases in the price of our products. We purchase various plastic resins, which are derived from petroleum or natural gas, to produce our modified plastics products. Cost of raw materials made up a vast majority of our cost of revenues in 2020 and 2019. The market prices of plastic resins may fluctuate due to changes in supply and demand conditions in that industry. Any shortage in supply of or significant increase in demand for plastic resins and additives may result in higher market prices and thereby increase our cost of revenues, and we may not be able to pass on increases in the prices of raw materials to our customers. Under the terms of our distributor agreements, we will only be able to increase the sales prices for our products if the cost of our raw materials increases by more than 5% on a cumulative basis. As a result, we may not be able to adjust our selling prices in a timely manner, and our inability to increase the selling prices of our products sold during the period in which the cumulative increases of the cost of our raw materials is less than 5% may reduce our profitability. Furthermore, other adverse developments such as increased competition may not allow us to pass through cost increases to our distributors at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations and financial condition. When expanding into new regions, we have taken and may continue to take marketing initiatives from time to time to offer sales incentives, including discounts, to increase market share. Such initiatives and measures have put and may continue to put pressure on our margins.\nOur assets are primarily located in China. So any dividends or proceeds from liquidation are subject to the approval of the relevant Chinese government agencies, and you may face difficulties in protecting your interests.\nOur assets are primarily located inside China. Under the laws governing foreign investment entities in China, dividend distribution and liquidation are allowed but subject to respective administrative procedures under the Foreign Investment Law and relevant laws and rules. Any dividend payment will be subject to the decision of the Board of Directors and be subject to foreign exchange rules governing such repatriation. Any liquidation is subject to the decision of the highest authority of the company, the relevant government agency\u2019s approval and supervision (including but not limited to the local branch of MOFCOM), as well as the whole process of liquidation under PRC laws and regulations, including without limitation personnel resettlement, assets disposition, settlement of debts and creditor\u2019s rights as well as deregistration, which process could be very time-consuming and complex. Since the dividend distribution procedure is subject to foreign exchange rules governing such repatriation, risks may arise for our investors when HLJ Xinda Group pays dividend to us through Xinda HK. Furthermore, the liquidation procedure is a complex and time consuming procedures subject to government approvals, additional risks and costs may arise for our investors in the process.\nIn addition, we conduct substantially all of our business operations in China, and substantially all of our directors and senior management are based in China. The SEC, U.S. Department of Justice and other authorities often have substantial difficulties in bringing and enforcing actions against non-U.S. companies and non-U.S. persons, including company directors and officers, in certain emerging markets, including China. Additionally, our public shareholders may have limited rights and few practical remedies in emerging markets where we operate, as shareholder claims that are common in the United States, including class action securities law and fraud claims, generally are difficult or impossible to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in many emerging markets, including China.\nAs a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company operated in the United States.\nGovernmental control of currency conversions may affect the value of your investment.\nA majority of our revenue are earned in Renminbi. Any future restrictions on currency conversions may limit our ability to use revenue generated in Renminbi to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the PRC government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the Renminbi for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that foreign-invested enterprises like us may buy, sell or remit foreign currencies only after providing valid commercial documents at a PRC banks specifically authorized to conduct foreign-exchange business.\nIn addition, conversion of Renminbi for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to governmental approval in the PRC, and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign-exchange accounts for capital account items. There is no guarantee that PRC regulatory authorities will not impose additional restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi. Such restrictions could prevent us from distributing dividends and thereby reduce the value of our stock.\nThe fluctuation of the exchange rate of the Renminbi against the dollar could reduce the value of your investment.\nThe value of our common stock will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Renminbi. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. Dollar could reduce the value in Renminbi of our funds. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of declaring dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the Renminbi, the U.S. dollar equivalent of our earnings from our subsidiaries in China would be reduced.\nOn July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. Dollar. Under the 2005 policy, the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Renminbi appreciated by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. On June 19, 2010, the People\u2019s Bank of China decided to further promote the reform of the Renminbi exchange rate formation mechanism, and improve the flexibility of Renminbi exchange rate. The Company and its subsidiaries (both domestic and overseas) have debts denominated in foreign currencies, fluctuations in the exchange rates of Renminbi and Singapore dollar into foreign currencies creates exchange risk for the Company. With the internationalization process and RMB joining the SDR, RMB exchange rate may continue to fluctuate in the future. In August 2015, the People\u2019s Bank of China perfected its midpoint rate determination mechanism, which led to a 2% depreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. However, it is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC Government to further liberalize its currency policy, which could result in further fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. However, there is no assurance that there will not be a devaluation of Renminbi in the future. If there is such devaluation, our debt servicing cost will increase and the return to our overseas investors may decrease.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the China. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends, or otherwise satisfy foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from the transaction, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate governmental authorities is required where Renminbi are to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies.\nThe PRC government could also restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay certain expenses as they become due.\nRecent international trade tensions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEconomic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions. The global financial markets have experienced significant disruptions in the past, including the recent international trade disputes and tariff actions announced by the United States, the PRC and certain other countries. The U.S. administration has imposed significant amount of tariffs on Chinese goods, and the PRC government has imposed tariffs on certain goods manufactured in the United States. There is no assurance that the list of goods impacted by additional tariffs will not be expanded or the tariffs will not be increased materially. It is difficult to predict how PRC or U.S. government policy, in particular, the outbreak of a trade war between the PRC and the United States and the imposition in 2018 of additional tariffs on bilateral imports, may continue to impact the PRC. If the list of goods is further expanded or the tariff is further increased, the volume of China-U.S. import and export trade would drop significantly, which will lead to deterioration in economic conditions of both countries and decrease of business and official activities between both countries. If any new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or, in particular, if the U.S. government takes retaliatory trade actions due to the recent U.S.-China trade tension, such changes could negatively affect the demand for our products, which may in turn have an adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics, natural disasters and other calamities.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics and natural disasters. In recent years, there have been breakouts of epidemics in China and globally. Our business operations could be disrupted if any of our employees is suspected of having the novel coronavirus, H1N1 flu, avian flu or another epidemic, which would require our employees to be quarantined and/or the facilities used for our operations to be disinfected, and may cause the suspension of manufacturing of our products. In addition, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that such outbreak harms the Chinese economy in general and the automotive industry in particular. The recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) has endangered the health of many people residing in China and significantly disrupted travel and business activities, and economic conditions in China. These events could also significantly impact our industry and cause a temporary shutdown of the facilities we use for our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also vulnerable to natural disasters and other calamities. We cannot assure you that our infrastructure will be adequate to protect us from the effects of fire, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, war, riots, terrorist attacks or similar events. Any of the foregoing events may disrupt our research and development and manufacturer processes, disrupt our business operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 93130, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "CXDC"}
