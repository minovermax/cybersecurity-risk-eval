{"cik": "1080340", "company": "MANHATTAN BRIDGE CAPITAL, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are exposed to certain risk factors that may affect growth and financial results. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our future business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur loan origination activities, revenues and profits are limited by available funds. If we do not increase our working capital, we will not be able to grow our business.\nAs a real estate finance company, our revenue and net income is limited to interest received or accrued on our loan portfolio. Our ability to originate real estate loans is limited by the funds at our disposal. At December 31, 2014, we had virtually no cash or cash equivalents available for loan originations and general operations and no borrowing availability under the Sterling Credit Line. In February 2015, we replaced the Sterling Credit Line with the Webster Credit Line. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $2.18 million of borrowing availability under the Webster Credit Line. We intend to use the proceeds from the repayment of loans outstanding and the additional borrowing capacity under the Webster Credit Line to originate real estate loans. Nevertheless, if demand for our mortgage loans increases, we cannot assure you that we will be able to capitalize on this demand given the limited funds available to us to originate loans.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and competition may limit our ability to originate loans with favorable interest rates.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and we believe these conditions will persist for the foreseeable future as the financial services industry continues to consolidate, producing larger, better capitalized and more geographically diverse companies with broad product and service offerings. Thus, our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to compete effectively. Our competition includes mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, non-bank financial institutions, governmental bodies, family offices and high net worth individuals. We may also compete with companies that partner with and/or receive financing from the U.S. Government. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, larger and more established competitors may enjoy significant competitive advantages, including enhanced operating efficiencies, more extensive referral networks, greater and more favorable access to investment capital and more desirable lending opportunities. Several of these competitors, including mortgage REITs, have recently raised or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital, which enables them to make larger loans or a greater number of loans. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us, such as funding from various governmental agencies or under various governmental programs for which we are not eligible. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of possible loan transactions or to offer more favorable financing terms than we would. Finally, as a REIT and because we operate in a manner so as to be exempt from the requirements of the Investment Company Act, we may face further restrictions to which some of our competitors may not be subject. As a result, we may find that the pool of potential borrowers available to us is limited. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may change our investment, leverage, financing and operating strategies, policies or procedures without shareholder consent, which may adversely affect the market value of our common shares and our ability to make distributions to shareholders.\nWe may amend or revise our policies, including our policies with respect to growth strategy, operations, indebtedness, capitalization, financing alternatives and underwriting criteria and guidelines, or approve transactions that deviate from our existing policies at any time, without a vote of, or notice to, our shareholders. For example, we may decide that in order to compete effectively, we should relax our underwriting guidelines and make riskier loans, which could result in a higher default rate on our portfolio. We may also decide to expand our business focus to other targeted asset classes, such as participation interests in mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and subordinate interests in mortgage loans. We could also decide to adopt investment strategies that include securitizing our portfolio, hedging transactions and swaps. We may even decide to broaden our business to include acquisitions of real estate assets, which we may or may not operate. Finally, as the market evolves, we may determine that the residential and commercial real estate markets do not offer the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns for an investment strategy that is consistent with our intention to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT and to operate in a manner to remain exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act. If we believe it would be advisable for us to be a more active seller of loans and/or interests thereon, we may determine that we should conduct such business through a taxable REIT subsidiary or that we should cease to maintain our REIT qualification. These changes may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk, financing risk and real estate market fluctuations, which could adversely affect our business, operations and financial conditions as well as the value of our securities and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nManagement has broad authority to make lending decisions. If management fails to generate attractive risk-adjusted loans on a consistent basis, our revenue and income could be materially and adversely affected and the market price of a share of our common shares is likely to decrease.\nOur board of directors has given management broad authority to make decisions to originate loans. The only limitation imposed by the board of directors is that no single loan may exceed the lower of (i) 9.9% of our loan portfolio (without taking into account the loan under consideration) and (ii) $1.5 million. Within these broad guidelines, our chief executive officer has the absolute authority to make all lending decisions. Thus, management could authorize transactions that may be costly and/or risky, which could result in returns that are substantially below expectations or that result in losses, which would materially and adversely affect our business operations and results. Further, management\u2019s decisions may not fully reflect the best interests of our shareholders. Our board of directors may periodically review our underwriting guidelines but will not, and will not be required to, review all of our proposed loans. In conducting periodic reviews, our board of directors will rely primarily on information provided to them by management.\nOur chief executive officer and chief financial officer are each critical to our business and our future success may depend on our ability to retain them. In addition, as our business grows we will need to hire additional personnel.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent on the continued efforts of our founder, president and chief executive officer, Assaf Ran, and our chief financial officer, Vanessa Kao. Mr. Ran generates most if not all of our loan applications, supervises all aspects of the underwriting and due diligence process in connection with each loan, structures each loan and has absolute authority (subject only to the maximum amount of the loan) as to whether or not to approve the loan. Ms. Kao services all loans in our portfolio. If Mr. Ran is unable to continue to serve as our chief executive officer on a full-time basis, we might not be able to generate sufficient loan applications and our business and operations would be adversely affected. In addition, in the future we may need to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key personnel, particularly individuals who are experienced in the real estate finance business and people with experience in managing a mortgage REIT. If we are unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, our ability to continue to operate and to grow our business will be impaired.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the real estate industry generally and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe risk of terrorist attacks by extremist groups has risen dramatically over the last year. Any future terrorist attacks, the anticipation of any such attacks, and the consequences of any military or other response by the United States and its allies may have an adverse impact on the U.S. financial markets and the economy in general. In addition, a significant terrorist attack in New York City, such as those recently perpetrated in Paris, France and San Bernardino, California could have a material adverse impact on the New York real estate market, which, in turn, could make it more difficult for our borrowers to repay their loans. We cannot predict the severity of the effect that any such future events would have on the U.S. financial markets, including the real estate capital markets, the economy or our business. Any future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the credit quality of some of our loan portfolio. We may suffer losses as a result of the adverse impact of any future terrorist attacks and these losses may adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe enactment of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, or the TRIA, and the subsequent enactment of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, which extended TRIA through the end of 2020, requires insurers to make terrorism insurance available under their property and casualty insurance policies in order to receive federal compensation under TRIA for insured losses. However, this legislation does not regulate the pricing of such insurance. The absence of affordable insurance coverage may adversely affect the general real estate lending market, lending volume and the market's overall liquidity and may reduce the number of suitable financing opportunities available to us and the pace at which we are able to make loans. If property owners are unable to obtain affordable insurance coverage, the value of their properties could decline and in the event of an uninsured loss, we could lose all or a portion of our investment.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may acquire and store sensitive data on our network, such as our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our prospective and current borrowers. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur existing credit line has numerous covenants. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, the outstanding amount of the loan could become due and payable.\nThe Webster Credit Line contains various covenants and restrictions that are typical for these kinds of credit facilities, including limiting the amount that we can borrow relative to the value of the underlying collateral, maintaining various financial ratios and limitations on the terms of loans we make to our customers. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants, we would be in default under our agreement with Webster, and Webster could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate its commitments to us, require us to post additional collateral and/or enforce their interests against existing collateral. Acceleration of our debt to Webster could significantly reduce our liquidity or require us to sell our assets to repay amounts due and outstanding. This would significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions and could result in the foreclosure of our assets which secure our obligations, which could cause the value of our outstanding securities to decline. A default could also significantly limit our financing alternatives such that we would be unable to pursue our leverage strategy, which could adversely affect our returns.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position.\nWe have, and expect that we will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $12.9 million of debt outstanding, consisting primarily of the amounts outstanding under the Webster Credit Line. Another $2.2 million was available under the Webster Credit Line as of that date. This level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of the indebtedness. Our indebtedness could have other important consequences to you and significantly impact our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 limit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;\n\u2022 expose us to fluctuations in interest rates, to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interest;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022 limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business plan or other general corporate purposes on reasonable terms or at all;\n\u2022 reduce the amount of surplus funds distributable by our subsidiaries to us for use in our business, such as for the payment of indebtedness and dividends to our shareholders; and\n\u2022 lead us to elect to make additional investments in our subsidiaries if their cash flow from operations is insufficient for them to make payments on their indebtedness.\nWe may incur additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The covenants in the agreement governing the Webster Credit Line may limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. To the extent that we are nevertheless able to incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with our indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, will increase.\nRisks Related to Our Portfolio\nIf we overestimate the yields on our loans or incorrectly value the collateral securing the loan, we may experience losses.\nLoan decisions are typically made based on the credit-worthiness of the borrower and the value of the collateral securing the loan. We cannot assure you that our assessments will always be accurate or the circumstances relating to a borrower or the collateral will not change during the loan term, which could lead to losses and write-offs. Losses and write-offs could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition and the market price of our securities.\nDifficult conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgage-related assets as well as the broader financial markets have resulted in a significant contraction in liquidity for mortgages and mortgage-related assets, which may adversely affect the value of the assets that we intend to originate.\nOur results of operations will be materially affected by conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgage-related assets as well as the broader financial markets and the economy generally. In recent years, significant adverse changes in financial market conditions have resulted in a decline in real estate values, jeopardizing the performance and viability of many real estate loans. As a result, many traditional mortgage lenders suffered severe losses and several have even failed. This situation has negatively affected both the terms and availability of financing for small non-bank real estate finance companies. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, business and operations.\nShort-term loans and loans on which the maturity date has been extended may involve a greater risk of loss than traditional mortgage loans.\nBorrowers usually use the proceeds of a long-term mortgage loan or sale to repay our loans. We may therefore depend on a borrower\u2019s ability to obtain permanent financing or sell the property to repay our loan, which could depend on market conditions and other factors. On our balance sheet we make a distinction between short- and long-term loans receivable. Long-term loans receivable are loans that are extended beyond their original maturity dates unless it is clear that the loan will be repaid within one year of the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2015, our long-term loans receivable was $10.7 million compared to $4.9 million at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 long-term loans receivable represented approximately 34.6% of total loans receivable compared to 20.4% at December 31, 2014. These increases may be an indication that property owners are finding it more difficult to sell or refinance their properties. Our loans are also subject to risks of borrower defaults, bankruptcies, fraud, losses and special hazard losses that are not covered by standard hazard insurance. In the event of a default, we bear the risk of loss of principal and non-payment of interest and fees to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the mortgage collateral and the principal amount and unpaid interest of the loan. To the extent we suffer such losses with respect to our loans, our enterprise value and the price of our securities may be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to \u201clender liability\u201d claims. Our financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted if we were to be found liable and required to pay damages.\nIn recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lenders on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed \u201clender liability.\u201d Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders. We cannot assure you that such claims will not arise or that we will not be subject to significant liability if a claim of this type did arise.\nAn increase in the rate of prepayment of outstanding loans may have an adverse impact on the value of our portfolio as well as our revenue and income.\nThe value of our loan portfolio may be affected by prepayment rates and a significant increase in the rate of prepayments could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty and no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment or other such risks. In periods of declining interest rates, prepayment rates on mortgage and other real estate-related loans generally increase. Proceeds of prepayments received during such periods are likely to be reinvested by us in new loans yielding less than the yields on the loans that were prepaid, resulting in lower revenues and possibly, lower profits. A portion of our loan portfolio requires prepayment fees if a loan is prepaid. However, there can be no assurance that these fees will make us whole for the detriment incurred by virtue of the prepayment.\nThe lack of liquidity in our portfolio may adversely affect our business.\nThe illiquidity of our loan portfolio may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. As a result, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the outstanding loan balance.\nThe geographic concentration of our loan portfolio may make our revenues and the values of the mortgages and real estate securing our portfolio vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the New York metropolitan area.\nUnder our current business model, we have one asset class - mortgage loans that we originate, service and manage - and we have no current plans to diversify. Moreover, most of our collateral is located in a limited geographic area. At December 31, 2015, all of our outstanding loans are secured by properties located in the New York metropolitan area. A lack of geographical diversification makes our mortgage portfolio more sensitive to local and regional economic conditions. A significant decline in the New York metropolitan area economy could result in a greater risk of default compared with the default rate for loans secured by properties in other geographic locations. This could result in a reduction of our revenues and provision for loan loss allowances, which might not be as acute if our loan portfolio were more geographically diverse. Therefore, our loan portfolio is subject to greater risk than other real estate finance companies that have a more diversified asset base and broader geographic footprint. To the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in one region and/or one type of asset, downturns relating generally to such region or type of asset may result in defaults on a number of our assets within a short time period, which may reduce our net income and the value of our Securities and accordingly reduce our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nA prolonged economic slowdown, a lengthy or severe recession or declining real estate values could impair our investments and harm our operations.\nA prolonged economic slowdown, a recession or declining real estate values could impair the performance of our assets and harm our financial condition and results of operations, increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. Thus, we believe the risks associated with our business will be more severe during periods of economic slowdown or recession because these periods are likely to be accompanied by declining real estate values. Declining real estate values are likely to have one or more of the following adverse consequences:\n\u00b7 reduce the level of new mortgage and other real estate-related loan originations since borrowers often use appreciation in the value of their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties;\n\u00b7 make it more difficult for existing borrowers to remain current on their payment obligations; and\n\u00b7 significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our cost on the loan.\nAny sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from loans in our portfolio as well as our ability to originate new loans, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and business and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nWe do not carry any loan loss reserves. If we are required to write-off all or a portion of any loan in our portfolio, our net income will be adversely impacted. Loan loss reserves are particularly difficult to estimate in a turbulent economic environment.\nBased on our experience and our periodic evaluation of our loan portfolio, we have not deemed it necessary to create any loan loss reserves. Thus, a loss with respect to all or a portion of a loan in our portfolio will have an immediate and adverse impact on our net income. The valuation process of our loan portfolio requires us to make certain estimates and judgments, which are particularly difficult to determine during a period in which the availability of real estate credit is limited and real estate transactions have decreased. These estimates and judgments are based on a number of factors, including projected cash flows from the collateral securing our mortgage loans, if any, loan structure, including the availability of reserves and recourse guarantees, likelihood of repayment in full at the maturity of a loan, the relative strength or weakness of the refinancing market and expected market discount rates for varying property types. If our estimates and judgments are not correct, our results of operations and financial condition could be severely impacted.\nOur due diligence may not reveal all of a borrower's liabilities and may not reveal other weaknesses in its business.\nBefore making a loan to a borrower, we assess the strength and skills of such entity's management and other factors that we believe are material to the performance of the loan. In making the assessment and otherwise conducting customary due diligence, we rely on the resources available to us and, in some cases, services provided by third parties. This process is particularly important and subjective with respect to newly organized entities because there may be little or no information publicly available about the entities. There can be no assurance that our due diligence processes will uncover all relevant facts or that the borrower\u2019s circumstances will not change after the loan is funded. In either case, this could adversely impact the performance of the loan and our operating results.\nOur loans are usually made to entities to enable them to acquire, develop or renovate residential or commercial property, which may involve a greater risk of loss than loans to individual owners of residential real estate.\nWe make loans to corporations, partnerships and limited liability companies who are looking to purchase, renovate and/or improve residential or commercial real estate held for resale or investment. More often than not, the property is under-utilized, poorly managed, or located in a recovering neighborhood. These loans may have a higher degree of risk than loans to individual property owners with respect to their primary residence or to owners of commercial operating properties because of a variety of factors. For instance, our borrowers usually do not have the need to occupy the property, or an emotional attachment to the property as borrowers of owner-occupied residential properties typically have, and therefore they do not always have the same incentive to avoid foreclosure. Similarly, in the case of non-residential property, a majority of the properties securing our loans have little or no cash flow. If the neighborhood in which the asset is located fails to recover according to the borrower\u2019s projections, or if the borrower fails to improve the quality of the property\u2019s performance and/or the value of the property, the borrower may not receive a sufficient return on the property to satisfy the loan, and we bear the risk that we may not recover some or all of our principal. Finally, there are difficulties associated with collecting debts from entities that may be judgment proof. While we try to mitigate these risks in various ways, including by getting personal guarantees from the principals of the borrower, we cannot assure you that these lending and credit enhancement strategies will be successful.\nVolatility of values of residential and commercial properties may adversely affect our loans and investments.\nResidential and commercial property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, events such as natural disasters, including hurricanes and earthquakes, acts of war and/or terrorism and others that may cause unanticipated and uninsured performance declines and/or losses to us or the owners and operators of the real estate securing our investment; national, regional and local economic conditions, such as what we have experienced in recent years (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of housing, retail, industrial, office or other commercial space); changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, construction cost, age and design; demographic factors; retroactive changes to building or similar codes; and increases in operating expenses (such as energy costs). In the event of a decline in the value of a property securing one of our loans, the borrower may have difficulty repaying our loan, which could result in losses to us. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses.\nOur inability to promptly foreclose on defaulted loans could increase our costs and/or losses.\nThe performance of first mortgage loans may depend on the performance of the underlying real estate collateral. In particular, mortgage loans secured by property held for investment or resale are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure, and risks of loss that are greater than similar risks associated with loans secured by owner-occupied residential properties. The ability of a borrower under a first mortgage loan to repay a loan secured by an income-producing property typically depends primarily on the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan is impaired and the borrower defaults, we may lose all or substantially all of our investment. If the property is not income producing, as is the case with most of our loans, the risks are even greater. While we have certain rights with respect to the real estate collateral underlying a first mortgage loan, and rights against the borrower and guarantor(s), in the event of a default there are a variety of factors that may inhibit our ability to enforce our rights to collect the loan, whether through a non-payment action against the borrower, a foreclosure proceeding against the underlying property or a collection or enforcement proceeding against the guarantor. These factors include, without limitation, state foreclosure timelines and deferrals associated therewith (including with respect to litigation); unauthorized occupants living in the property; federal, state or local legislative action or initiatives designed to provide residential property owners with assistance in avoiding foreclosures and that serve to delay the foreclosure process; government programs that require specific procedures to be followed to explore the refinancing of a residential mortgage loan prior to the commencement of a foreclosure proceeding; and continued declines in real estate values and sustained high levels of unemployment that increase the number of foreclosures and place additional pressure on the already overburdened judicial and administrative systems.\nNone of our loans are funded with interest reserves and our borrowers may be unable to pay the interest accruing on the loans when due, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nOur loans are not funded with an interest reserve. Thus, we rely on the borrowers to make interest payments as and when due from other sources of cash. Given the fact that most of the properties securing our loans are not income producing or even cash producing and most of the borrowers are entities with no assets other than the single property that is the subject of the loan, some of our borrowers have considerable difficulty servicing our loans and the risk of a non-payment of default is considerable. We depend on the borrower\u2019s ability to refinance the loan at maturity or sell the property for repayment. If the borrower is unable to repay the loan, together with all the accrued interest, at maturity, our operating results and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. Foreclosure of a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process that could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy of the borrower, we may not have full recourse to the assets of the borrower, or the assets of the borrower or the guarantor may not be sufficient to satisfy the debt.\nInterest rate fluctuations could reduce our ability to generate income and may cause losses.\nOur primary interest rate exposures relates to the yield on our loan portfolio and the financing cost of our debt. Our operating results depend, in part, on differences between the interest income generated by our loan portfolio net of credit losses and our financing costs. Thus, changes in interest rates will affect our revenue and net income in one or more of the following ways:\n\u00b7 our operating expenses may increase;\n\u00b7 our ability to originate loans may be adversely impacted;\n\u00b7 to the extent we use our credit line or other forms of debt financing to originate loans, our borrowing costs would rise, reducing the \u201cspread\u201d between our cost of funds and the yield on our outstanding mortgage loans, which tend to be fixed rate obligations;\n\u00b7 a rise in interest rates may discourage potential borrowers from refinancing existing loans or defer plans to renovate or improve their properties;\n\u00b7 increase borrower default rates;\n\u00b7 negatively impact property values making our existing loans riskier and new loans that we originate smaller; and\n\u00b7 rising interest rates could also result in reduced turnover of properties which may reduce the demand for new mortgage loans.\nLiability relating to environmental matters may impact the value of properties that we may acquire or the properties underlying our investments.\nUnder various U.S. federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released on its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. The presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect an owner\u2019s ability to sell real estate or borrow using real estate as collateral. To the extent that an owner of a property underlying one of our debt instruments becomes liable for removal costs, the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant mortgage asset held by us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. If we acquire any properties by foreclosure or otherwise, the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs, thus harming our financial condition. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to shareholders.\nDefaults on our loans may cause declines in revenues and net income.\nDefaults by borrowers could result in one or more of the following adverse consequences:\n\u00b7 a decrease in interest income, profitability and cash flow;\n\u00b7 the establishment of or an increase in loan loss reserves;\n\u00b7 write-offs and losses;\n\u00b7 an increase in legal and enforcement costs, as we seek to protect our rights and recover the amounts owed.\n\u00b7 default under our credit facilities; and\n\u00b7 an increase in legal and enforcement costs, as we seek to protect our rights and recover the amounts owed.\nAs a result, we will have less cash available for paying our other operating expenses and for making distributions to our shareholders. This would have a material adverse effect on the market value of our securities.\nOur revenues and the value of our portfolio may be negatively affected by casualty events occurring on properties securing our loans.\nWe require our borrowers to obtain, for our benefit, all risk property insurance covering the property and any improvements to the property collateralizing our loan in an amount intended to be sufficient to provide for the cost of replacement in the event of casualty. However, the amount of insurance coverage maintained for any property may not be sufficient to pay the full replacement cost following a casualty event. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as those arising from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and terrorist attacks, that may be uninsurable or that may not be economically feasible to insure. Changes in zoning, building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors may make it impossible for our borrowers to use insurance proceeds to replace damaged or destroyed improvements at a property. If any of these or similar events occur, the amount of coverage may not be sufficient to replace a damaged or destroyed property and/or to repay in full the amount due on loans collateralized by such property. As a result, our returns and the value of our investment may be reduced.\nBorrower concentration could lead to significant losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, a single borrower or a group of affiliated borrowers may account for more than 10% of our loan portfolio. For example, as of December 31, 2013, two affiliated borrower groups accounted for an aggregate of 25.5% of our loan portfolio. In contrast, as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, no single loan, borrower or group of affiliated borrowers represented more than 10% of our loan portfolio. A default by one borrower in a group is likely to result in a default by the other borrowers in the group. Concentration of loans to one borrower or a group of affiliated borrowers poses a significant risk, as default would have a material adverse impact on our operating results, cash flow, the Webster Credit Line, financial condition and our ability to service our debt.\nRisks Related to Financing Transactions\nOur existing credit line has numerous covenants with which we must comply. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, the outstanding amount of the loan could become due and payable and we may have to sell off a portion of our loan portfolio to pay off the debt.\nWe have a $14.0 million credit line with Webster that expires on February 27, 2018. The Webster Credit Line contains various covenants and restrictions that are typical for these kinds of credit facilities, including limiting the amount that we can borrow relative to the value of the underlying collateral, maintaining various financial ratios and limitations on the terms of loans we make to our customers. The Webster Credit Line imposes certain restrictions which may adversely impact our ability to grow and/or maintain our status as a REIT. These limitations include the following:\n\u00b7 limit our ability to pay dividends under certain circumstances;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to make certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to reduce liquidity below certain levels;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to redeem debt or equity securities;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to determine our operating policies and investment strategies; and\n\u00b7 limit our ability to repurchase our common shares, sell assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, grant liens, and enter into transactions with affiliates.\nIf we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants, we would be in default under our agreement with Webster, and Webster could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate its commitments to us, require us to post additional collateral and/or enforce their interests against existing collateral. Acceleration of our debt to Webster, could also make it difficult for us to satisfy the qualification requirements necessary to maintain our status as a REIT, significantly reduce our liquidity or require us to sell our assets to repay amounts due and outstanding. This would significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions and could result in the foreclosure of our assets which secure our obligations, which could cause the value of our outstanding securities to decline. A default could also significantly limit our financing alternatives such that we would be unable to pursue our leverage strategy, which could adversely affect our returns.\nUnder the terms of the agreement governing the Webster Credit Line, our borrowing capacity is limited to 70% of Eligible Mortgage Loans (as defined). Moreover, Webster, in its discretion, may reduce this percentage. This borrowing limitation is determined, in part, by the value of the real estate securing the loans in our portfolio. Thus, a general decline in real estate values or a change in the percentage will adversely impact our ability to borrow under the Webster Line of Credit and could even result in a situation where any amount in excess of the borrowing limitation will become immediately due and payable. If we default and Webster accelerates the loan we would have to repay the debt immediately with our working capital (i.e., proceeds from loan repayments), sell a portion of our loan portfolio and use the proceeds to repay the debt or refinance with another lender. We cannot assure you that we would be able to replace the Webster Credit Line on similar terms or on any terms. If we have to sell a portion of our loan portfolio, the amount we realize may be less than the face amount of the loans sold, resulting in a loss. If we sell a portion of our portfolio or use proceeds from loan repayments to pay the Webster debt, our opportunities to grow our business will be negatively impacted.\nShort-term notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.1 million will become due will mature on or before February 11, 2017. We cannot assure you that we will be able to extend the maturities of those notes or refinance them.\nAt December 31, 2015, we have outstanding five short-term notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 million. These notes bear interest at rates ranging from 8% to 12%. All of these notes will mature on or before February 11, 2017. Pursuant to the Webster Credit Line, we may not renew or extend these notes when they become due. Accordingly, upon maturity, we will have to repay these loans with working capital or the proceeds of a borrowing under the Webster Line of Credit. In any such case this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition as it will reduce the amount available for increasing our loan portfolio.\nOur access to financing may be limited and, thus, our ability to maximize our returns may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow and compete may also depend on our ability to borrow money to leverage our loan portfolio and to build and manage the cost of expanding our infrastructure to manage and service a larger loan portfolio. In general, the amount, type and cost of any financing that we obtain from another financial institution will have a direct impact on our revenue and expenses and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. The percentage of leverage we employ will vary depending on our assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of our existing portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, the availability and cost of financing, our opinion as to the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy and commercial mortgage markets, our outlook for the level, slope, and volatility of interest rates, the credit quality of our borrowers and the collateral underlying our assets.\nOur access to financing will depend upon a number of factors, over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u00b7 general market conditions;\n\u00b7 the market\u2019s view of the quality of our assets;\n\u00b7 the market\u2019s perception of our growth potential;\n\u00b7 our eligibility to participate in and access capital from programs established by the U.S. Government;\n\u00b7 our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and\n\u00b7 the market price of the shares of our common shares.\nContinuing weakness in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to secure financing on favorable terms or at all. In addition, if regulatory capital requirements imposed on our private lenders change, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to us. In general, this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce our liquidity or require us to sell loans at an inopportune time or price.\nWe cannot assure you that we will always have access to structured financing arrangements when needed. If structured financing arrangements are not available to us we may have to rely on equity issuances, which may be dilutive to our shareholders, or on less efficient forms of debt financing that require a larger portion of our cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for our operations, future business opportunities, cash distributions to our shareholders and other purposes. We cannot assure you that we will have access to such equity or debt capital on favorable terms (including, without limitation, cost and term) at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail our lending activities and/or dispose of loans in our portfolio, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur use of leverage may adversely affect the return on our assets and may reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders, as well as increase losses when economic conditions are unfavorable.\nWe do not have a formal policy limiting the amount of debt we incur and our governing documents contain no limitation on the amount of leverage we may use. We may significantly increase the amount of leverage we utilize at any time without approval of our board of directors. In addition, we may leverage individual assets at substantially higher levels. Incurring substantial debt could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would materially and adversely affect us, including the risk that:\n\u00b7 our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness or we may fail to comply with all of the other covenants contained in the debt, which is likely to result in (i) acceleration of such debt (and any other debt containing a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision) that we may be unable to repay from internal funds or to refinance on favorable terms, or at all, (ii) our inability to borrow unused amounts under our financing arrangements, even if we are current in payments on borrowings under those arrangements and/or (iii) the loss of some or all of our assets pledged or liened to secure our indebtedness to foreclosure or sale;\n\u00b7 our debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions with no assurance that yields will increase with higher financing costs;\n\u00b7 we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, future business opportunities, shareholder distributions or other purposes; and\n\u00b7 we are not able to refinance debt that matures prior to the asset it was used to finance on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur board of directors may adopt leverage policies at any time without the consent of our shareholders, which could result in a portfolio with a different risk profile.\nRisks Related to REIT Status and Investment Company Act Exemption\nWe have minimal experience operating as a REIT or managing a portfolio of assets in the manner necessary to maintain an exemption under the Investment Company Act, which may hinder our ability to achieve our business objectives or result in the loss of our qualification as a REIT.\nUntil 2014, we operated as a taxable C-corporation subject to federal corporate income taxes. While we have been profitable in every year since we started our lending business, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to operate our business successfully once we must operate in conformity with REIT requirements. As a result, we are subject to all of the customary business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business, including the risk that we will not achieve our objectives and, as a result, the value of our common shares could decline substantially.\nThe rules and regulations applicable to REITs under the Code are highly technical and complex and the failure to comply with these rules and regulations in a timely manner could prevent us from qualifying as a REIT or could force us to pay unexpected taxes and penalties. None of our executive officers have any experience managing a portfolio of assets under these complex rules and regulations or operating a business in compliance with the numerous technical restrictions and limitations set forth in the Code applicable to REITs. In addition, we will be required to develop and implement or invest in substantial control systems and procedures in order for us to maintain our qualification as a public REIT. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully operate as a REIT or comply with rules and regulations applicable to REITs, which would substantially reduce our earnings and may reduce the value of our securities. In addition, in order to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, the assets in our portfolio will be subject to certain restrictions, which will limit our operations meaningfully. Neither of our executive officers has any experience managing a portfolio in the manner necessary to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, and no experience managing a public company under the constraints imposed by the Investment Company Act.\nOur financial statements may be materially affected if our estimates prove to be inaccurate.\nFinancial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Different estimates, judgments and assumptions reasonably could be used that would have a material effect on the financial statements, and changes in these estimates, judgments and assumptions are likely to occur from period to period in the future. Significant areas of accounting requiring the application of management\u2019s judgment include, but are not limited to, assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently uncertain, and, if they prove to be wrong, then we face the risk that charges to income will be required. For example, currently, we do not carry any loan loss reserves. However, a decline in economic condition could negatively impact the credit quality of our loan portfolio and require us to establish loan loss reserves, which could have an adverse impact on our net income. In addition, because we have limited operating history as a REIT and limited experience in making these estimates, judgments and assumptions, the risk of future charges to income may be greater than if we had more experience in these areas. Any such charges could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities.\nComplying with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to maximize profits, which would reduce the amount of cash available to be distributed to our shareholders. This could have a negative impact on the value of our securities.\nIn order to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things, the composition of our assets, our sources of income, the amounts we distribute to our shareholders and the ownership of our capital stock. Specifically, we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of such issuer. In addition, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer, other than a qualified REIT security. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we must dispose of the portion of our assets in excess of such amounts within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. In such event, we may be forced to sell non-qualifying assets at less than their fair market value. As a result of these requirements, our operating costs may increase to ensure compliance. For example, as a REIT, we may depend to a much greater extent than we currently do on communications and information systems. We may have to upgrade our existing systems in order to monitor a larger portfolio of loans, to track our revenue to make sure we do not inadvertently fail the revenue requirements for a REIT and to make sure that we distribute the requisite amount of our income to shareholders. In addition, we have to hire additional personnel to sustain a higher level of business and a larger portfolio. Thus, it is very likely that our operating expenses will increase and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our profitability at our historical levels. In addition, we may also be required to make distributions to shareholders at times when we do not have funds readily available for distribution or are otherwise not optional for us. Accordingly, compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits.\nOur failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nWe intend to continue to operate in a manner that will enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes as long as we believe it is in the best interests of our shareholders. While we believe that we qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ended December 31, 2015, we have not requested and do not intend to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, that we qualify as a REIT for 2015 or future years. The U.S. federal income tax laws and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder governing REITs are complex. In addition, judicial and administrative interpretations of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REIT qualification are limited. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet, on an ongoing basis, various tests regarding the nature of our assets and our income, the ownership of our outstanding shares, and the amount of our distributions. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. Thus, while we intend to operate so that we will continue to qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will so qualify for any particular year. These considerations also might restrict the types of assets that we can acquire in the future.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income, and distributions to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in determining our taxable income. In such a case, we might need to borrow money or sell assets in order to pay our taxes. Our payment of income tax would decrease the amount of our income available for distribution to our shareholders. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we no longer would be required to distribute substantially all of our taxable income to our shareholders. In addition, unless we were eligible for certain statutory relief provisions, we could not re-elect to qualify as a REIT until the fifth calendar year following the year in which we failed to qualify.\nREIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and may require us to incur debt or sell assets to make such distributions.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our shareholders, each calendar year, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (including certain items of non-cash income), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we are subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income. In addition, we will incur a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to distribute our net income to our shareholders in a manner that will satisfy the REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid the 4% nondeductible excise tax.\nUnder the terms of the agreement governing the Webster Line of Credit, we are prohibited from paying dividends with respect to our common shares if at the time during the 90-day period before the payment of the dividend and the 90-day period following the payment of the dividend we are within $500,000 of our maximum borrowing ability under the facility. Under these circumstances, we would have to choose to either pay the dividend putting us in default under the Webster Credit Line and maintain our REIT status or not pay the dividend and jeopardize our REIT status. In either case, there would be material adverse consequences to us and our shareholders.\nOur taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined by U.S. GAAP and differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur. For example, we may be required to accrue interest and discount income on mortgage loans before we receive any payments of interest or principal on such assets. We may be required under the terms of the indebtedness that we incur, to use cash received from interest payments to make principal payment on that indebtedness, with the effect that we will recognize income but will not have a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year and find it difficult or impossible to meet the REIT distribution requirements in certain circumstances. In such circumstances, we may be required to: (i) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms, (iii) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, (iv) make a taxable distribution of our shares as part of a distribution in which shareholders may elect to receive shares or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution) cash or (v) use cash reserves, in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% nondeductible excise tax. Thus, compliance with the REIT distribution requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our securities.\nEven if we qualify as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.\nAs a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, franchise, property and transfer taxes, including mortgage recording taxes. In addition, in order to meet the REIT qualification requirements, or to avoid the imposition of a 100% tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from sales of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we may create \u201ctaxable REIT subsidiaries\u201d to hold some of our assets. Any taxes paid by such subsidiary corporations would decrease the cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nOur qualification as a REIT may depend on the accuracy of legal opinions or advice rendered or given and the inaccuracy of any such opinions, advice or statements may adversely affect our REIT qualification and result in significant corporate-level tax.\nIn determining whether we qualify as a REIT, we may rely on opinions or advice of counsel as to whether certain types of assets that we hold or acquire are deemed REIT real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests and produce income which qualifies under the 75% REIT gross income test. The inaccuracy of any such opinions, advice or statements may adversely affect our REIT qualification and result in significant corporate-level tax.\nWe may choose to make distributions in shares of our capital stock, in which case you may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive.\nWe may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash and/or common shares at the election of each shareholder. Shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income. As a result, shareholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash portion of the dividend. Accordingly, shareholders receiving a distribution of common shares may be required to sell those shares or may be required to sell other assets they own at a time that may be disadvantageous in order to satisfy any tax imposed on the distribution they receive from us. If a shareholder sells the common shares that he or she receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common shares at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common shares, by withholding or disposing of some of the common shares in the distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed. In addition, if a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell our common shares in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sale may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common shares.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates on dividend income from regular corporations, which could adversely affect the value of our common shares.\nDividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced rates generally applicable to dividends but are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income. Although the reduced U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to dividend income from regular corporate dividends does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends paid by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends. This could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common shares.\nLiquidation of our assets may jeopardize our REIT qualification.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income. If we are compelled to liquidate our assets to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, thereby jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT. In addition, we may be subject to a 100% tax on any gain realized from the sale of assets that are treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.\nThe ownership restrictions set forth in our restated certificate of incorporation may not prevent five or fewer shareholders from owning 50% or more of our outstanding shares of capital stock causing us to lose our status as a REIT, which may inhibit market activity in our common shares and restrict our business combination opportunities.\nIn order for us to qualify as a REIT, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding common shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year, and at least 100 persons must beneficially own our stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate portion of a shorter taxable year. To help insure that we meet the tests, our restated certificate of incorporation restricts the acquisition and ownership of our capital stock. The ownership limitation is fixed at 4.0 % of our outstanding shares of capital stock, by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive. Assaf Ran, our chief executive officer, is exempt from this restriction. As of December 31, 2015, Mr. Ran owns 34.57% of our outstanding common shares. In addition, our board of directors may grant such an exemption to such limitations in its sole discretion, subject to such conditions, representations and undertakings as it may determine. These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for shares of our common shares or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders.\nThe tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing mortgage loans that would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nA REIT\u2019s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including mortgage loans, held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We might be subject to this tax if we were to sell or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans as inventory for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although at the present time we have no plans to sell any of our loans, in the future we may need to sell all or a portion of our portfolio in order to raise funds, reduce our exposure to certain risks or for other reasons. In such event, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may be required to structure the sales in ways that may be less beneficial than we would if we were not a REIT.\nWe may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our common shares.\nAt any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws or regulations governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be changed, possibly with retroactive effect. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective or whether any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our shareholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to make distributions to our shareholders at any time in the future.\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our taxable income each year. We intend to satisfy this requirement through quarterly distributions of all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in such year, subject to certain adjustments. Our ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the risk factors described in this report. If we distribute proceeds from the sale of Securities, which would generally be considered to be a return of capital for tax purposes, our future earnings and cash available for distribution may be reduced from what they otherwise would have been. All distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our earnings, our financial condition, our liquidity, our debt and preferred stock covenants, maintenance of our REIT qualification, applicable provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law (NYBCL), and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We believe that a change in any one of the following factors could adversely affect our results of operations and impair our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders:\n\u00b7 how we deploy the net proceeds from the sale of Securities;\n\u00b7 our ability to make loans at favorable interest rates;\n\u00b7 expenses that reduce our cash flow;\n\u00b7 defaults in our asset portfolio or decreases in the value of our portfolio; and\n\u00b7 the fact that anticipated operating expense levels may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates.\nA change in any of these factors could affect our ability to make distributions. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to make distributions to our shareholders at any time in the future or that the level of any distributions we do make to our shareholders will achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn addition, distributions that we make to our shareholders will generally be taxable to our shareholders as ordinary income. However, a portion of our distributions may be designated by us as long-term capital gains to the extent that they are attributable to capital gain income recognized by us or may constitute a return of capital to the extent that they exceed our earnings and profits as determined for tax purposes. A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a shareholder\u2019s investment in our shares of common shares.\nWe could be materially and adversely affected if we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nWe intend to conduct our business in a manner that will qualify for the exception from the Investment Company Act set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. The SEC generally requires that, for the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to be available, at least 55% of an entity\u2019s assets be comprised of mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, also known as \u201cqualifying interests,\u201d and at least another 25% of the entity\u2019s assets must be comprised of additional qualifying interests or real estate-type interests (with no more than 20% of the entity\u2019s assets comprised of miscellaneous assets). Any significant acquisition by us of non-real estate assets without the acquisition of substantial real estate assets could cause us to meet the definitions of an \u201cinvestment company.\u201d If we are deemed to be an investment company, we could be required to dispose of non-real estate assets or a portion thereof, potentially at a loss, in order to qualify for the 3(c)(5)(C) exception. We may also be required to register as an investment company if we are unable to dispose of the disqualifying assets, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRegistration under the Investment Company Act would require us to comply with a variety of substantive requirements that impose, among other things:\n\u00b7 limitations on capital structure;\n\u00b7 restrictions on specified investments;\n\u00b7 restrictions on leverage or senior securities;\n\u00b7 restrictions on unsecured borrowings;\n\u00b7 prohibitions on transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7 compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly increase our operating expenses.\nIf we were required to register as an investment company but failed to do so, we could be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us.\nRegistration with the SEC as an investment company would be costly, would subject us to a host of complex regulations and would divert attention from the conduct of our business, which could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, if we purchase or sell any real estate assets to avoid becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our net asset value, the amount of funds available for investment and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares\nWe are effectively controlled by our shareholders whose interest may not always be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Assaf Ran, our chief executive officer, beneficially owns 34.57% of our outstanding shares. Thus, Mr. Ran currently has and will continue to exercise effective control over all corporate actions. This concentration of ownership could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common shares.\nThere is limited trading in our common shares, which could make it difficult for you to sell your common shares.\nOur common shares are listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Average daily trading volume in our common shares was approximately 38,000 shares in 2014 and 39,000 shares in 2015. The lack of liquidity may make it more difficult for you to sell your common shares when you wish to do so. Even if an active trading market develops, the market price of our common shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations.\nThe market prices of our common shares may be adversely affected by future events.\nMarket factors unrelated to our performance could also negatively impact the value of our securities, including the market price of our common shares. One of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common shares is our distribution rate as a percentage of our share price relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective investors may demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments paying higher dividends or interest. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and conditions in the capital markets can affect the market value of our common shares. For instance, if interest rates rise, it is likely that the market price of our common shares will decrease as market rates on interest-bearing securities increase. Other factors that could negatively affect the market price of our common shares include:\n\u00b7 our actual or projected operating results, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, or changes in business strategy or prospects;\n\u00b7 actual or perceived conflicts of interest with individuals, including our executive officers;\n\u00b7 equity issuances by us, or share resales by our shareholders, or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated accounting problems;\n\u00b7 changes in our earnings estimates or publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future;\n\u00b7 additions to or departures of our key personnel;\n\u00b7 speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7 our failure to meet, or the lowering of, our earnings\u2019 estimates or those of any securities analysts;\n\u00b7 increases in market interest rates, which may lead investors to demand a higher distribution yield for our common shares, would result in increased interest expenses on our debt;\n\u00b7 changes in the credit markets;\n\u00b7 failure to maintain our REIT qualification or exemption from the Investment Company Act;\n\u00b7 actions by our shareholders;\n\u00b7 price and volume fluctuations in the stock market generally;\n\u00b7 general market and economic conditions, including the current state of the credit and capital markets;\n\u00b7 sales of large blocks of our common shares;\n\u00b7 sales of our common shares by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders; and\n\u00b7 restatements of our financial results and/or material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nThe price of our common shares is volatile, and purchasers of our common shares could incur substantial losses.\nHistorically, the price at which our common shares trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market has been extremely volatile and seemingly unrelated to our operating performance. In 2014, the price of our common shares on NASDAQ ranged from $1.58 to $4.10. In 2015, the range was $2.98 to $4.78. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares. Class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Any such litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and results of operations, divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nCommon shares eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price.\nAt December 31, 2015, we have outstanding options to purchase 35,000 common shares with exercise prices range from $1.02 to $2.92 per share, outstanding warrants to purchase 70,169 shares at a price of $3.5625 per share, and outstanding warrants to purchase 50,750 shares at a price of $5.4875 per share (exercisable after May 22, 2016). Upon issuance, the common shares underlying these options and warrants would be immediately saleable. We cannot predict the effect, if any, the exercise of these options or the future sale of the common shares issuable upon the exercise of these options would have on the market price of our common shares. The market price of our common shares may decline significantly when the restrictions on resale or lock up agreements by certain of our shareholders lapse. Sales of substantial amounts of common shares or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common shares.\nWe may, from time-to-time, issue common shares and securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, common shares to attract or retain key employees or in public offerings or private placements to raise capital. We are not required to offer any such shares or securities to existing shareholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, it may not be possible for existing shareholders to participate in such future share or security issuances, which may dilute the existing shareholders\u2019 interests in us.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities, which would rank senior to our common shares, may adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nIf we decide to issue debt or equity securities in the future, which would rank senior to our common shares, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common shares and may result in dilution to owners of our common shares. We and, indirectly, our shareholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common shares will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common shares and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nCertain provisions of New York law could inhibit changes in control.\nVarious provisions of the NYBCL may have the effect of deterring a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common shares with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common shares. For example, we are subject to the \u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions of the NYBCL that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations (including a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) between us and an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 20% or more of our then outstanding voting capital stock or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder.) After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between us and an interested shareholder generally must be recommended by our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of our voting capital stock other than shares held by the interested shareholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder. These provisions do not apply if holders of our common shares receive a minimum price, as defined under the NYCBL, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares. They also do not apply to business combinations that are approved or exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder.\nOur authorized but unissued common and preferred shares may prevent a change in our control.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 25,000,000 common shares and 5,000,000 preferred shares. Currently, we have 7,441,039 common shares issued and 7,264,039 outstanding and no preferred shares outstanding. Our board of directors has the power and authority to create classes of common or preferred shares, with such rights and designations as it deems appropriate or advisable, which rights and designations may be senior to or have a priority over the rights and designations of any existing class of common or preferred shares. For example, our board of directors may establish a series of common or preferred shares that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common shares or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders.\nOur rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interests.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our present and former directors to us and our shareholders for money damages to any breach of duty in such capacity, if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to a present or former officer or director establishes that his or her acts or omissions were in bad faith or involved intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or that he or she personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled or that his or her acts violated Section 719 of the NYBCL. Section 719 of the NYBCL limits directory liability to the following four instances:\n\u00b7 declarations of dividends in violation of the NYBCL;\n\u00b7 a purchase or redemption by a corporation of its own shares in violation of the NYBCL;\n\u00b7 distributions of assets to shareholders following dissolution of the corporation without paying or providing for all known liabilities; and\n\u00b7 making any loans to directors in violation of the BCL.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorizes us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by the NYBCL. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the defense costs incurred by our present and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification.\nOur bylaws contain provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our shareholders to effect changes to our management.\nOur bylaws provide that, a director may be removed by either the board of directors or by shareholders for cause. Vacancies may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum, unless the vacancy occurred as a result of shareholder action, in which case the vacancy must be filled by a vote of shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders duly called for that purpose. These requirements make it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in control of our company that is in the best interests of our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 86887, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "LOAN"}
