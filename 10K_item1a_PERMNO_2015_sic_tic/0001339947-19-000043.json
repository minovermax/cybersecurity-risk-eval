{"cik": "1339947", "company": "Viacom Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-11-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nA wide range of risks may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, now and in the future. We consider the risks described below to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable factors that could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Viacom\u2019s Business and Industry\nChanges in Consumer Behavior, as Well as New Technologies, Distribution Platforms and Packaging, May Negatively Affect Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nTechnology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly, and new distribution platforms, as well as increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies, have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenue streams.\nTechnological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and have affected the options available to advertisers for reaching their target audiences. The evolution of consumer preferences away from linear pay television, away from physical towards digital services, and away from rental and purchased services towards subscription services, and the substantial increase in availability of programming without advertising or adequate methodologies for audience measurement, may continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, consumers are increasingly using time-shifting and advertising-blocking technologies that enable users to fast-forward or circumvent advertisements, and substantial use of these technologies could impact the attractiveness of our programming to advertisers, adversely affecting our advertising revenue.\nIn response to perceived consumer demand, distributors of programming and program services are continuing to develop alternative offerings for consumers, including \u201cskinny bundles,\u201d smaller, often customizable programming packages delivered at lower costs than traditional offerings; SVOD and other subscription services; ad-supported, free video-on-demand services; and original programming hosted on mobile and social media platforms. If these alternative offerings continue to gain traction and our networks and brands are not included in those packages and services, or if consumers increasingly favor alternative offerings over traditional cable subscriptions, we may continue to experience a decline in viewership and ultimately demand for our programming, which could lead to lower revenues. These changing distribution models may also impact our ability to negotiate carriage deals on terms favorable to us, thereby having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models and strategies to remain competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully anticipate or respond to these developments, that we will not experience disruption as we respond to the developments, or that the business models we develop will be as profitable as our current business models. Our inability to protect and exploit the value of our content, while adapting to and developing new technology and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Businesses Operate in an Industry That Is Highly Competitive and Swiftly Consolidating\nCompanies in the television programming, film, digital, consumer products, live events and recreation businesses depend on the popularity of content and other offerings, appeal to advertisers and widespread distribution of their content. We compete with other media companies to attract creative talent and produce high quality content, and for distribution on a variety of third-party platforms to draw large audiences. Competition for talent, content, audiences, service providers, production infrastructure, advertising and distribution is intense and comes from broadcast television, other cable networks (including our own), OTT distributors, social media platforms, film studios and independent film producers and distributors, consumer products companies and other entertainment outlets and platforms, as well as from search engines, program guides and \u201csecond screen\u201d applications. Further, competition from additional entrants into the market for development and production of original programming, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Hulu, Netflix and YouTube, continues to increase.\nOur ability to obtain widespread distribution on favorable terms, which contributes to our ability to attract audiences and, in turn, advertisers, is adversely affected by the consolidation of programmers, distributors (including telecom companies) and television service providers. This consolidation reduces the number of distributors with whom we negotiate and increases the negotiating leverage and market power of the combined companies. In addition, consolidation in the film business may adversely affect the distribution of our films on various platforms.\nIn addition, our competitors include market participants with interests in multiple media businesses that are often vertically integrated, whereas our Media Networks business generally relies on distribution relationships with third parties. As more cable and satellite operators, Internet service providers, telecom companies and other content distributors, aggregators and search providers create or acquire their own content, they may have significant competitive advantages, which could adversely affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms for distribution or otherwise compete effectively in the delivery marketplace. Our competitors could also have preferential access to important technologies, customer data or other competitive information, as well as significant financial resources.\nThis competition and consolidation could result in lower ratings and advertising, lower affiliate and other revenues, and increased content costs and promotional and other expenses, negatively affecting our ability to generate revenues and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that competition or consolidation in the marketplace will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Success Depends on Our Ability to Maintain Attractive Brands and Produce Popular Programming, Films and Other Entertainment Content, Which Is Difficult to Predict\nOur ability to maintain attractive brands and create popular entertainment content, successful tentpole events and consumer products, recreation and live events offerings are key to the success of our business and our ability to generate revenues. The production and distribution of programming, films and other entertainment content is inherently risky because the revenues we derive from various sources primarily depend on our ability to satisfy consumer tastes and expectations in a consistent manner. The popularity of our content is affected by our ability to maintain or develop strong brand awareness and target key audiences, the quality and attractiveness of competing entertainment content and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, including online, mobile and other offerings. Audience tastes change frequently and it is a challenge to anticipate what offerings will be successful at any point in time. We invest substantial capital in our content, including in the production of original content on our networks, in our films and in our television production business, before learning the extent to which it will garner critical success and popularity with consumers.\nIn our Media Networks business, the popularity of our brands and programming has a significant impact on the revenues we are able to generate from advertising, affiliate fees and consumer products and other licensing activities, and our ability to expand our presence internationally depends, in part, on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and\npreferences outside the U.S. In our Filmed Entertainment business, the theatrical performance of a film affects not only the theatrical revenues we receive but also revenues from other distribution outlets, such as TVOD and SVOD, television, home entertainment and licensed consumer products. As a result, a lack of popularity of our offerings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in a particular period or over a longer term.\nOur Advertising Revenues Have Been and May Continue to Be Adversely Impacted By Declines in Linear Television Viewing, Deficiencies in Audience Measurement and Advertising Market Conditions\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on a variety of platforms, and a decline in advertising revenues could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in any given period.\nConsumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, and an increasing number of companies offer SVOD services, including some that offer exclusive high-quality original video programming and programming delivered directly to consumers over the Internet. The increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and reduced the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video providers, which has caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our cable networks and may adversely affect the pricing and volume of advertising.\nIn addition, advertising sales are largely dependent on audience measurement, and the results of audience measurement techniques can vary for a variety of reasons, including the platforms on which viewing is measured and variations in the statistical sampling methods used. While Nielsen\u2019s statistical sampling method is the primary measurement technique used in our television advertising sales, we measure and monetize our campaign reach and frequency on and across digital platforms based on other third-party data as well as first-party data using a variety of methods, including the number of impressions served and demographics. In addition, multi-platform campaign verification remains in its infancy, and viewership on tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices, which continues to grow rapidly, still is not measured by any one consistently applied method. These variations and changes could have a significant effect on our advertising revenues.\nThe strength of the advertising market can fluctuate in response to the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, advertisers\u2019 current spending priorities and the economy in general, and this may adversely affect our advertising revenues. Natural and other disasters, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could lead to a reduction in domestic and international advertising expenditures as a result of disrupted programming and services, uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. Our ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for our content, the consumers in our targeted demographics, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers. The pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts toward new ways of purchasing advertising, such as through automated purchasing and advertising exchanges, some or all of which may not be as advantageous to us as current advertising methods.\nThese factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause We Derive a Significant Portion of Our Revenues from a Limited Number of Distributors, the Loss of Affiliation Agreements, Renewal on Less Favorable Terms or Adverse Interpretations Could Have a Significant Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nA significant portion of our revenues are attributable to agreements with a limited number of cable television, direct-to-home satellite television and telecommunications operators, subscription- and advertising-supported video-on-demand services, and other distributors of our programming and program services. Our affiliation agreements generally have fixed terms that vary by market and distributor, and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future, or renewed on favorable terms, including but not limited to those related to pricing and programming tiers. We may also be unable to modify existing agreements with terms that have over time become less favorable. The loss of favorable packaging and positioning, the loss of carriage on the most widely available cable and satellite programming tiers or the failure to renew our agreements with any distributor, or renew or modify them on favorable terms, could reduce the distribution of our programming and program services and decrease the potential audience for our programs, thereby negatively affecting our growth prospects and revenues from both advertising and affiliate fees.\nSimilarly, our revenues are dependent on the compliance of major distributors with the terms of our affiliation agreements. As these agreements have grown in complexity, the number of disputes regarding the interpretation, and even validity, of the agreements has grown, resulting in greater uncertainty and, from time to time, litigation with respect to our rights and\nobligations. For example, some of our distribution agreements contain \u201cmost favored nation\u201d (\u201cMFN\u201d) clauses, which provide that if we enter into an agreement with a distributor and such agreement includes specified terms that are more favorable than those held by a distributor holding an MFN right, we must offer some of those terms to the distributor holding the MFN right. These clauses are generally complex and may lead to disagreement over their interpretation and application. Disagreements with a distributor on the interpretation or validity of an agreement could adversely impact our revenues from both advertising and affiliate fees, as well as our relationship with that distributor.\nThese factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nService Disruptions or Failures of, or Cybersecurity Attacks Upon, Our or Our Vendors\u2019 Networks, Information Systems and Other Technologies Could Result in the Disclosure of Confidential or Valuable Business or Personal Information, Disruption of Our Businesses, Damage to Our Brands and Reputation, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses\nNetworks, cloud services, information systems and other technologies, including technology systems used in connection with the production and distribution of our programming and films by us or our third-party vendors (\u201cSystems\u201d), are critical to our business activities, and shutdowns or service disruptions of, and cybersecurity attacks upon, these Systems pose increasing risks. Such shutdowns, disruptions and attacks may be caused by third-party hacking of computers and systems; dissemination of computer viruses, worms, malware, ransomware and other destructive or disruptive software; denial of service attacks and other bad acts; human error; and power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Shutdowns, disruptions and attacks from such events could have an adverse impact on us, our business partners, our employees, our audiences and users of our online, mobile and app offerings, including degradation or disruption of service, loss of data and damage to equipment and data. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to cover everything that could happen. Significant events could result in a disruption of our operations, reduced revenues, the loss of or damage to the integrity of data used by management to make decisions and operate our businesses, viewer or advertiser dissatisfaction or a loss of viewers or advertisers, and damage to our reputation or brands. We may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any losses associated with such events.\nWe are also subject to risks caused by the misappropriation, misuse, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of business or personal data or programming content maintained in our or our third-party vendors\u2019 Systems, including proprietary and personal information (of third parties, employees and users of our online, mobile and app offerings), business information including intellectual property, or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to penetrate our Systems or those of our third-party vendors, including cloud service providers, or fraudulently induce employees, business partners or users of our online, mobile and app offerings to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 data, or our programming. The number and sophistication of attempted and successful information security breaches in the U.S. and elsewhere have increased in recent years. If a material breach of our Systems or those of our third-party vendors occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our information security measures could be harmed, we could lose advertisers and other business partners as well as users of our online, mobile and app offerings and viewers, and our reputation, brands and credibility could be damaged. In addition, if a material breach of our Systems occurs, we could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace such Systems or to comply with notification requirements. We could also be subject to actions by regulatory authorities and claims asserted in private litigation in the event of a breach of our or our third-party vendors\u2019 Systems.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or disable, degrade or sabotage, these Systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures or remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these preventative and detective measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated.\nEach of these factors could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Failure, Destruction and/or Breach of Satellites and Facilities that We Depend Upon to Distribute Our Programming Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nWe use satellite systems, fiber and other methods to transmit our program services to cable television operators and other distributors worldwide. The distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. Notwithstanding\ncertain back-up and redundant systems, transmissions may be disrupted as a result of power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, failures or impairments of communications satellites or on-ground uplinks or downlinks used to transmit programming or other similar events. Currently, there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming, and if a disruption occurs, we may not be able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that such failure or disruption would not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTheft of Our Content, Including Digital Copyright Theft and Other Unauthorized Exhibitions of Our Content, Reduces Revenue Received from Legitimate Distribution of Our Programming, Films and Other Entertainment Content and Adversely Affects Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nThe success of our businesses depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights. We are fundamentally a content company and theft of our content - specifically, the infringement of our films and home entertainment products, television programming, digital content and other intellectual property rights - affects us and the value of our content. Intellectual property theft is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that either lack effective laws and technical protection measures similar to those existing in the U.S. and Europe or lack effective enforcement of such measures, or both. Such foreign copyright theft often creates a supply of pirated content for major markets as well. The interpretation of copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws as applied to our content, and our infringement-detection and enforcement efforts, remain in flux, and some methods of enforcement have encountered political opposition. The failure to appropriately enforce and/or the weakening of existing intellectual property laws could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property and thus negatively affect its value.\nContent theft is made easier by the wide availability of higher bandwidth and reduced storage costs, as well as tools that undermine encryption and other security features and enable infringers to cloak their identities online. We and our numerous production and distribution partners operate various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming and films, and intentional or unintentional acts could result in unauthorized access to our content. The continuing proliferation of digital formats and technologies heightens this risk. The unauthorized distribution and consumption of our content through a wide array of platforms and devices remain problematic and an ever-present challenge, as Internet-connected televisions, set-top boxes and mobile devices are ubiquitous and many can support illegal re-transmission platforms, OTT subscription services, illicit video-on-demand/streaming services and pre-loaded hardware, providing more accessible, versatile and legitimate-looking environments for consuming pirated film and television content. Unauthorized access to our content could result in the premature release of films or television shows as well as a reduction in legitimate audiences, which would likely have significant adverse effects on the value of the affected programming and our ability to monetize our content.\nCopyright theft has an adverse effect on our business because it reduces the revenue that we are able to receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content, undermines lawful distribution channels, reduces the public\u2019s and some affiliate partners\u2019 perceived value of our content and inhibits our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred to create such content. While legal protections exist, piracy and technological tools with which to engage in copyright theft continue to escalate, evolve and present challenges for enforcement. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, and it is likely that we will continue to expend substantial resources in connection with these efforts. Efforts to prevent the unauthorized reproduction, distribution and exhibition of our content may affect our profitability and may not be successful in preventing harm to our business and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased Costs for Programming, Films and Other Rights, and Judgments We Make on the Potential Performance of our Content, May Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nIn our Media Networks segment, we have historically produced a significant amount of original programming and other content, and as part of our business strategy we invest significant resources in our flagship brands, in part with the aim of developing higher quality and quantity of original content. In our Filmed Entertainment business, we invest significant amounts in the production, marketing and distribution of films and television series.\nWe also acquire programming, films and television series, as well as a variety of digital content and other ancillary rights such as consumer and home entertainment product offerings, and we pay license fees, royalties and/or contingent compensation in connection with these acquired rights. We also license various music rights from the major record companies, music publishers and performing rights organizations.\nOur investments in original and acquired programming are significant and involve complex negotiations with numerous third parties, and rapid changes in consumer behavior have increased the risk associated with the success of all kinds of programming. Competition for popular content is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay for talent and intellectual property rights, which may result in significantly increased costs. Further, increased competition from additional entrants into the market for development and production of original programming, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Hulu, Netflix and YouTube, increases our content costs as they introduce different ways of compensating talent and approaching production. In addition, as competition for the creation and acquisition of quality programming continues to escalate, the complexity of negotiations over acquired rights to the content and the value of the rights we aim to acquire may increase, leading to increased acquisition costs, and our ability to successfully acquire content of the highest quality may face greater uncertainty. Finally, certain of our counterparties and vendors may encounter financial and operational pressures, which could result in increased costs to us or delays in production. As such, there can be no assurance that we will recoup our investments in programming, films and other content when the content is broadcast or distributed.\nThe accounting for the expenses we incur in connection with our programming, films and other content requires that we make judgments about the potential success and useful life of the program or film. If our estimates prove to be incorrect, it may result in decreased revenues and profitability and the accelerated recognition of the expense and/or write-down of the value of the asset. We estimate the ultimate revenues of a film before it is released based on a number of factors, and we then update our estimate of ultimate revenues, including following a film\u2019s initial theatrical release, based on expected future and actual results. If we reduce our estimate of ultimate revenues, it may result in the accelerations of capitalized film cost amortization. Similarly, if we determine it is no longer advantageous for us to air a program on our media networks, we would accelerate our amortization of the program costs.\nThese factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Loss of Key Talent Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nOur business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of not only our corporate and divisional executive teams, but also the various creative talent and entertainment personalities with whom we work. For example, we employ or contract with several entertainment personalities with loyal audiences and we produce films with highly regarded directors, producers, writers, actors and other talent. These individuals are important to achieving the success of our programs, films and other content. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or will retain their current appeal, or that the costs associated with retaining them or new talent will be reasonable. If we fail to retain these individuals on current terms or if our entertainment personalities lose their current appeal or we fail to attract new talent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPolitical and Economic Conditions in a Variety of Markets around the World Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nOur businesses operate and have audiences, customers and partners worldwide, and we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets, some of which are emerging markets. For that reason, economic conditions in many different markets around the world affect a number of aspects of our businesses, in particular revenues in both domestic and international markets derived from advertising sales, theatrical releases, home entertainment distribution, television licensing and sales of consumer products. Economic conditions in each market can also impact our audience\u2019s discretionary spending and therefore their willingness to access our content, as well as the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks, causing them to reduce their spending on advertising. We may also be subject to longer payment cycles. In addition, as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar (compared to, for example, the Argentinian peso, the British pound and the Euro, among others) has increased. Such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain stable in any period.\nOur businesses are also exposed to certain political risks inherent in conducting a global business, including retaliatory actions by governments reacting to changes in the U.S. and other countries, including in connection with trade negotiations; issues related to the presence of corruption in certain markets and enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations; increased risk of political instability in some markets as well as conflict and sanctions preventing us from accessing those markets; escalating\ntrade, immigration and nuclear disputes; wars, acts of terrorism or other hostilities; and other political, economic or other uncertainties.\nDepending on the ultimate terms and outcome of ongoing negotiations and political turmoil regarding the UK\u2019s departure from the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d), the UK could lose access to the single EU market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The effects of Brexit and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU may continue to adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic and market conditions in the UK, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere and contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the Euro and the British Pound. In addition, Brexit could lead to additional political, legal and economic instability and uncertainty in the EU, including changes in the regulatory environment, which could impact our ability to use UK law under \u201ccountry of origin\u201d rules for programming in the EU, potential trade barriers between the UK and the EU and between the UK and other countries, and potential content production quota regulations. Given that a portion of our business is conducted in the EU, including the UK, any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThese political and economic risks could create instability in any of the markets where our businesses derive revenues, which could result in a reduction of revenue or loss of investment that adversely affects our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. or Foreign Laws or Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nOur program services, filmed entertainment and online, mobile and app properties are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions in which we or our partners operate, including relating to intellectual property, content regulation, user privacy, data protection, anti-corruption, repatriation of profits, tax regimes, quotas, tariffs or other trade barriers, currency exchange controls, operating license and permit requirements, restrictions on foreign ownership or investment, export and market access restrictions, and exceptions and limitations on copyright and censorship, among others.\nLaws in some non-U.S. jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S., and the enforcement of such laws can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which could impact our ability to expand our operations and undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business.\nThe U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our businesses. Our Nickelodeon business in particular is subject to a number of regulations regarding children. For example, privacy regulations make it difficult to measure viewership by children. The threat of regulatory action or increased scrutiny that deters certain advertisers from advertising or reaching their intended audiences could adversely affect advertising revenue.\nOur businesses are also subject to laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which has implications for how such data is managed. For example, GDPR expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the EU and significantly increases penalties for non-compliance. Complying with these laws and regulations could be costly, require us to change our business practices, or limit or restrict aspects of our business in a manner adverse to our business operations. Many of these laws and regulations continue to evolve, and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application. Our failure to comply could result in exposure to enforcement by U.S. or foreign governments, as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage.\nOur businesses could be adversely affected by new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws, changes in interpretations of existing laws by courts and regulators and the threat that additional laws or regulations may be forthcoming, as well as our ability to enforce our legal rights. We could be required to change or limit certain of our business practices, which could impact our ability to generate revenues. We could also incur substantial costs to comply with new and existing laws and regulations, or substantial fines and penalties or other liabilities if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations.\nWe Could Be Subject to Material Liabilities as a Result of Adoption of or Changes in Tax Laws, Regulations and Administrative Practices, Interpretations and Policies\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our tax rates are impacted by the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices, interpretations and policies in the federal, state and local and international territories where our businesses operate, and these rates may be subject to significant change. Our tax returns are routinely audited and litigation, adverse outcomes, or settlements may occur because tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including our methodologies for intercompany arrangements. Additionally, shifting economic and political conditions may result in significant changes to tax policies, laws or tax rates in various jurisdictions. Such changes, litigation, adverse outcomes, or audit settlements may result in the recognition of additional charges to our income tax provision in any given period and may adversely affect our effective income tax rate or cash payments and may therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nVolatility and Weakness in Capital Markets May Adversely Affect Our Credit Availability and Related Financing Costs\nBank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, our ability to refinance, and the related cost of refinancing, some or all of our debt could be adversely affected. Although we can currently access the bank and capital markets, there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for us. In addition, our access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by our short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by ratings agencies. In addition, the interest rates included in certain agreements that govern certain of our debt securities and/or credit facilities may be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). In the future, use of LIBOR may be discontinued and we cannot be certain how long LIBOR will continue to be a viable benchmark interest rate. Use of alternative interest rates could result in increased borrowing costs or volatility in the markets and interest rates. These factors, including the tightening of credit markets, or a decrease in our debt ratings, could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing.\nOur Ongoing Investment in New Businesses, Products, Services and Technologies Through Acquisitions and Other Strategic Initiatives Present Many Risks, and We May Not Realize the Financial and Strategic Goals We Had Contemplated, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nWe have acquired and invested, and expect to continue to acquire and invest, in new businesses, products, services and technologies as part of our ongoing efforts to transition to next-generation platforms and solutions and diversify beyond our core business. Such acquisitions and strategic initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management attention from current operations; insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the new investments; failure to achieve projected synergies, cost savings or cash flow from acquired businesses, which are based on projections that are inherently uncertain; unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities; difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel, technologies and systems of acquired businesses and, in the case of foreign acquisitions, integrating operations across different cultures and languages and addressing the particular currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; the potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired businesses; and a failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology.\nBecause new investments are inherently risky, and the anticipated benefits or value of these investments may not materialize, no assurance can be given that such investments and other strategic alternatives will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe Could Be Adversely Affected by Strikes and Other Union Activity\nWe and our business partners engage the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Some of our collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. In the U.S., the industry-wide collective bargaining agreement with musicians will expire in November 2019, and agreements with writers, directors and performers will expire in 2020. In addition, any labor disputes may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and we may not be able to negotiate favorable terms for a renewal, which could increase our costs.\nOur Revenues, Expenses and Operating Results May Vary Based on the Timing, Mix, Number and Availability of Our Films and Other Programming and on Seasonal Factors\nOur revenues, expenses and operating results fluctuate due to the timing, mix, number and availability of our theatrical films, home entertainment releases and programs for licensing. For example, our operating results may increase or decrease during a particular period relative to the corresponding period in the prior year due to differences in the number and/or mix of films released and the timing of delivery of programming to television and digital distributors. Our operating results also fluctuate due to the timing of the recognition of marketing expenses, which are typically largely incurred prior to the release of films, with the recognition of related revenues in later periods.\nOur business also has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal advertising patterns and seasonal influences on audiences\u2019 viewing habits and attendance. Typically, our revenue from advertising is highest in the first quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season, among other factors, and revenue from films is highest in the summer. The effects of these variances make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter.\nRisks Relating to National Amusements\u2019 Voting Control of Viacom and CBS\nThrough National Amusements\u2019 Voting Control of Us and CBS, Certain Directors and Stockholders May Face Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest, and National Amusements is in a Position to Control Actions that Require, or May be Accomplished by, Stockholder Approval\nNational Amusements, Inc. (\u201cNAI\u201d or \u201cNational Amusements\u201d), directly and indirectly, is the controlling stockholder of both Viacom and CBS. National Amusements owns shares in Viacom representing approximately 79.8% of the voting interest in Viacom and approximately 10% of Viacom\u2019s combined common stock. National Amusements is controlled by Sumner M. Redstone, our Chairman Emeritus, who is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of National Amusements, through the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust (the \u201cSMR Trust\u201d), which owns shares in National Amusements representing 80% of the voting interest of National Amusements. The shares representing the other 20% of the voting interest of National Amusements are held through a trust controlled by Shari E. Redstone, who is Mr. Redstone\u2019s daughter, the non-executive Vice Chair of Viacom\u2019s Board of Directors, the non-executive Vice Chair of CBS\u2019 board of directors, and the President and a member of the Board of Directors of National Amusements. The shares of National Amusements held by the SMR Trust are voted solely by Mr. Redstone until such time as his incapacity or death. Upon Mr. Redstone\u2019s incapacity or death, Ms. Redstone will also become a trustee of the SMR Trust and the shares of National Amusements held by the SMR Trust will be voted by the trustees of the SMR Trust. The current trustees include Mr. Redstone, who is also a member of the Board of Directors of National Amusements and serves as Chairman Emeritus of CBS.\nThe National Amusements ownership structure and the common directors among National Amusements, Viacom and CBS could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the directors and controlling stockholder of the commonly controlled entities face decisions that could have different implications for each entity. For example, potential conflicts of interest, or the appearance thereof, could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and CBS, or when we and CBS enter into any commercial arrangements with each other, despite review by our directors not affiliated with CBS. In addition, National Amusements\u2019 voting control of us allows it to control the outcome of corporate actions that require, or may be accomplished by, stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, stockholder-proposed amendments to our bylaws, mergers and transactions involving a change in control. For so long as National Amusements retains voting control of us, our stockholders other than National Amusements will be unable to affect the outcome of any corporate actions. The interests of National Amusements may not be the same as the interests of our other stockholders, who must rely on our independent directors to represent their interests.\nSee also \u201cRisks Relating to the Pending Merger with CBS-NAI, through Its Voting Control Of ViacomCBS, Will Be in\na Position To Control Actions That Require Stockholder Approval.\u201d\nOur Certificate of Incorporation Could Prevent Us from Benefiting from Corporate Opportunities that Might Otherwise Have Been Available to Us\nOur certificate of incorporation and the certificate of incorporation of CBS both contain provisions related to corporate opportunities that may be of interest to both us and to CBS. Our certificate of incorporation provides that in the event that a\ndirector, officer or controlling stockholder of Viacom who is also a director, officer or controlling stockholder of CBS acquires knowledge of a potential corporate opportunity for both Viacom and CBS, such director, officer or controlling stockholder may present such opportunity to Viacom or CBS or both, as such director, officer or controlling stockholder deems appropriate in his or her sole discretion, and that by doing so such person will have satisfied his or her fiduciary duties, and shall not be liable, to Viacom or its stockholders. In addition, Viacom\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides that Viacom renounces any interest in any such opportunity presented to CBS. These provisions create the possibility that CBS could have access to corporate opportunities from which Viacom could benefit in addition to, or instead of, CBS, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUpon closing of the merger, the above provisions will no longer be applicable at the effective time of the merger and ViacomCBS will be governed by the amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \u201cA&R Charter\u201d), which is attached as an exhibit to the merger agreement incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe, National Amusements and CBS, and our Respective Businesses, Are Attributable to Each Other for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities or Impose Additional Costs\nSo long as we, National Amusements and CBS are under common control, each company\u2019s businesses, as well as the businesses of any other commonly controlled company, may be attributable to the other companies for purposes of U.S. and non-U.S. antitrust rules and regulations, certain rules and regulations of the FCC, certain rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and certain rules regarding political campaign contributions in the U.S., among others. The businesses of each company may continue to be attributable to the other companies for FCC and other purposes even after the companies cease to be commonly controlled, if the companies share common officers, directors, or attributable stockholders. As a result, the businesses and conduct of any of these other companies may have the effect of limiting the activities or strategic business alternatives available to us, including limitations to which we contractually agreed in connection with our separation from CBS, or may impose additional costs on us.\nRisks Relating to the Pending Merger with CBS\nAs previously announced, on August 13, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with CBS, pursuant to which, subject to customary closing conditions, we will merge with and into CBS, with CBS surviving as the surviving corporation, which will be named ViacomCBS Inc. A joint consent solicitation statement/prospectus on Form S-4 was filed with the SEC and declared effective on October 25, 2019 and we expect to close the merger in early December 2019.\nBecause the Market Price of CBS Common Stock Will Fluctuate, Viacom Stockholders Cannot Be Sure of the Value of ViacomCBS Common Stock They Will Receive in the Merger. In Addition, because the Exchange Ratio Is Fixed, the Number of Shares of ViacomCBS Common Stock to Be Received by Viacom Stockholders in the Merger Will Not Change between Now and the Time the Merger Is Completed to Reflect Changes in the Trading Prices of CBS Common Stock or Viacom Common Stock\nAs a result of the merger, each share of Viacom Class A common stock and each share of Viacom Class B common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or by CBS) will be converted automatically into 0.59625 shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock and 0.59625 shares of ViacomCBS Class B common stock, respectively. The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted prior to the closing to account for changes in the trading prices of CBS common stock or Viacom common stock or, except as otherwise set forth in the merger agreement, other factors. The exact value of the consideration to Viacom stockholders will therefore depend on the price per share of CBS common stock at the closing of the merger, which may be greater than, less than or the same as the price per share of CBS common stock at the time of entry into the merger agreement.\nThe market price of CBS common stock is subject to general price fluctuations in the market for publicly traded equity securities and has experienced volatility in the past. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in the business, operations and prospects of CBS or Viacom and regulatory considerations, many of which are factors beyond CBS\u2019 and Viacom\u2019s control.\nWe Will Be Subject to Business Uncertainties and Contractual Restrictions While the Merger Is Pending\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, commercial partners, clients and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause customers and others that deal with us to defer or decline entering into contracts with us or making other decisions concerning us or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Certain of our contracts contain change of control restrictions that may give rise to a right of termination or cancellation in connection with the merger. In addition, if key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of the merger, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, the merger agreement contains restrictions on our ability to take certain actions outside the ordinary course of business prior to the closing of the merger, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking certain actions or business opportunities that may arise prior to the closing. For more information, see the merger agreement incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Merger Agreement Limits Our Ability to Pursue Alternatives to the Merger\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to enter into alternative transactions. The merger agreement contains certain provisions that restrict our ability to, among other things, solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal from a third party. For more information, see the merger agreement incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, upon the receipt of the Viacom stockholder approval on October 28, 2019, our right to terminate the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal was eliminated. While we believe these provisions are reasonable and customary, the provisions might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing such acquisition, even if such party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per-share value than the currently proposed merger consideration.\nFailure to Complete the Merger Could Negatively Impact Our Business, Financial Results and Stock Price\nIf the merger is not completed, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks and consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay CBS a termination fee of $373,000,000;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such as significant fees and expenses relating to financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses, employee-benefit and related expenses, regulatory filings and filing and printing fees; and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which could otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our employees, commercial partners, clients and customers. We could also be subject to litigation, including litigation related to failure to complete the merger or to enforce CBS\u2019 obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materially affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nFor a description of the circumstances under which a termination fee is payable, see the merger agreement incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger May Be Filed against Our Board of Directors and/or Our Special Committee That Could Prevent or Delay the Closing of the Merger and/or Result in the Payment of Damages Following the Closing\nIn connection with the merger, it is possible that our stockholders may file putative class action lawsuits against our Board of Directors and/or our special committee. Among other remedies, these stockholders could seek damages and/or to enjoin the merger. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and any such potential lawsuits could prevent or delay the closing and/or result in substantial costs to us. Any such actions may create uncertainty relating to the merger and may be costly and\ndistracting to management. Further, the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed may adversely affect ViacomCBS\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Shares of ViacomCBS Common Stock to Be Received by Viacom Stockholders upon the Closing Will Have Different Rights from Shares of Viacom Common Stock\nUpon the closing, our stockholders will no longer be stockholders of Viacom. Instead, our former stockholders will become ViacomCBS stockholders and their rights as ViacomCBS stockholders will be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware and the terms of the A&R Charter and the amended and restated bylaws of the combined company (the \u201cA&R Bylaws\u201d). The A&R Charter and A&R Bylaws of the combined company are in some respects materially different than the terms of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which currently govern the rights of our stockholders. See the form A&R Charter and form A&R Bylaws attached as exhibits to the merger agreement incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlthough We Expect That the Merger Will Result in Synergies and Other Benefits, Those Synergies and Benefits May Not Be Realized or May Not Be Realized within the Expected Time Frame\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend, to a large extent, on ViacomCBS\u2019 ability to integrate our and CBS\u2019 businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. Even if ViacomCBS is able to integrate the two companies successfully, the anticipated benefits of the merger, including the expected synergies, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur Business May Not Be Integrated Successfully or Such Integration May Be More Difficult, Time Consuming or Costly Than Expected. Operating Costs, Customer Loss and Business Disruption, Including Difficulties in Maintaining Relationships with Employees, Customers, Suppliers or Vendors, May Be Greater Than Expected Following the Merger. Revenues Following the Merger May Be Lower Than Expected\nThe combination of two independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming and may divert significant management attention and resources to combining our and CBS\u2019 business practices and operations. This process may disrupt our business. The failure to meet the challenges involved in combining the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of ViacomCBS and could adversely affect the results of operations of ViacomCBS. The overall combination of our and CBS\u2019 businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customer and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems;\n\u2022\nchallenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel, including talent;\n\u2022\nchallenges in retaining existing, and obtaining new customers, viewers, suppliers, distributors, licensors, lessors, employees, business associates and others, including material content providers, studios, authors, producers, directors, actors and other talents, guilds and advertisers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, accretion targets, business opportunities, financing plans and growth prospects from the combination;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\nchallenges in continuing to develop valuable and widely-accepted content and technologies;\n\u2022\ncontingent liabilities that are larger than expected; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and/or will be outside the control of ViacomCBS, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of ViacomCBS. In addition, even if the operations of our and CBS\u2019 businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the merger may not be realized, including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and CBS\u2019 businesses. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of ViacomCBS, decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the merger, and negatively impact the price of the ViacomCBS common stock following the merger. As a result, it cannot be assured that the combination of us and CBS will result in the realization of the full benefits expected from the merger within the anticipated time frames or at all.\nWe Have Incurred, and Will Incur, Substantial Direct and Indirect Costs as a Result of the Merger\nWe have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the merger, including financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses, employee-benefit and related expenses, regulatory filings and filing and printing fees. In addition, over a period of time following the closing, ViacomCBS is also expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating and coordinating the businesses, operations, policies and procedures of us and CBS. A portion of the transaction costs related to the merger will be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses will exceed the costs historically borne by us. These costs could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of us prior to the merger and of ViacomCBS following the merger.\nThe Market Price for ViacomCBS Common Stock Following the Closing of the Merger May Be Affected by Factors Different from Those That Historically Have Affected or Currently Affect Our Common Stock\nUpon the closing of the merger, our stockholders will receive shares of ViacomCBS common stock. ViacomCBS\u2019 business and financial position will differ from our business and financial position before the closing and, accordingly, the results of operations of ViacomCBS will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting our results of operations. Accordingly, the market price and performance of ViacomCBS common stock is likely to be different from the performance of our common stock in the absence of the merger. In addition, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, ViacomCBS common stock, regardless of ViacomCBS\u2019 actual operating performance.\nThe Merger May Not Be Accretive and May Cause Dilution to the Earnings per Share of ViacomCBS, Which May Negatively Affect the Market Price of the ViacomCBS Common Stock\nIn the merger, based on the estimated number of shares of CBS common stock and Viacom common stock that are expected to be outstanding immediately prior to the closing, it is anticipated that CBS will issue approximately 243 million shares of ViacomCBS common stock. The issuance of these new shares could have the effect of depressing the market price of the ViacomCBS common stock. In addition, we (or ViacomCBS after the merger) could encounter other transaction-related costs, such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger, which could cause dilution to ViacomCBS\u2019 earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the market price of the ViacomCBS common stock.\nNAI, through Its Voting Control of ViacomCBS, Will Be in a Position to Control Actions That Require Stockholder Approval\nNAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of ViacomCBS Class A common stock, will have voting control of ViacomCBS. Immediately following the closing, NAI is expected to directly or indirectly own approximately 79.4% of the shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock outstanding, and approximately 10.1% of the shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock\nand ViacomCBS Class B common stock outstanding on a combined basis (and based on fully diluted shares outstanding of ViacomCBS, including restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and exercisable options). Mr. Redstone is the beneficial owner of the controlling interest in NAI and, accordingly, beneficially owns all such shares. Mr. Redstone serves as Chairman Emeritus of our Board of Directors but will not serve as an officer or director of ViacomCBS following the closing, and Ms. Redstone will serve as non-executive Chair of the ViacomCBS board of directors. NAI is controlled by Mr. Redstone through the SMR Trust, which owns 80% of the voting interest of NAI, and such voting interest of NAI held by the SMR Trust is voted solely by Mr. Redstone until his incapacity or death. The SMR Trust provides that in the event of Mr. Redstone\u2019s death or incapacity, voting control of the NAI voting interest held by the SMR Trust will pass to seven trustees, who will include the non-executive Chair of the ViacomCBS board of directors, Ms. Shari E. Redstone. No member of ViacomCBS\u2019 management is a trustee of the SMR Trust.\nSubject to the terms of the Governance Agreement dated as of August 13, 2019, which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, NAI will be in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require, or may be accomplished by, stockholder approval, including amending the A&R Bylaws, the election or removal of directors and transactions involving a change of control. For example, the A&R Bylaws will provide that:\n\u2022\nthe affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of ViacomCBS then entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, is required for the ViacomCBS stockholders to amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any bylaws of ViacomCBS;\n\u2022\nany or all of the directors of ViacomCBS may be removed from office at any time prior to the expiration of his or her term of office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of outstanding shares representing at least a majority of all the aggregate voting power of outstanding shares of ViacomCBS common stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class at a special meeting of the ViacomCBS stockholders called expressly for that purpose; provided that during the two-year period following the closing date, the removal of the Chief Executive Officer of ViacomCBS requires the approval of the ViacomCBS board of directors by the \u201cRequisite Approval\u201d (as defined in the form A&R Charter attached as an exhibit to the merger agreement incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); provided further, that during the two-year period following the closing date, NAI and NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC are not permitted to remove any other persons who are members of the ViacomCBS board of directors at the effective time in accordance with the merger agreement or who otherwise become members of the ViacomCBS board of directors (other than any of the NAI Affiliated Directors) without the Requisite Approval; and\n\u2022\nin accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), the ViacomCBS stockholders may act by written consent without a meeting if such stockholders hold the number of shares representing not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such actions at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.\nAccordingly, other ViacomCBS stockholders who may have different interests are unable to affect the outcome of any such corporate actions for so long as NAI retains voting control. For more information, see the Governance Agreement incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales of NAI\u2019s Shares of ViacomCBS Common Stock, Some of Which Are Pledged to Lenders, Could Adversely Affect the Stock Price\nImmediately following the closing of the merger, based on the estimated number of shares of CBS common stock and Viacom common stock that are expected to be outstanding immediately prior to the closing, NAI is expected to directly or indirectly own approximately 79.4% of the shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock outstanding, and approximately 10.1% of the shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock and ViacomCBS Class B common stock outstanding on a combined basis (and based on fully diluted shares outstanding of ViacomCBS, including restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and exercisable options). Based on information received from NAI, NAI is expected to pledge to its lenders shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock and ViacomCBS Class B common stock owned directly or indirectly by NAI.\nImmediately following the closing, the aggregate number of shares of ViacomCBS common stock expected to be pledged by NAI to its lenders will represent approximately 4.0% of the total outstanding shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock and ViacomCBS Class B common stock, on a combined basis (and based on fully diluted shares outstanding of ViacomCBS,\nincluding restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and exercisable options). Immediately following the closing, the amount of ViacomCBS Class A common stock that NAI is expected to directly or indirectly own and that is not expected to be pledged by NAI to its lenders is expected to represent approximately 64.0% of the total outstanding shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock (based on fully diluted shares outstanding of ViacomCBS, including restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and exercisable options).\nIf there is a default on NAI\u2019s debt obligations and the lenders foreclose on the pledged shares, the lenders may not effect a transfer, sale or disposition of any pledged shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock, unless such shares have first been converted into ViacomCBS Class B common stock. A sale of the pledged shares could adversely affect the ViacomCBS common stock share price.\nAdditionally, if the lenders foreclose on the pledged shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock, NAI will no longer directly or indirectly own those shares and such lenders would have voting rights in ViacomCBS, unless and until such time as such lenders convert such shares into ViacomCBS Class B common stock in order to sell or transfer the shares. In addition, there can be no assurance that at some future time NAI will not sell or pledge additional shares of ViacomCBS common stock, which could adversely affect the ViacomCBS common stock share price.\nThe A&R Bylaws Will Designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the Sole and Exclusive Forum for Certain Types of Actions and Proceedings That May Be Initiated by ViacomCBS Stockholders (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware Lacks Subject Matter Jurisdiction, Any State or Federal Court Located within the State of Delaware), Which Could Discourage Lawsuits against ViacomCBS and Its Directors, Officers and Employees\nUnder the A&R Bylaws, unless the ViacomCBS board of directors consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any state or federal court located within the State of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of ViacomCBS;\n\u2022\nany action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of ViacomCBS to ViacomCBS or to the ViacomCBS stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action or proceeding asserting a claim against ViacomCBS or any director or officer of ViacomCBS arising pursuant to, or seeking to enforce any right, obligation, or remedy under, any provision of the DGCL, the A&R Charter or the A&R Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time);\n\u2022\nany action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of any provision or provisions of the A&R Charter or the A&R Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time), or any amendment thereto or modification thereof; and\n\u2022\nany action or proceeding asserting a claim against ViacomCBS or any director or officer of ViacomCBS governed by the internal affairs doctrine; or any action or proceeding to determine the result of any vote or action by written consent of stockholders.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision will apply to state and federal law claims although the ViacomCBS stockholders will not be deemed to have waived ViacomCBS\u2019 compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 bylaws has been challenged in legal proceedings, and the Delaware courts have held that such provisions are valid as they relate to internal affairs claims, such as claims alleging breaches of fiduciary duty or violations of the DGCL, a certificate of incorporation, or bylaws, but are not valid to govern external claims, including claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of the ViacomCBS stockholders to commence litigation in a forum that they prefer, which may discourage such lawsuits against ViacomCBS and its current or former directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, ViacomCBS may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 91066, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "VIAB"}
