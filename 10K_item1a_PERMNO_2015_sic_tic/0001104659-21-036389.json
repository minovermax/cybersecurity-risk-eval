You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe following summary risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The summary risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also affect our business operations or financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our stock price, business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. For more information, see below for more detailed descriptions of each risk factor.\n\u00b7 General business and economic conditions, and risk to the larger automotive ecosystem, including consumer demand, could adversely affect the market for used vehicles.\n\u00b7 We may not be able to execute on our geographic expansion strategy.\n\u00b7 Vehicle sellers may not be willing to consign their vehicles with us for sale.\n\u00b7 We have a history of losses and may not be able to maintain profitability in the future.\n\u00b7 We may be unable to sustain our revenue growth and effectively manage growth.\n\u00b7 We participate in a highly competitive industry and face pressure from existing and new companies.\n\u00b7 Our advertising activities may fail to efficiently drive growth in units sourced from corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers as well as units sold to buyers.\n\u00b7 Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 outbreak.\n\u00b7 Our ability to expand our product offerings and introduce additional products and services may be limited.\n\u00b7 We may experience damage or destruction to the vehicles consigned us, or our processing centers or retail hubs, business interruptions or other liabilities.\n\u00b7 Our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles.\n\u00b7 Our transformation into a listed public company will increase costs and may disrupt the regular operations of our business.\n\u00b7 We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nGeneral business and economic conditions, and risk to the larger automotive ecosystem, including consumer demand, could adversely affect the market for used vehicles, which could reduce our revenue and profitability.\nThe market for used vehicles in the U.S. is affected by general business and economic conditions, especially as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. economy is currently experiencing a period of instability, and this volatility may result in reduced demand for our services, consigned and purchased vehicles and value-added products, reduced spending on vehicles, the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of vehicles, and decreased consumer confidence to make discretionary purchases, which will generally correspond to decreased consignment of vehicles as most vehicles are consigned to us in connection with a purchase of a replacement vehicle by the seller. Consumer purchases of vehicles and the consignment of vehicles for sale generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected.\nPurchases of used vehicles and the consignment of vehicles for sale are typically discretionary for consumers and have been, and may continue to be, affected by negative trends in the economy and other factors, including rising interest rates, the cost of energy and gasoline, the availability and cost of consumer credit and reductions in consumer confidence. Fears of recession, stock market volatility, increased regulation and increased unemployment as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may reduce our revenue.\nIn the event of a sustained revenue decline suffered by participants in the automotive markets, our competitors and car manufacturers may attempt to increase their sales by offering increased trade-in values for vehicles, reducing prices or increasing marketing expenditures, each of which may cause potential vehicle sourcing partners to perceive that there are higher value alternatives to consigning their vehicles for sale by us. Additionally, increases in unemployment rates may increase the number of loan and lease defaults, leading to repossessions, which are typically then re-sold by lenders in the wholesale market, which also reduces vehicles available for consignment and may also depress used car values.\nA prolonged economic downturn that results in reduced demand for our services, vehicles and product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to increase revenues and grow our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to execute our geographic expansion strategy.\nThe geographic expansion of our physical footprint is a critical component of our plans to increase our revenues and grow our business. As part of our growth plan, we need to locate, lease and establish desirable locations for our new retail hubs. The success of our geographic expansion strategy depends on a number of factors, including the identification of desirable locations that meet our standards, negotiation of acceptable lease terms while securing those favorable locations, including desired term, rent and tenant improvement allowances and, if entering a new market, the timely achievement of brand awareness and proper evaluation of the market. If we are unable to open and operate new retail hubs, if it takes us longer than anticipated to open such hubs or if the retail hubs we open are unprofitable or otherwise unsuccessful, our ability to increase revenues and grow our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe participate in a highly competitive industry, and pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs described in greater detail in \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d our business is involved in the sourcing and sale of used vehicles. Used and new car dealerships and companies that provide listings, information and lead generation, as well as car-buying and car-selling services designed to help potential vehicle sellers and buyers and to enable dealers to reach these vehicle sellers and buyers, are sources of significant competition to our business. Some of these companies include:\n\u00b7 traditional used vehicle dealerships, including those that may increase investment in their technology and infrastructure in order to compete directly with our omni-channel consignment-to-retail business model;\n\u00b7 large national car dealers, such as CarMax and AutoNation, which are expanding into online sales, including omni-channel offerings;\n\u00b7 on-line and physical auction businesses, such as ADESA, Manheim, ACV, BackLotCars and several smaller independent auctions that compete with us for the supply of our vehicles;\n\u00b7 used car dealers or marketplaces with e-commerce business or online platforms such as Carvana, Vroom and Shift; and\n\u00b7 the peer-to-peer used vehicle sales market, utilizing sites such as Google, Facebook, Craiglist.com, eBay Motors and Nextdoor.com.\nWe also expect that new competitors will continue to enter the online and traditional automotive retail industry with competing brands, business models, products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetitors may also attempt to replicate our business model and compete directly with us for the sourcing and sale of used vehicles. These competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and support of their products and services. Additionally, they may have more extensive automotive industry relationships, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly with new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. If we are unable to compete with these companies, the demand for our services could substantially decline.\nOur business model relies on the willingness of sellers to consign their vehicles with us and in attracting effective sales and customer service professionals.\nOur business depends on our ability to cost-effectively attract, retain and grow relationships with corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers and, in turn, on the supply of used vehicles sold through our marketplace. For the year ended December 31, 2020, two of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, with whom we do not have long-term consignment contracts, accounted for over 40% of the cars we sold. Furthermore, for the fourth quarter of 2020 and continuing during the first quarter of 2021 to date, one of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners has accounted for over 60% of our vehicles sourced. To expand our consignment base, we must appeal to and contract with local and regional corporate accounts, as well as national accounts as we expand our geographic footprint, further penetrate existing corporate vehicle sourcing partners\u2019 accounts and engage individuals who may be unfamiliar with our consignment-to-retail marketplace. Our strategy is to leverage our existing relationships to further penetrate existing corporate vehicle sourcing partners and rely on a variety of methods to scale our business in new markets, including traditional advertising, retail signage, targeted sales efforts and word-of-mouth. Although our strategy is to increase our brand marketing efforts as we expand geographically, we cannot be certain that these efforts will yield more corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers or be cost-effective.\nTo accomplish the foregoing goal, we rely on our sales and customer service employees to drive our supply of used vehicles by identifying, developing and maintaining relationships with our corporate vehicle sourcing partners. The process of identifying and hiring sales and customer service professionals with the combination of skills and attributes required can be difficult and require significant commitment of time. In addition, competition for qualified employees and personnel in the retail vehicle industry is intense and turnover among our sales and customer service professionals within a few years is not uncommon. Any shortage in sales and customer service professionals or delay in identifying and hiring quality sales and customer service professionals could have a negative impact on our business. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining effective sales and customer service professionals, the quantity and quality of our vehicle consignments may be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have experienced net losses of $6.8 million, $12.7 million and $6.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect to make significant investments to further develop and expand our business, and these investments may not result in increased revenue or growth on a timely basis or at all. We may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If our revenue growth does not meet our expectations in future periods, our financial performance may be adversely affected, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. In addition, as a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. As a result of these increased expenditures, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to maintain profitability.\nWe may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate or effectively manage growth.\nOur revenue grew from $58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In the future, even if our revenue increases, our rate of growth may decline. In any event, we will not be able to grow as rapidly or at all if we do not:\n\u00b7 successfully open additional retail hubs and increase our geographic footprint;\n\u00b7 innovate and expand our technological leadership;\n\u00b7 further penetrate our existing accounts and key vehicle channels;\n\u00b7 add corporate vehicle sourcing partners;\n\u00b7 successfully market our brand; and\n\u00b7 increase our service offerings and price optimization.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these objectives. As we continue to grow, we expect to invest substantial financial and other resources to:\n\u00b7 expand into new geographic markets;\n\u00b7 invest in our core suite of technology as well as various retail and processing enhancements;\n\u00b7 invest in brand marketing and advertising; and\n\u00b7 incur general administration, including legal, accounting and other compliance, expenses related to being a public company.\nOur historical growth and projected growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and on our operational and financial resources. Our business strategy involves significant growth in number of hubs, geographic footprint and the number of corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers selling and buying cars through our platform. We have hired and expect to continue hiring additional personnel to support our planned growth. Our organizational structure is becoming more complex as we add staff, and we will need to improve our operational, legal, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We will require significant capital expenditures and the investment of valuable management resources to grow and develop in these areas without undermining our corporate culture of rapid innovation, teamwork and attention to the car buying and selling experience for our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers. A failure to manage our growth effectively to maintain the quality and efficiency of the car selling experience for our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and the quality of the vehicles we sell to our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business has grown rapidly as additional corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers have consigned cars to us and we have sold used cars and complementary products and services to customers through our platform. However, our business has operated at substantial scale for only a limited period of time. Given this limited history, it is difficult to predict whether we will be able to maintain or grow our business, and our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We also expect that our business will evolve in ways that may be difficult to predict. For example, over time our investments in new geographic markets and in our product offerings may be less productive than expected or be subject to unknown risks. An inability to adjust our strategy to meet changing market conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOne or more of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners may represent 10% or more of our total vehicles consigned, and at times significantly more, in the normal course of our vehicle sourcing.\nOne or more of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners will often represent 10% or more of the vehicles we source over a particular period. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020, two of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, with whom we do not have long-term consignment contracts, accounted for over 40% of the cars we sold. Furthermore, for the fourth quarter of 2020 and continuing during the first quarter of 2021 to date, one of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners has accounted for over 60% of our vehicles sourced. Over time, we may have concentrations of 10% or more for a number of reasons, and the concentrations will often vary among corporate vehicle sourcing partners. Some corporate vehicle sourcing partners may make a supply of vehicles available at certain times of a given year, while others may increase or decrease their flow of vehicles for a number of reasons, including the performance of their business or prevailing business considerations and economic conditions.\nFurthermore, at times, we may source a significantly higher portion of our consigned vehicles from one or more corporate vehicle sourcing partners. Such concentrations can result from a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. During any given time period, we may elect to source a higher percentage of vehicles from one or more corporate vehicle sourcing partners for a variety of reasons, including the availability of specific vehicle makes and models.\nSourcing a significant portion of our consigned vehicles from a limited number of corporate vehicle sourcing partners exposes us to a number of risks. Our agreements with our corporate vehicle sourcing partners are generally subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. Generally, corporate vehicle sourcing partners make non-binding long-term commitments to us regarding consignment volumes. If a corporate vehicle sourcing partner from which we are sourcing a significant portion of our vehicles were to cease or significantly reduce making vehicles available to us, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as we would likely need to increase our sourcing of vehicles from other vehicle sourcing partners potentially on less favorable terms and conditions. Such an effort may take a number of months and may not precisely replicate the variety and quality of vehicles we have been sourcing from this single source. Further, we could be required to increase our purchasing of vehicles to maintain optimal inventory levels and mix as we work to increase vehicle supply from other vehicle sourcing partners, which could negatively affect our margins and gross profit per vehicle. Furthermore, having a high concentration of vehicles in our inventory on consignment from a single corporate vehicle sourcing partner could indirectly expose us to credit risk with respect to that corporate vehicle sourcing partner as we may be restricted from selling those vehicles or realizing profits on the sale of those vehicles in the event of that corporate vehicle sourcing partner\u2019s insolvency.\nOur advertising activities may fail to efficiently drive growth in units sourced from corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers as well as units sold to buyers.\nOur future growth and success will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising, promotion, public relations and marketing programs, and we plan to increase our investment in these activities as we expand geographically. These brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and the efficacy of these activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to do the following:\n\u00b7 determine the effective creative message and media mix for advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures;\n\u00b7 select the right markets, media and specific media vehicles in which to advertise;\n\u00b7 identify the most effective and efficient level of spending for each market, media and specific media vehicle; and\n\u00b7 effectively manage marketing costs, including creative and media expenses, to maintain acceptable corporate vehicle sourcing partner, retail seller and buyer acquisition costs.\nWe expect to increase advertising spending in future periods to continue driving our growth. Increases in the pricing of one or more of our marketing and advertising channels could increase our marketing and advertising expenses or cause us to choose less expensive but possibly less effective marketing and advertising channels. If we implement new marketing and advertising strategies, we may incur significantly higher costs than our current channels, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operating results.\nImplementing new marketing and advertising strategies also could increase the risk of devoting significant capital and other resources to endeavors that do not prove to be cost effective. We also may incur marketing and advertising expenses significantly in advance of the time we anticipate recognizing revenue associated with such expenses, and our marketing and advertising expenditures may not generate sufficient levels of brand awareness or result in increased revenue. Even if our marketing and advertising expenses result in increased sales, the increase might not offset our related increased expenditures. If we are unable to maintain our marketing and advertising channels on cost-effective terms or replace or supplement existing marketing and advertising channels with similar or more effective channels, our marketing and advertising expenses could increase substantially, and thus our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and buyers could be adversely affected, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 since late 2019 has resulted in governmental authorities implementing numerous protective measures during the ongoing pandemic, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns, to contain the spread of the virus and reduce its impact. These measures have impacted and continue to and may further impact some or all of our teammates and operations, the behavior and operations of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners and the behavior of our customers. This pandemic has significantly disrupted economies around the world, including the United States, and will likely continue to cause significant disruptions. There continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of potential future measures that may be taken to contain the virus and how those measures may in turn impact our business. While we believe our business is well positioned to take advantage of protective measures such as shelter in place orders and shutdowns, we saw a decrease in sales activity as consumers for the most part stayed home during the months of March through May of 2020 . As our sales began to return to pre-COVID-19 levels late in the second quarter of 2020, the ongoing OEM plant shut-downs and repossession moratoriums limited vehicle supply from our corporate vehicle sourcing partners through most of the third quarter. During this time, we maintained our aggressive cost cutting measures by limiting marketing expense and inventory purchases in an effort to preserve liquidity. As we exited the third quarter, we saw record consignments and inventory that led to record quarterly unit sales and revenue.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. For example, increases in unemployment and reduced access to financing and reductions in disposable income are likely to result in reduced consumer spending, including purchases of new and used cars. Additionally, disruption and volatility in the global capital markets can increase the cost of capital and adversely impact access to capital. It is also possible that the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional changes that impact the market for vehicles generally. For example, to the extent COVID-19 results in more people working remotely on a long-term basis or moving out of densely populated urban areas, vehicle usage may decline, which could adversely impact the demand for vehicles and our services.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak ultimately impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or treat its impact, among others. Additionally, the COVID-19 outbreak may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d including risks relating to general economic conditions.\nOur ability to expand our product offerings and introduce additional products and services may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, we offer third-party financing, insurance and vehicle protection products, which includes third-party financing of customers\u2019 vehicle purchases, as well as other value-added products, such as vehicle service contracts. If we introduce new value-added products or expand existing offerings, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter these markets successfully. Entry into new markets may require us to compete with new companies, cater to new corporate vehicle sourcing partner, retail seller and customer expectations and comply with new complex regulations and licensing requirements, each of which will be unfamiliar. Accordingly, we could need to invest significant resources in market research, legal counsel and our organizational infrastructure, and a return on such investments may not be achieved for several years, if at all. Additionally, failure to comply with applicable regulations or to obtain required licenses could result in penalties or fines. Further, we may fail in demonstrating the value of any new value-added product to customers, which would compromise our ability to successfully create new revenue streams or receive returns in excess of investments. Any of these risks, if realized, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience damage or destruction to the vehicles consigned to us, or our processing centers or retail hubs, business interruptions or other liabilities, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe store the vehicles consigned to us at our retail hubs until they are sold to purchasers. These vehicles may be subject to damage resulting from transportation to and out of our facilities, improper or incorrect reconditioning techniques, damage resulting from accidents during customer test drives or damage resulting from improper delivery of the vehicle to purchasers. Any damage or catastrophic loss of vehicles stored at our locations, due to natural disasters, like hail, or man-made disasters, such as theft or vandalism, arsons, accidents or otherwise, would result in liability to our corporate vehicle sourcing partners or retail sellers for the expected value of the damaged or destroyed vehicle and, depending on the scale of damage, a significant disruption to our business. In addition, we may be subject to claims by employees, corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers, customers and third parties for personal injury or property damage.\nWhile we carry insurance for all of our vehicles and the facilities in which the vehicles are stored, the insurance we carry may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and, in any event, may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our business could suffer. In the event that we suffer a catastrophic loss to one or more of our retail hubs or to the vehicles stored at our retail hubs, our liabilities may exceed the maximum insurance coverage amount, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe enter into alternative fee arrangements with certain of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, which may cause our gross profit per vehicle to fluctuate from period to period.\nIn addition to our flat fee pricing model, we enter into alternative fee arrangements with certain of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, which can include arrangements where we share a percentage of vehicle sale proceeds or customer fees with our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, and the portion of our vehicles subject to such arrangements can fluctuate significantly. Under these sharing arrangements, our gross profit for a particular unit could be higher or lower than the gross profit per unit we would realize under our flat fee pricing model depending on the unit\u2019s sale price and fees we are able to charge in connection with the sale. As we do not have binding long-term contracts with our corporate vehicle sourcing partners and do not require them to make vehicles available to us, our mix of vehicles sourced under alternative fee arrangements is likely to fluctuate over time. Our gross profit per unit is therefore likely to fluctuate from period to period, perhaps significantly, due to our sourcing partner mix as well as due to the sales prices and fees we are able to collect on the vehicles we source under alternative fee arrangements.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020 and continuing during the first quarter of 2021 to date, one of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners with whom we have an alternative fee arrangement has accounted for over 60% of our vehicles sourced. Under our fee arrangement with this corporate vehicle sourcing partner, vehicles are returned to the corporate vehicle sourcing partner from consignment if the vehicle has not been sold through our retail channel within a specified time period. In such instances, we are responsible for the expenses we have incurred with respect to the vehicle, including shipping costs and any refurbishment costs we have incurred. We have returned a number of vehicles from consignment during the first quarter of 2021 to date and expect to continue to return vehicles into the second quarter of 2021 as we seek to better match our intake of vehicles under this arrangement to our sales and reconditioning capacity. The expenses associated with these returned vehicles will reduce our gross profit during the first quarter of 2021 and for subsequent periods during which we experience such vehicle returns.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles.\nSignificant changes in retail prices for new or used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles, it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle, reducing demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing the price gap between new and used vehicles. Lower used vehicle prices could reduce the consignment of vehicles with us for sale, reducing our revenues.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with our inspection and reconditioning operations.\nWe operate our processing centers at several locations across the United States. If we are unable to operate our processing centers efficiently, we could experience delivery delays, a decrease in the quality of our reconditioning services, delays in listing our inventory, additional expenses and loss of potential and existing corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers and subsequent revenues, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021 to date and we expect to continue into the second quarter of 2021 until such time as we better match our intake of vehicles to our reconditioning capacity, we have been unable to recondition a portion of our vehicle inventory in a timely manner, which has resulted in us returning a number of vehicles from consignment as well as increasing our utilization of third party service providers, in each case incurring costs that reduce our gross profit.\nAdditionally, in certain locations, we outsource reconditioning services to third party providers. If we are unable to maintain our relationship with our third-party service providers, such service providers cease to provide the services we need or such service providers are unable to effectively deliver services to our standards on timelines and at the prices we have negotiated, and we are unable to contract with alternative vendors or replace such service providers with our in-house reconditioning specialists, we could experience delivery delays, a decrease in the quality of our reconditioning services, delays in listing vehicles consigned to us for sale and increased time to sale, additional expenses and loss of potential and existing corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers and subsequent revenues, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party carriers to transport vehicles to our customers, and we are subject to associated business risks and costs and with those of the transportation industry generally, many of which are out of our control.\nWe rely on third-party carriers to transport vehicles to our facilities as well as from our retail hubs to purchasers that elect to have their used vehicle delivered to them. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with the transportation industry such as weather, traffic patterns, local and federal regulations, vehicular crashes, gasoline prices and lack of reliability of many independent carriers. Third-party carriers who deliver vehicles to our customers could adversely affect the customer experience if they do not perform to our standards of professionalism and courtesy, which could adversely impact our business (including our reputation), financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain state laws prohibit or restrict vehicle consignment and, if additional states enact similar laws, our geographic expansion strategy and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur consignment operations are prohibited under the laws of certain states, such as South Carolina, Ohio and Kentucky. If other states enact similar laws, we could be prevented from opening retail hubs in those states or, if we are already present in those states, we could be forced to cease operations in those states. In addition, we may face risks that state and national auto dealer associations lobby other state governments to enact similar vehicle consignment laws. If a significant number of states, in particular states where we have significant operations and consignment activity, were to enact similar laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to a range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, and if we fail to comply, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, some of these laws establish either a private right of action or permit private individuals and entities to enforce the same in the name of the relevant government entity.\nOur business is and will continue to be subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, some of which are novel and without relevant precedent. Such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 state and local licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 state and local titling and registration requirements;\n\u00b7 state laws regulating the sale of motor vehicles and related products and services;\n\u00b7 federal and state laws regulating vehicle financing;\n\u00b7 federal and state consumer protection laws; and\n\u00b7 federal and state data privacy laws.\nThe federal agencies that regulate our business and have the authority to enforce such regulations and laws against us include the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. For example, the FTC has jurisdiction to investigate and enforce our compliance with certain consumer protection laws and has brought enforcement actions against auto dealers relating to a broad range of practices, including the sale and financing of value-added or add-on products. We are also subject to a variety of federal laws that may require us to incur costs in order to be in compliance with such laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA. Additionally, we are subject to regulation and audit by individual state dealer licensing authorities, state consumer protection agencies and state financial regulatory agencies and are subject to a variety of state laws. We are also subject to audit by such state regulatory authorities.\nOur marketing and disclosure regarding the sale and servicing of vehicles is regulated by federal, state and local agencies, including the FTC and state attorneys general. Some of these authorities either establish a private right of action or permit a private individual or entity to enforce on behalf of a state entity (\u201cprivate attorney general\u201d). We have in the past been subject to claims under these laws, and we may experience additional claims in the future.\nState dealer licensing authorities regulate the purchase and sale of used vehicles by dealers within their respective states. The applicability of these regulatory and legal compliance obligations to our e-commerce business is dependent on evolving interpretations of these laws and regulations and how our operations are, or are not, subject to them, and we may face regulatory action if regulators believe that we are not in compliance with such obligations. We are licensed as a dealer in each of the states in which operate one or more retail hubs, and all of our vehicle transactions are conducted under such licenses. We believe that our activities in other states are not currently subject to their vehicle dealer licensing laws, however regulators could seek to enforce those laws against us. In addition, if we determine or are instructed by state regulators that obtaining a license in another state is necessary, either due to expansion or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain such a license within the timeframe we expect or at all.\nSome states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that retail installment sellers file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state. All vehicle sale transactions and applicable retail installment financings are conducted under our state dealer licenses. As we seek to expand our operations and presence into other states, we may be required to obtain additional finance or other licenses, and we may not be able to obtain such licenses within the timeframe we expect or at all.\nAny failure to renew or maintain any of the foregoing licenses would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many aspects of our business are subject to regulatory regimes at the state and local level, and we may not have all licenses required to conduct business in every jurisdiction in which we operate. Despite our belief that we are not subject to certain licensing requirements of those state and local jurisdictions, regulators may seek to impose punitive fines for operating without a license or demand we seek a license in those state and local jurisdictions, any of which may inhibit our ability to do business in those state and local jurisdictions, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to the purchase, consignment and sale of used vehicles, our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, occupational health and safety and other broadly applicable business regulations. Increased environmental regulation may in the future limit the sale of the used vehicles that we sell or make it more expensive and less desirable for customers. We also are subject to laws and regulations involving taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, pricing, content protection, credit and financing, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, consumer protection, information reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our platform, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and the Nasdaq listing rules. The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations.\nThe foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to evolving interpretations and continuous change.\nIf we do not adequately address the shift to mobile device technology by our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers, our operating results could be harmed and our growth could be negatively affected.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to provide adequate functionality for visitors who use mobile devices to shop for used cars and the number of transactions with us that are completed by those users on those devices. The shift to mobile technology by our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers may harm our business in the following ways:\n\u00b7 corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers visiting our website from a mobile device may not accept mobile technology as a viable long-term platform to buy or sell a vehicle. This may occur for a number of reasons, including our ability to provide the same level of website functionality to a mobile device that we provide on a desktop computer, the actual or perceived lack of security of information on a mobile device and possible disruptions of service or connectivity;\n\u00b7 we may not continue to innovate and introduce enhanced products that can be suitably conveyed on mobile platforms;\n\u00b7 consumers using mobile devices may believe that our competitors offer superior products and features based in part on our inability to provide sufficient website functionality to convince a mobile device user to transact with us; or\n\u00b7 regulations related to consumer finance disclosures, including the Truth in Lending Act, may be interpreted, in the context of mobile devices, in a manner that could expose us to legal liability in the event we are found to have violated applicable laws.\nIf we do not develop suitable functionality for users who visit our website using a mobile device, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur business is sensitive to conditions affecting automobile manufacturers generally, including vehicle recalls.\nAdverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles. In addition, manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence that have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years. Recalls and the increased regulatory scrutiny surrounding selling used vehicles with open safety recalls could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations, could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory, could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may require additional debt and equity capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, and if such capital is not available, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including to expand into additional markets, increase our marketing expenditures to improve our brand awareness, enhance our technology, develop new products or services or further improve existing products and services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders could experience significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with identifying, leasing and dedicating capital expenditure for new locations.\nWe are required to obtain approvals, permits and licenses from state regulators and local municipalities to construct or renovate and operate our retail hubs. We may face delays in obtaining the requisite approvals, permits and licenses to renovate and operate our retail hubs or we may not be able to obtain them at all. If we encounter delays in obtaining or cannot obtain the requisite approvals, permits and licenses to renovate and operate our retail hubs in desirable locations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nA significant disruption in service on our website could damage our reputation and result in a loss of corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers, which could harm our business, brand, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers depend in large part on the reliable performance of our website and the supporting systems, technology and infrastructure. We may experience significant interruptions with our systems in the future. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, programming or configuration errors, computer viruses, or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the availability of our inventory on our website and prevent or inhibit the ability of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers to access our website. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation, result in a loss of corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers and result in additional costs.\nThe communications, network and hardware to operate our website are provided to us by a third-party service provider and exist in fully redundant environments. In addition, we do not own or control the operation of these facilities. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes and similar events. The occurrence of any of these events could damage our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail.\nProblems faced by our third party web hosting providers could adversely affect the experience of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers. For example, our third party web hosting providers could close their facilities without adequate notice. Any financial difficulties, up to and including bankruptcy, faced by our third party web hosting providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. If our third party web hosting providers are unable to keep up with our growing capacity needs, our business could be harmed.\nAny errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance or reliability problems with our network operations could interrupt our customers\u2019 access to inventory and cause delays and result in additional expense in arranging access to new facilities and services, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third party technology to complete critical business functions, and if that technology fails to adequately serve our needs and we cannot find alternatives, it may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on third party technology for certain of our critical business functions, including customer identity verification for financing, network infrastructure for hosting our website and inventory data, software libraries and development environments and tools, and services to allow corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers to digitally sign contracts. If these technologies fail or we cannot maintain our relationships with the technology providers and we cannot find suitable alternatives, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be adversely affected.\nWe believe our success depends on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our key employees or senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Michael W. Bor, could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Most of our staff are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace. We do not, and do not currently expect to have in the future, \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on the lives of any member of our senior management. We may not be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur continued success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to the demands of consumers and other constituents within the automotive industry as well as competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u00b7 diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u00b7 coordination of technology, research and development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u00b7 transition of the acquired company\u2019s users to our website and mobile applications;\n\u00b7 retention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u00b7 cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u00b7 integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u00b7 the need to implement or improve controls, policies and procedures at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, policies and procedures;\n\u00b7 potential write-offs of intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect our operating results;\n\u00b7 liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u00b7 litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, consumers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions and investments could result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and otherwise harm our business. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize. Any of these risks, if realized, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various litigation matters from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class actions, by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings or by other entities. These claims could be asserted under a variety of laws, including but not limited to consumer finance laws, consumer protection laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, labor and employment laws, securities laws and employee benefit laws. These actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business.\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal control to remediate our material weakness over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations, meet our reporting obligations as a public company or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the trading prices of our securities may be materially and adversely affected.\nPrior to the Merger, CarLotz Group, Inc. (f/k/a CarLotz, Inc.) (\u201cFormer CarLotz\u201d) was a private company with limited internal accounting personnel and other resources to address its internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the audits of Former CarLotz' consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2019, Former CarLotz and its independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in Former CarLotz\u2019 internal control over financial reporting, which remained unremediated as of December 31, 2020 and therefore will be a material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting for periods following the consummation of the Merger on January 21, 2021 until remediated. As defined in the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weakness identified relates to (i) a lack of sufficient accounting and financial reporting resources to address internal control over financial reporting and personnel with requisite knowledge and experience in application of U.S. GAAP and SEC rules, and (ii) general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support financial reporting processes. We are in the process of implementing a number of measures to address this material weakness. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2009-\u2009Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\u201d in our Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on March 15, 2021. However, we cannot assure you that these measures will fully address the material weakness and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or that we may conclude that they have been fully remediated.\nWe are a public company subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and specifically to Section 404 thereof, which requires that we include a certification from management on the effectiveness of our internal controls in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, once we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as such term is defined in the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, as a public company, our reporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation on a timely basis or at all.\nDuring the course of documenting and testing our internal control procedures, in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404, we may identify other weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or audited from time to time, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. Generally speaking, if we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, it could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from Nasdaq, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods.\nInsurance policies may not cover all of our operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could negatively impact our business.\nWe are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to the provision of auto sales. In addition to contractual provisions limiting our liability to our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers, customers and third parties, we maintain insurance policies in such amounts and with such coverage and deductibles as required by law and that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, such insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all the liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims arising in the ordinary course of our business and current levels of insurance may not be able to be maintained or be available at economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not covered by insurance, then we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our third-party service providers are highly regulated financial institutions, and the federal and state laws related to financial services could have a direct or indirect material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have entered into agreements with various third-party financial institutions related to the financing by those institutions of our customers\u2019 vehicle purchases as well as the provision of various value-added products. Our counterparties that are financial institutions are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations related to the provision of financial services, and their ability to provide financing and other products and services could be materially limited or eliminated as a result of financial regulatory or supervisory issues as well as changes in federal or state laws, regulations or guidance related to the provision of financial services. In the event of such disruptions, our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable, in a commercially reasonable manner, to identify and enter into alternative arrangements with other institutions on substantially similar terms as those that exist with our current providers.\nMoreover, we are subject to contractual obligations requiring that we comply with, or help to facilitate compliance by our financial institution counterparties with, a broad range of regulatory requirements and obligations, including without limitation those related to sourcing partner and customer data, data security, privacy, anti-money laundering and the detection and prevention of financial crimes. The federal and state regulators responsible for implementing and enforcing these laws and regulations routinely examine our financial institution counterparties with respect to their compliance with such laws and regulations, including the extent to which these institutions\u2019 third-party relationships may present compliance risks. Despite our best efforts to comply with all applicable regulatory and contractual obligations, it is possible that there could be some perceived or actual deficiency in our ability to adequately comply with financial regulatory requirements or to serve as a contractual counterparty to a regulated financial institution. Any such perceived or actual deficiency or risk to a regulated financial institution could result in a disruption of our relationship with that institution as well as with other lenders and other financial services counterparties, which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in labor costs, including wages, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe labor costs associated with our operations, including our retail hubs, are subject to many external factors, including unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, potential collective bargaining arrangements, health insurance costs and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor legislation or other workplace regulation. From time to time, legislative proposals are made to increase the federal minimum wage in the U.S., as well as the minimum wage in a number of states and municipalities, and to reform entitlement programs, such as health insurance and paid leave programs. As minimum wages increase or related laws and regulations change, our labor costs may increase, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increases in labor costs could force us to increase prices or reduce margins, which could adversely affect our sales. If competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in our quarterly operating results are likely and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nWe expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, cash flow and net profit or loss, to vary significantly in the future based in part on, among other things, seasonal and cyclical patterns in vehicle sales in the United States. Vehicle sales generally exhibit seasonality, with sales increasing in the first calendar quarter and continuing through the end of the summer, before exhibiting a drop in the fall. This seasonality historically corresponds with the timing of income tax refunds, which can provide a primary source of funds for customers\u2019 payments on used vehicle purchases. Used vehicle prices also exhibit seasonality, with used vehicle prices depreciating at a faster rate in the last two quarters of each year and a slower rate in the first two quarters of each year.\nAdditionally, a significant portion of our expenses are fixed and do not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues. Accordingly, our results in any quarter may not indicate the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or for the full year, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful.\nWe rely on Internet search engines to help drive traffic to our website, and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results or fail to drive traffic through paid advertising, our traffic would decline and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on Internet search engines, such as Google, to drive traffic to our website. Our ability to maintain and increase the number of visitors directed to our website is not entirely within our control. Our competitors may increase their search engine optimization efforts and outbid us for search terms on various search engines, resulting in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours. Additionally, Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. If Internet search engines modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors\u2019 efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our corporate vehicle sourcing partner, retail seller and customer base could slow or our corporate vehicle sourcing partner, retail seller and customer base could decline. Internet search engine providers could provide automotive dealer and pricing information directly in search results, align with our competitors or choose to develop competing services. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website through Internet search engines could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to adverse impacts from the existence of copycat websites that attempt to defraud our potential corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers or customers.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, experience disruption in our business and adverse impacts to our brand from the posting by third parties of copycat websites that attempt to imitate the branding and functionality of our website and defraud our customers. If we become aware of such activities, we intend to employ technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt these operations. However, we may be unable to detect all such activities or operations in a timely manner and, even if we do detect such activities or operations, our attempts at implementing technological measures and seeking legal recourse from appropriate governmental authorities may be insufficient to halt these operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of entities operating outside of the U.S., our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us or our customers against the impact of the operation of such websites. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among customers, our brand and business could be materially harmed.\nWe operate a wholly-owned captive reinsurance subsidiary and participate in a reinsurance program for extended warranties. Our reinsurance program for extended warranties may not be successful or may incur larger losses than anticipated, which could harm our business and reputation.\nWe operate a wholly owned captive reinsurance subsidiary in connection with certain extended warranty contracts that we offer to our customers for sale by a third party servicer. Our captive reinsurance subsidiary then contracts with the third party servicer to reinsure the claims made under the extended warranties in exchange for which the third party servicer pays the premiums collected on the policies to the reinsurance subsidiary. The purpose of our reinsurance subsidiary is to absorb negative loss developments. Specifically, with product warranty programs, future developments regarding the products comprising the program and their attendant loss development remains uncertain. If future losses materially deviate from our current estimates, they may exceed the amounts collected for the payment of claims, which could render the reinsurance subsidiary unable to pay claims, which could result in our no longer being able to offer these products, subject us to third party claims and harm our reputation and ability to sell our other finance and insurance products, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary becomes subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we may be liable for its outstanding obligations.\nWe have structured our wholly-owned captive reinsurance subsidiary to be bankruptcy remote with the intention that assets of CarLotz would not be available to satisfy creditors. We can provide no guarantees that, in the actual event of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the structure of our reinsurance subsidiary will operate as intended. In addition, existing or future laws and regulations may be interpreted differently and may limit the extent of bankruptcy protections provided to us by our subsidiary.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Data Privacy\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, technology and confidential information, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and certain third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively grant all necessary rights to any inventions that may have been developed by the employees and consultants. In addition, these agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Changes in the law or adverse court rulings may also negatively affect our ability to prevent others from using our technology.\nWe currently hold rights to the \u201cCarLotz.com\u201d Internet domain name and various other related domain names. The regulation of domain names in the U.S. is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that use the name CarLotz or are otherwise important for our business.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data relating to our customers and corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers, and our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data could damage our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data provided by our sourcing partners and customers. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of such information. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain the security of personal and other data that is provided to us by our sourcing partners, customers and vendors could harm our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosing, use and protection of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations and that may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. Federal and various state governmental bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations limiting, or laws and regulations regarding, the collection, distribution, use, disclosure, storage and security of certain categories of information. Some of these requirements include obligations of companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving particular personal information, which could result from exploitation of a vulnerability in our systems or services or by our service providers or partners. For example, the State of California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy ACT (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA expands the scope of what is considered \u201cpersonal information\u201d and creates new data access and opt-out rights for consumers, which may create new requirements for us and other companies that operate in California. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), recently passed in California. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also created a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and become enforceable on July 1, 2023. We are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding telemarketing and other telephonic communications and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails, as well as regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls, texts or SMS messages.\nWe generally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties and may agree to additional contractual requirements addressing these matters from time to time. We strive to comply with applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent possible. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices or that new regulations could be enacted. Our compliance with these various requirements increases our operating costs, and additional laws, regulations, standards or protocols (or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations, standards or protocols) in these areas may further increase our operating costs and adversely affect our ability to effectively market our products and services. In view of new or modified legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any changes in their interpretation, we may find it necessary or desirable to change certain business activities and practices or to expend significant resources to modify our products and services and otherwise adapt to these changes. We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to our sourcing partners or customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other sourcing partner or customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our sourcing partners, customers and vendors to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if vendors, developers or other third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our sourcing partner, customer or vendors\u2019 information at risk and could in turn harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may from time to time face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim over some or all of our technology or services. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering some features, purchase licenses or modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes, or may result in significant settlement costs.\nEven if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. The stock market recently has experienced extreme volatility. This volatility often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. You may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at an attractive price due to a number of factors such as those listed in \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business\u201d and the following:\n\u00b7 results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 declines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u00b7 strategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 any significant change in our management;\n\u00b7 changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets;\n\u00b7 changes in business or regulatory conditions, including new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u00b7 future sales of common stock or other securities;\n\u00b7 investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u00b7 the public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7 litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u00b7 the development and sustainability of an active trading market for the common stock;\n\u00b7 actions by institutional or activist stockholders;\n\u00b7 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles; and\n\u00b7 other events or factors, including those resulting from concerted efforts by retail investors, pandemics, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events.\nThese broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of the common stock is low.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we are involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nBecause there are no current plans to pay cash dividends on the common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock at a price greater than what you paid for it.\nWe intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and there are no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in the common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nStockholders may experience dilution in the future.\nThe percentage of shares of common stock owned by current stockholders may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers and employees, exercise of the warrants or meeting the conditions under earnout shares issued in the Merger. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they change their recommendations regarding the common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the common stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for the common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our businesses. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for the common stock could be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our securities or publish unfavorable research about our businesses, or if our operating results do not meet analyst expectations, the trading price of the common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for the common stock could decrease, which might cause the common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for the common stock to decline.\nThe sale of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of March 10, 2021, we had a total of 113,670,060 shares of common stock outstanding. All shares held by former Acamar Partners public stockholders and all of the shares issued in the Merger to Former CarLotz stockholders are freely tradable without registration under the Securities Act, and without restriction by persons other than our \u201caffiliates\u201d (as defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, \u201cRule 144\u201d), including our directors, executive officers and other affiliates.\nIn connection with the Merger, certain Former CarLotz stockholders, agreed with us, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of their shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock during the period from the Closing Date continuing through the earliest of: (i) the date that is 180 days from the Closing Date; (ii) the last consecutive trading day when the last reported sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Closing Date (the \u201cAcceleration Date\u201d); or (iii) such date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property (the \u201cReorganization\u201d, and such date the \u201cReorganization Date\u201d). Similarly, Acamar Partners Sponsor I LLC (the \u2018Sponsor\u201d) has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of its shares of Acamar Partners Class B common stock (or any shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of such shares).\na) with respect to 50% of the shares, from the Closing Date until the earliest of (A) one year after the Closing Date, (B) the Acceleration Date and (C) the Reorganization Date, provided such Reorganization results in our common stockholders receiving at least $10.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like);\nb) with respect to 25% of the shares, the date on which the closing price of the common stock has exceeded $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) over any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after the Closing Date; and\nc) with respect to 25% of the shares, the date on which the closing trading price of the common stock has exceeded $15.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) over any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after the Closing Date;\nd) provided that, if any condition set forth in clause (b) or (c) above is not met before the first business day following 60 months from the Closing Date, the applicable portion of the shares will be forfeited.\nPursuant to a Registration Rights and Lock-up Agreement, certain stockholders will have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of common stock under the Securities Act. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares, these stockholders could cause the prevailing market price of the common stock to decline.\nAs restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights, the trading price of shares of the common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of common stock or other securities.\nIn addition, the shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to any applicable vesting requirements, lockup agreements and other restrictions imposed by law. A total number of shares representing 8% of the fully diluted shares of common stock immediately following consummation of the Merger (excluding the Earnout Shares and Earnout Acquiror RSUs) have been reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. The number of shares available for issuance under the plans will be automatically increased on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the 2022 fiscal year, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 2% of the outstanding shares of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (ii) such number of shares determined by our board of directors. The compensation committee of our board of directors may determine the exact number of shares to be reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans at its discretion. We expect to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock issued pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Any such Form S-8 registration statements will automatically become effective upon filing. Accordingly, shares registered under such registration statements will be available for sale in the open market. The initial registration statement on Form S-8 is expected to cover 8% of the fully diluted shares of common stock immediately following consummation of the Merger (excluding the Earnout Shares and Earnout Acquiror RSUs).\nIn the future, we may also issue securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding shares of common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to stockholders.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. We may continue to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We cannot predict whether investors will find securities issued by us less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find those securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation charter and bylaws and Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our management and limit the market price of the common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. These provisions include, among others, the following:\n\u00b7 authorization of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the common stock;\n\u00b7 limited liability for, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u00b7 our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u00b7 our directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of 66&frac23;% of the then-outstanding voting power of our voting stock;\n\u00b7 our board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, alter, amend or repeal our bylaws without a stockholder vote in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware, and any adoption, alteration, amendment or repeal of our bylaws by stockholders will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66&frac23;% of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote;\n\u00b7 no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7 vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum, and not by stockholders;\n\u00b7 a prohibition on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u00b7 advance notice procedures will apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting;\n\u00b7 any action to be taken by stockholders is required to be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u00b7 special meetings of stockholders can be called only by a majority of our board of directors, the chair of our board of directors or our Chief Executive Officer; and\n\u00b7 certain litigation against us can only be brought in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware) or, with respect to complaints asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, the federal district courts.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the DGCL, pursuant to which a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or longer or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation requires that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative actions brought on behalf of the Company, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, another state court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel, except for any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) that is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction or (D) any action arising under the federal securities laws, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall have concurrent jurisdiction. In addition, the provisions described above will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act claims. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our certificate of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that stockholder finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that certain transactions are not \u201ccorporate opportunities\u201d and that the parties to the Stockholders Agreement, or any of their principals, members, directors, partners, stockholders, officers, employees, or other representatives or affiliates (other than the Company and any entity that is controlled by the Company) are not subject to the doctrine of corporate opportunity.\nTwo of our directors, Mr. Steven G. Carrel and Mr. David R. Mitchell, are affiliates of TRP Capital Partners, LP (\u201cTRP\u201d) and one of our directors, Mr. Luis Ignacio Solorzano Aizpuru, is an affiliate of the Sponsor. Our certificate of incorporation provides that, to the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d will not apply to each of the stockholders party to the Stockholders Agreement, or any of their principals, members, directors, partners, stockholders, officers, employees, or other representatives or affiliates (other than the Company and any entity that is controlled by the Company) (\u201cIdentified Persons\u201d). The doctrine of corporate opportunity generally provides that a corporate fiduciary may not develop an opportunity using corporate resources, acquire an interest adverse to that of the corporation or acquire property that is reasonably incident to the present or prospective business of the corporation or in which the corporation has a present or expectancy interest, unless that opportunity is first presented to the corporation and the corporation chooses not to pursue that opportunity. The doctrine of corporate opportunity is intended to preclude officers, directors or other fiduciaries from personally benefiting from opportunities that belong to the corporation.\nTherefore, except as provided above, these Identified Persons (including Messrs. Carrel, Mitchell and Solorzano) have no duty to communicate or present corporate opportunities to us, have the right to either hold any corporate opportunity for their (and their affiliates\u2019) own account and benefit or to recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such corporate opportunity to persons other than us, and are not be prohibited from operating or investing in competing businesses. We therefore may find ourselves in competition with one or more of these Identified Persons, and we may not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose a corporate opportunity or suffer competitive harm, which could negatively affect our business or prospects.\nWe may redeem unexpired warrants held by former Acamar Partners stockholders prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous for those stockholders, thereby making such warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time prior to their expiration, at a price of\u2009 $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to: (1) exercise your warrants and pay the related exercise price at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so; (2) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants; or (3) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us for cash so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees.\nIn addition, we may redeem your warrants (including Private Placement Warrants) for a number of shares of common stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of the common stock. Any such redemption may have similar consequences to a cash redemption described above. In addition, such redemption may occur at a time when the warrants are \u201cout-of-the-money,\u201d in which case you would lose any potential embedded value from a subsequent increase in the value of the common stock had your warrants remained outstanding. See \u201cDescription of Securities\u2009-\u2009Description of Warrants\u2009-\u2009Redemption of Warrants for Cash\u201d and \u201c- Redemption of Warrants for shares of common stock.\u201d", "PERMNO": 18546, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "ACAM"}
