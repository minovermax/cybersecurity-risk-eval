{"cik": "1575189", "company": "Match Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\nThis annual report on Form 10-K contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of words such as \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cplans\u201d and \u201cbelieves,\u201d among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: Match Group\u2019s future financial performance, Match Group\u2019s business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which Match Group\u2019s businesses operate and other similar matters. These forward-looking statements are based on Match Group management\u2019s current expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this annual report, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.\nActual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others: the risk factors set forth below. Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect Match Group\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time. In light of these risks and uncertainties, these forward-looking statements discussed in this annual report may not prove to be accurate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which only reflect the views of Match Group management as of the date of this annual report. Match Group does not undertake to update these forward-looking statements.\nRisks relating to our business\nThe dating industry is competitive, with low switching costs and a consistent stream of new products and entrants, and innovation by our competitors may disrupt our business.\nThe dating industry is competitive, with a consistent stream of new products and entrants. Some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographical regions, user demographics or other key areas that we currently serve or may serve in the future. These advantages could enable these competitors to offer products that are more appealing to users and potential users than our products or to respond more quickly and/or cost-effectively than us to new or changing opportunities.\nIn addition, within the dating industry generally, costs for consumers to switch between products are low, and consumers have a propensity to try new approaches to connecting with people and to use multiple dating products at the same time. As a result, new products, entrants and business models are likely to continue to emerge. It is possible that a new product could gain rapid scale at the expense of existing brands through harnessing a new technology or a new or existing distribution channel, creating a new or different approach to connecting people or some other means.\nPotential competitors include larger companies that could devote greater resources to the promotion or marketing of their products and services, take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their products and services more quickly than we do. Potential competitors also include established social media companies that may develop products, features, or services that may compete with ours. For example, Facebook has introduced a dating feature on its platform, which it has rolled out in North America and other markets and has stated it plans to roll out globally. These social media competitors could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets, and ready access to existing large pools of potential users and personal information regarding those users, to gain competitive advantages over us, including by offering different product features or services that users may prefer or offering their products and services to users at no charge, which may enable them to acquire and engage users at the expense of our user growth or engagement.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively against our current or future competitors and products that may emerge, the size and level of engagement of our user base may decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe limited operating history of our newer dating brands and products makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.\nWe seek to tailor each of our dating brands and products to meet the preferences of specific communities of users. Building a given brand or product is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources and expenditures. Although certain of our newer brands and products\nhave experienced significant growth over relatively short periods of time, the historical growth rates of these brands and products may not be an indication of future growth rates for such products or our newer brands and products generally. We have encountered, and may continue to encounter, risks and difficulties as we build our newer brands and products. The failure to successfully address these risks and difficulties could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEach of our dating products monetizes users at different rates. If a meaningful migration of our user base from our higher monetizing dating products to our lower monetizing dating products were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur portfolio companies own, operate, and manage a diverse variety of dating products. Each dating product has its own mix of free and paid features designed to optimize the user experience and revenue generation from that product\u2019s community of users. In general, the mix of features for the various dating products within our more established brands leads to higher monetization rates per user than the mix of features for the various dating products within our newer brands. Over time, users of our newer brands with lower monetization rates per user comprise an increasingly larger percentage of our user base. If this trend leads to a significant portion of users of our brands with higher monetization rates migrating to our less profitable brands, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-Management overview-Trends affecting our business.\u201d\nOur growth and profitability rely, in part, on our ability to attract and retain users through cost-effective marketing efforts. Any failure in these efforts could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAttracting and retaining users for certain of our dating products involve considerable expenditures for online and offline marketing. Historically, we have had to increase our marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and retain users and sustain our growth.\nEvolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of profitable marketing opportunities. For example, as traditional television viewership declines and as consumers spend more time on mobile devices rather than desktop computers, the reach of many of our traditional advertising channels is contracting. Similarly, as consumers communicate less via email and more via text messaging and other virtual means, the reach of email campaigns designed to attract new and repeat users (and retain current users) for our dating products is adversely impacted. To continue to reach potential users and grow our businesses, we must identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer advertising channels, such as mobile and online video platforms, as well as targeted campaigns in which we communicate directly with potential, former and current users via new virtual means. Generally, the opportunities in and sophistication of newer advertising channels are relatively undeveloped and unproven, making it difficult to assess returns on investment associated with such advertising channels, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to appropriately manage and fine-tune our marketing efforts in response to these and other trends in the advertising industry. Any failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCommunicating with our users via email is critical to our success, and any erosion in our ability to communicate in this fashion that is not sufficiently replaced by other means could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, one of our primary means of communicating with our users and keeping them engaged with our products has been via email communication. Our ability to communicate via email enables us to keep our users updated on activity with respect to their profile, present or suggest new or interesting users from the community, invite users to offline events and present discount and promotional offers, among other things. As consumer habits evolve in the era of web-enabled mobile devices and messaging/social networking apps, usage of email, particularly among our younger users, has declined. In addition, deliverability and other restrictions imposed by third party email providers and/or applicable law could limit or prevent our ability to send emails to our users. A continued and significant erosion in our ability to communicate successfully with our users via email could have an adverse impact on user experience, levels of user engagement and the rate at which non-paying users become subscribers.\nWhile we continually work to find new means of communicating and connecting with our users (for example, through push notifications), there is no assurance that such alternative means of communication will be\nas effective as email has been. Any failure to develop or take advantage of new means of communication or limitations on those means of communications imposed by laws, device manufacturers or other sources could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe operate in various international markets, primarily in various jurisdictions within the European Union and Asia. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, 53% and 50% of our total revenues, respectively, were international revenues. We translate international revenues into U.S. dollar-denominated operating results and during periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our international revenues will be reduced when translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the translation of our international revenues into U.S. dollar-denominated operating results affects the period-over-period comparability of such results and can result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses.\nWe have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to transactions carried out in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, and investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. Our exposure is primarily related to the Euro, and to a lesser extent, the British Pound (\u201cGBP\u201d). The average GBP and Euro exchange rates strengthened against the U.S. Dollar by 4% and 5%, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018. See \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.\u201d\nThe departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d has caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the GBP and the full impact of Brexit remains uncertain. To the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to either the Euro, the GBP or both, the translation of our international revenues into U.S. dollars will reduce our U.S. dollar denominated operating results and will affect their period-over-period comparability.\nHistorically, we have not hedged any foreign currency exposures. The continued growth and expansion of our international operations into new countries increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies, could adversely affect our future results of operations.\nDistribution and marketing of, and access to, our dating products depends, in significant part, on a variety of third-party publishers, platforms and mobile app stores. If these third parties limit, prohibit or otherwise interfere with or change the terms of the distribution, use or marketing of our dating products in any material way, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe market and distribute our dating products (including related mobile applications) through a variety of third-party publishers and distribution channels, including Facebook, which has rolled out its own dating product. Our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant third party. Certain publishers and channels have, from time to time, limited or prohibited advertisements for dating products for a variety of reasons, including poor behavior by other industry participants. There is no assurance that we will not be limited or prohibited from using certain current or prospective marketing channels in the future. If this were to happen in the case of a significant marketing channel and/or for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our mobile applications are almost exclusively accessed through the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Both Apple and Google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our applications, including the amount of, and requirement to pay, certain fees associated with purchases facilitated by Apple and Google through our applications, and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute our applications through their stores, the features we provide, the manner in which we market our in-app products, and our ability to access information about our users and subscribers that they collect. Apple or Google could also make changes to their operating systems or payment services that could negatively impact our business. There is no assurance that Apple or Google will not limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our products, the features we provide, the manner in which we market our in-app products within our applications or through other applications and services, and our ability to access information about our users and subscribers that they collect. To the extent either or both of them do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLastly, in the case of Tinder, Hinge, and certain of our other products, many users historically registered for (and logged into) the application exclusively through their Facebook profiles. While we have launched an alternate authentication method that allows users to register for (and log into) Tinder, Hinge, and our other products using their mobile phone number, no assurances can be provided that users will no longer register for (and log into) these products through their Facebook profiles. Facebook has broad discretion to change its terms and conditions applicable to the data collected by its platform and its use thereof and to interpret its terms and conditions in ways that could limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to use Facebook as an authentication method or to allow Facebook to use such data to gain a competitive advantage. If Facebook did so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our products will depend, in part, on our ability to access, collect, and use personal data about our users and subscribers.\nWe depend on mobile app stores, in particular, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, to market, distribute and monetize our mobile applications. Our users and subscribers engage with these platforms directly and may be subject to requirements regarding the use of their payment systems for various transactions. As a result, these platforms may receive personal data about our users and subscribers that we would otherwise receive if we transacted with our users and subscribers directly. These platforms have restricted our access to personal data about our users and subscribers obtained through their platforms. If these platforms continue to limit or increasingly limit, eliminate, or otherwise interfere with our ability to access, collect, and use personal data about our users and subscribers that they have collected, the ability of our products to identify and communicate with a meaningful portion of our users and subscriber bases may be adversely impacted. If so, our customer relationship management efforts, our ability to identify, target, and reach new segments of our user and subscriber bases and the population generally, the efficiency of our paid marketing efforts, the rates we are able to charge advertisers seeking to reach users and subscribers on our various properties, and our ability to identify and exclude users and subscribers whose access would violate applicable terms and conditions, including registered sex offenders, may be negatively impacted. There is no assurance that the mobile app stores upon which we rely will not limit or increasingly limit, eliminate, or otherwise interfere with our ability to access, collect, and use personal data about our users and subscribers that they have collected. To the extent that they do so, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs the distribution of our dating products through app stores increases, in order to maintain our profit margins, we may need to offset increasing app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures, increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally, or our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe increasingly rely on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our mobile applications and related in-app products. While our mobile applications are generally free to download from these stores, we offer our users the opportunity to purchase subscriptions and certain \u00e0 la carte features through these applications. We determine the prices at which these subscriptions and features are sold; however, purchases of these subscriptions and features are required to be processed through the in-app payment systems provided by Apple and, to a lesser degree, Google. Due to these requirements, we pay Apple and Google, as applicable, a meaningful share (generally 30%) of the revenue we receive from these transactions. While we are constantly innovating on and creating our own payment systems and methods, given the increase of the distribution of our dating products through app stores and the strict requirements to use the in-app payments systems tied into Apple\u2019s, and to a lesser degree, Google\u2019s distribution services, we may need to offset these increased app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue, increasing user volume or monetization per user, or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally, or our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, to the extent Google changes its terms and conditions or practices to require us to process purchases of subscriptions and features through their in-app payment system, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our key personnel.\nOur future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals across the globe, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success. Competition for well-qualified employees across Match Group and its various\nbusinesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees. While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future. Effective succession planning is also important to our future success. If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses, our ability to execute short and long term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and on our ability to enhance, expand and adapt these systems and infrastructures in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nIn order for us to succeed, our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis. We have in the past, and we may from time to time in the future, experience system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable and prevent our products from functioning properly for our users; any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons. Further, our systems and infrastructures are vulnerable to damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of God and similar events. While we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, not all of our systems and infrastructures are fully redundant, disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities and our property and business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that we may suffer. Any interruptions or outages, regardless of the cause, could negatively impact our users\u2019 experiences with our products, tarnish our brands\u2019 reputations and decrease demand for our products, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems to improve the experience of our users, accommodate substantial increases in the volume of traffic to our various products, ensure acceptable load times for our products and keep up with changes in technology and user preferences. Any failure to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely affect our users\u2019 experience with our various products and thereby negatively impact the demand for our products, and could increase our costs, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our systems and infrastructures from cyberattacks and may be adversely affected by cyberattacks experienced by third parties.\nWe are regularly under attack by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information and account login credentials. While we have invested (and continue to invest) in the protection of our systems and infrastructures, in related personnel and training and in employing a strategy of data minimization, where appropriate, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breaches in our systems or other such events from occurring. Some of our systems have experienced past security incidents, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Any cyber or similar attack we are unable to protect ourselves against could damage our systems and infrastructures, prevent us from providing our products, erode our reputation and brands, result in the disclosure of confidential or sensitive information of our users and/or be costly to remedy, as well as subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities and/or litigation that could result in liability to third parties.\nThe impact of cyber security events experienced by third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day-to-day operations) could have a similar effect on us. Moreover, even cyber or similar attacks that do not directly affect us or third parties with whom we do business may result in widespread access to user account login credentials that such users have used across multiple internet sites, including our sites, or a loss of consumer confidence generally, which could make users less likely to use or continue to use online products generally, including our products. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on the integrity of third-party systems and infrastructures.\nWe rely on third parties, primarily data center service providers and cloud-based, hosted web service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, as well as third party computer systems, broadband and other communications systems and service providers, in connection with the provision of our products generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users. We have no control over any of these third parties or their operations.\nProblems experienced by third-party data center service providers and cloud-based, hosted web service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, upon whom we rely, the telecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract or with the systems through which telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers could also adversely affect us. Any changes in service levels at our data centers or hosted web service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, or any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide our products or process transactions with our users, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the security of personal and confidential or sensitive user information that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons, it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event and our reputation could be harmed.\nWe receive, process, store, and transmit a significant amount of personal user and other confidential or sensitive information, including credit card information and member-to-member communications, and enable our users to share their personal information with each other. In some cases, we engage third party vendors to store this information. We continuously develop and maintain systems to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of this information, but cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts. When such events occur, we may not be able to remedy them, we may be required by law to notify regulators and individuals whose personal information was used or disclosed without authorization, and we may have to expend significant capital and other resources to mitigate the impact of such events, including developing and implementing protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring. When breaches of security (or the security of our vendors and partners) occur, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures, the security measures of our partners and our reputation may be harmed, we may lose current and potential users and the recognition of our various brands and their competitive positions may be diminished, any or all of which might adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters that are important to or may otherwise impact our business, including, among others, broadband internet access, online commerce, advertising, user privacy, data protection, intermediary liability, protection of minors, consumer protection, sex-trafficking, taxation and securities law compliance. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal, state, and municipal and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from state to state and country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. These laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products, require that we change or cease certain business practices, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nSpecifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities. While we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us. Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProposed or new legislation and regulations could also adversely affect our business. For example, the European Commission and several countries have recently adopted, or intend to adopt, proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed, including proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, France enacted a Digital Services Tax in 2019 retroactive to January 1, 2019, which is applicable to our business. The United Kingdom has also proposed a similar tax applicable to digital services, which includes business activities on social media platforms, and would likely apply to our business. One or more of these or similar proposals could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the new interpretation of existing laws and regulations, in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide our services could require us to change certain aspects of our business and operations to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenues, increase costs and subject us to additional liabilities. For example, in February 2019, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport of the United Kingdom, indicated in public comments that his office intends to inquire as to the measures utilized by online dating platforms, including Tinder, to prevent access by underage users. In addition, in April 2019, the United Kingdom published proposed legislation, which would establish a new regulatory body to establish duties of care for internet companies and to assess compliance with these duties of care. Under the proposed law, failure to comply could result in fines, blocking of services and personal liability for senior management. There have also been calls for legislation to limit or remove the protections afforded technology platforms under the Communications Decency Act in the United States and under the e-Commerce Directive in the European Union. To the extent such new or more stringent measures are required to be implemented, or existing protections are limited or removed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet or our services, including laws or regulations that undermine open and neutrally administered internet access, could decrease user demand for our service offerings and increase our cost of doing business. For example, in December 2017, the Federal Communications Commission adopted an order reversing net neutrality protections in the United States, including the repeal of specific rules against blocking, throttling or \u201cpaid prioritization\u201d of content or services by internet service providers. To the extent internet service providers engage in such blocking, throttling, \u201cpaid prioritization\u201d of content or similar actions as a result of this order and the adoption of similar laws or regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe varying and rapidly-evolving regulatory framework on privacy and data protection across jurisdictions could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nThere are numerous laws in the countries in which we operate regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which are constantly changing, and in some cases, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations, as new laws of this nature are proposed and adopted. For example, in 2016, the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Act (\u201cGDPR\u201d), a comprehensive European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) privacy and data protection reform that became effective in May 2018. The act applies to companies established in the European Union or otherwise providing services or monitoring the behavior of people located in the European Union and provides for significant penalties in case of non-compliance as well as a private right of action for individual claimants. GDPR will continue to be interpreted by EU data protection regulators, which may require that we make changes to our business practices, and could generate additional risks and liabilities. The European Union is also considering an update to the EU\u2019s Privacy and Electronic Communications (so-called \u201ce-Privacy\u201d) Directive, notably to amend rules on the use of cookies. In addition, Brexit could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the United Kingdom and our handling of personal data of users located in the United Kingdom. At the same time, many countries in which we do business have already adopted or are also currently considering adopting privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Multiple legislative proposals\nconcerning privacy and the protection of user information are being considered by the U.S. Congress. Various U.S. state legislatures, including those in New York, Washington, Virginia, and Illinois, intend to consider privacy legislation in 2020. Other U.S. state legislatures have already passed and enacted privacy legislation, most prominent of which is the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which was signed into law in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020. A ballot initiative to address privacy concerns has also been filed with the Office of the California Attorney General and, provided it meets appropriate legal requirements, is expected to be presented to California voters on the November 2020 ballot. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission has increased its focus on privacy and data security practices at digital companies, as evidenced by its levying, in July 2019, of a first-of-its kind, $5 billion fine against Facebook for privacy violations.\nWhile we believe that we comply with industry standards and applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection in all material respects, there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws or codes of conduct, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance. Additionally, to the extent multiple state-level laws are introduced with inconsistent or conflicting standards and there is no federal law to preempt such laws, compliance with such laws could be difficult to achieve and we could be subject to fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us (or the third parties with whom we have contracted to process such information) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access, or the use or transmission of, personal user information, could result in a variety of claims against us, including governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties, and adverse publicity. When such events occur, our reputation may be harmed, we may lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands might be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLastly, compliance with the numerous laws in the countries in which we operate regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data could be costly, as well as result in delays in the development of new products and features as resources are allocated to these compliance projects, particularly as these laws become more comprehensive in scope, more commonplace and continue to evolve. In addition, the varying and rapidly-evolving regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions may result in decisions to introduce products in certain jurisdictions but not others or to cease providing certain services or features to users located in certain jurisdictions. If these costs or other impacts are significant, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments, including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties experience or additional regulation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe accept payment from our users primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers. The ability to access credit card information on a real-time basis without having to proactively reach out to the consumer each time we process an auto-renewal payment or a payment for the purchase of a premium feature on any of our dating products is critical to our success and a seamless experience for our users.\nWhen we or a third party experiences a data security breach involving credit card information, affected cardholders will often cancel their credit cards. In the case of a breach experienced by a third party, the more sizable the third party\u2019s customer base and the greater the number of credit card accounts impacted, the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by such a breach. To the extent our users are ever affected by such a breach experienced by us or a third party, affected users would need to be contacted to obtain new credit card information and process any pending transactions. It is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected users, and even if we could, some users\u2019 new credit card information may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach, they may lose confidence in the ability of service providers to protect their personal information generally, which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant cost or user effort.\nAdditionally, if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face litigation, fines, governmental enforcement action, civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, significantly higher credit card-related costs and substantial remediation costs, or refusal by credit card processors to continue to process payments on our behalf, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinally, the passage or adoption of any legislation or regulation affecting the ability of service providers to periodically charge consumers for recurring subscription payments may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the European Union\u2019s Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which became effective in 2018, could impact our ability to process auto-renewal payments or offer promotional or differentiated pricing for users in the EU. Similar legislation or regulation, or changes to existing legislation or regulation governing subscription payments, are being considered in many U.S. states.\nInappropriate actions by certain of our users could be attributed to us and damage our brands\u2019 reputations, which in turn could adversely affect our business.\nIt is possible that a user of our products could be physically, financially, emotionally or otherwise harmed by an individual that such user met through the use of one of our products. If one or more of our users suffers or alleges to have suffered any such harm, we could experience negative publicity or legal action that could damage our reputation and our brands. Similar events affecting users of our competitors\u2019 products could result in negative publicity for the dating industry generally, which could in turn negatively affect our business.\nIn addition, the reputations of our brands may be adversely affected by the actions of our users that are deemed to be hostile, offensive, defamatory, inappropriate, untrue or unlawful. While we have systems and processes in place that aim to monitor and review the appropriateness of the content accessible through our products, which include, in particular, reporting tools through which users can inform us of such behavior on the platform, and have adopted policies regarding illegal, offensive or inappropriate use of our products, our users could nonetheless engage in activities that violate our policies. These safeguards may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation and brands, especially if such hostile, offensive or inappropriate use is well-publicized.\nConcerns about harms and the use of dating products and social networking platforms for illegal conduct, such as romance scams, promotion of false or inaccurate information, financial fraud, and sex-trafficking, have produced and could continue to produce future legislation or other governmental action. For example, in April 2018, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act became effective in the United States and allows victims of sex trafficking crimes, as well as other state and local authorities, to seek redress from platforms in certain circumstances in connection with sex trafficking of individuals online. The European Union and the United Kingdom have also launched consultations, and the United Kingdom has released its Online Harms White Paper, which proposed legislation that would expose platforms to similar or more expansive liability. There have also been calls for legislation to limit or remove the protections afforded technology platforms under the Communications Decency Act in the United States and under the e-Commerce Directive in the European Union. If these proposed laws are passed, or if future legislation or governmental action is proposed or taken to address concerns regarding such harms, changes could be required to our products that could restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business generally or cause users to abandon our products.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition. We also rely upon patented and patent-pending proprietary technologies and trade secrets relating to matching process systems and related features and products.\nWe also rely on a combination of laws, and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others, to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights. For example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate. Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which our products are made available, and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.\nWe also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then-current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future. No assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies. In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.\nDespite these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization, or laws and interpretations of laws regarding the enforceability of existing intellectual property rights may change over time in a manner that provides less protection. The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limit our ability to market our brands using our various domain names, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets and patents or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. For example, in March 2018, we filed a lawsuit against Bumble Trading Inc., which operates and markets the online dating application Bumble in the United States, for patent and trademark infringement, as well as trade secret misappropriation. Bumble\u2019s counterclaims request that our trademark registration for our SWIPE trademark be cancelled and that a number of our pending applications for trademark registration be denied. This case is currently pending in Federal Court in the Western District of Texas. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in various international markets, including certain markets in which we have limited experience. As a result, we face additional risks in connection with certain of our international operations.\nOur brands are available in over 40 different languages all over the world. Our international revenue represented 53% and 50% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOperating internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, exposes us to a number of additional risks, including:\n\u2022operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022differing levels of social and technological acceptance of our dating products or lack of acceptance of them generally;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds among countries and back to the United States and costs associated with repatriating funds to the United States;\n\u2022differing and potentially adverse tax laws;\n\u2022multiple, conflicting and changing laws, rules and regulations, and difficulties understanding and ensuring compliance with those laws by both our employees and our business partners, over whom we exert no control;\n\u2022compliance challenges due to different laws and regulatory environments, particularly in the case of privacy, data security, and intermediary liability;\n\u2022competitive environments that favor local businesses;\n\u2022limitations on the level of intellectual property protection; and\n\u2022trade sanctions, political unrest, terrorism, war and epidemics or the threat of any of these events.\nThe occurrence of any or all of the events described above could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions.\nWe have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek potential acquisition candidates. We may experience operational and financial risks in connection with historical and future acquisitions if we are unable to:\n\u2022properly value prospective acquisitions, especially those with limited operating histories;\n\u2022accurately review acquisition candidates\u2019 business practices against applicable laws and regulations and, where applicable, implement proper remediation controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u2022successfully integrate the operations, as well as the accounting, financial controls, management information, technology, human resources and other administrative systems, of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems;\n\u2022successfully identify and realize potential synergies among acquired and existing businesses;\n\u2022fully identify potential risks and liabilities associated with acquired businesses;\n\u2022retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses; and\n\u2022successfully manage acquisition-related strain on our management, operations and financial resources and those of the various brands in our portfolio.\nFurthermore, we may not be successful in addressing other challenges encountered in connection with our acquisitions. The anticipated benefits of one or more of our acquisitions may not be realized or the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges. In addition, such acquisitions can result in material diversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing businesses. The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to litigation and adverse outcomes in such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are, and from time to time may become, subject to litigation and various legal proceedings, including litigation and proceedings related to intellectual property matters, privacy and consumer protection laws, as well as stockholder derivative suits, class action lawsuits and other matters, that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations. The defense of these actions is time consuming and expensive. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as and when required or appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on information available to management at the time of such assessment or estimation and involve a significant amount of judgment. As a result, actual outcomes or losses could differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any of these litigations or legal proceedings could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to our ongoing relationship with IAC prior to the Separation\nIAC controls our company and has the ability to control the direction of our business.\nAs of January 31, 2020, IAC owned 18,160,609 shares of our common stock and 209,919,402 shares of Class B common stock representing 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock. IAC\u2019s ownership of our outstanding common stock and Class B common stock represents approximately 80.7% of our outstanding shares of capital stock and approximately 97.5% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As long as IAC owns shares of our capital stock representing a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, it will be able to control any corporate action that requires a stockholder vote, regardless of the vote\nof any other stockholder. As a result, prior to the Separation, IAC has the ability to control significant corporate activities, including:\n\u2022the election of our board of directors and, through our board of directors, decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers;\n\u2022acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets, mergers or other business combinations;\n\u2022issuances of shares of our common stock, Class B common stock, Class C common stock and our capital structure;\n\u2022corporate opportunities that may be suitable for us and IAC, subject to the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation, as described below;\n\u2022our financing activities, including the issuance of additional debt and equity securities, or the incurrence of other indebtedness generally;\n\u2022the payment of dividends; and\n\u2022the number of shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans for our prospective and existing employees.\nThis voting control will limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that stockholders other than IAC do not view as beneficial. This voting control may also discourage transactions involving a change of control of our company, including transactions in which holders of our common stock might otherwise receive a premium for the holders\u2019 shares. Furthermore, IAC generally has the right at any time to sell or otherwise dispose of the shares of our capital stock that it owns, including the ability to transfer a controlling interest in us to a third party, without the approval of the holders of our common stock and without providing for the purchase of shares of common stock.\nEven if IAC owns shares of our capital stock representing less than a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, so long as IAC retains shares representing a significant percentage of our combined voting power, IAC will have the ability to substantially influence these significant corporate activities.\nIn addition, pursuant to an investor rights agreement between us and IAC, prior to the Separation and in the event the Separation is not consummated, IAC has the right to maintain its level of ownership in us to the extent we issue additional shares of our capital stock in the future and, pursuant to an employee matters agreement between us and IAC, IAC may receive payment for certain compensation expenses through the receipt of additional shares of our capital stock. For a more complete summary of our agreements with IAC, see \u201cNote 16-Related Party Transactions\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in \u201cItem 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nIn addition, because of our relationship with IAC, credit rating agencies have considered, and prior to the Separation and in the event the Separation is not consummated, could continue to consider, IAC\u2019s creditworthiness when determining a corporate credit rating for us or credit ratings for our debt. Accordingly, prior to the Separation and in the event the Separation is not consummated, the activities of, or developments at, IAC that are outside of our control could have a negative impact on such credit ratings. A lowering of our corporate credit ratings or the credit ratings assigned to our debt could harm our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms. Until such time as IAC no longer controls or has the ability to substantially influence us, we will continue to face the risks described in this \u201cRisk factors\u201d section relating to IAC\u2019s control of us and the potential conflicts of interest between IAC and us.\nPrior to the Separation, our certificate of incorporation could prevent us from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to us.\nOur certificate of incorporation has a \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d provision in which we renounce any interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to: (i) any of our directors or officers who are also officers, directors, employees or other affiliates of IAC or its affiliates (except that we and our subsidiaries shall not be deemed affiliates of IAC or its affiliates for the purposes of the provision) or (ii) IAC itself, and which relate to the business of IAC or may constitute a corporate opportunity for both IAC and us. Generally, neither IAC nor our officers or directors who are also officers or directors of IAC or its affiliates will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such person pursues or acquires any\ncorporate opportunity for the account of IAC or its affiliates, directs or transfers such corporate opportunity to IAC or its affiliates, or does not communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us. The corporate opportunity provision may exacerbate conflicts of interest between IAC and us because the provision effectively permits any of our directors or officers who also serves as an officer or director of IAC to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of to us.\nIAC\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of our stockholders. Prior to the Separation and in the event the Separation is not consummated, conflicts of interest between IAC and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and our public stockholders.\nVarious conflicts of interest between us and IAC could arise. As of the date of this report, five of our ten directors are current members of the board of directors or executive officers of IAC. Ownership interests of directors or officers of IAC in our stock and ownership interests of our directors and officers in the stock of IAC, or a person\u2019s service as either a director or officer of both companies, could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when those directors and officers are faced with decisions relating to our company. These decisions could include:\n\u2022corporate opportunities;\n\u2022the impact that operating decisions for our business may have on IAC\u2019s consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022the impact that operating or capital decisions (including the incurrence of indebtedness) for our business may have on IAC\u2019s current or future indebtedness or the covenants under that indebtedness;\n\u2022business combinations involving us;\n\u2022our dividend policy;\n\u2022management stock ownership; and\n\u2022the intercompany services and agreements between IAC and us.\nPotential conflicts of interest could also arise if we decide to enter into any new commercial arrangements with IAC in the future or in connection with IAC\u2019s desire to enter into new commercial arrangements with third parties.\nFurthermore, prior to the Separation and in the event the Separation is not consummated, disputes may arise between IAC and us relating to our past and ongoing relationships, and these potential conflicts of interest may make it more difficult for us to favorably resolve such disputes, including those related to:\n\u2022tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters;\n\u2022the nature, quality and pricing of services IAC agrees to provide to us;\n\u2022sales or other disposal by IAC of all or a portion of its ownership interest in us; and\n\u2022business combinations involving us.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts with IAC, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party. While we are controlled by IAC, we may not have the leverage to negotiate amendments to these agreements, if required, on terms as favorable to us as those we would negotiate with an unaffiliated third party.\nWe are currently a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in the NASDAQ rules, and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies.\nAs a result of IAC owning more than 50% of the combined voting power of our share capital, we are currently a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the Marketplace Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, or the Marketplace Rules. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we are exempt from the obligation to comply with certain Marketplace Rules related to corporate governance, including the following requirements:\n\u2022that a majority of our board of directors consists of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under the Marketplace Rules; and\n\u2022that we have a nominating/governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nAccordingly, prior to the Separation and for so long as we are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the Marketplace Rules.\nPrior to the Separation and in the event the Separation is not consummated, in order to preserve the ability of IAC to distribute its shares of our capital stock on a tax-free basis, and to maintain tax consolidation with IAC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be prevented from pursuing opportunities to raise capital, effectuate acquisitions or provide equity incentives to our employees, and our ability to manage our capital structure may also be adversely impacted, all of which could hurt our ability to grow.\nUnder current laws, IAC must retain beneficial ownership of at least 80% of our combined voting power and 80% of each class of our nonvoting capital stock (if any is outstanding) in order to effect a tax-free distribution of our shares held by IAC to its stockholders. IAC has advised us that it intends to use its majority voting interest to retain its ability to engage in such a transaction. In addition, IAC must maintain ownership of at least 80% of our outstanding capital stock in order to maintain tax consolidation with us for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As of the date of this report, IAC has advised us that it currently intends to take such actions, or cause Match Group to take such actions, as may be necessary in order to preserve tax consolidation. Each of these intentions may cause IAC to not support transactions we wish to pursue that involve issuing shares of our capital stock, including for capital raising purposes, as consideration for an acquisition or as equity incentives to our employees, and may also otherwise impact our overall capital management strategy. The inability to pursue any such transactions or any reduced flexibility in the management of our capital structure, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201c-IAC controls our company and will have the ability to control the direction of our business\u201d and \u201c-IAC\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of our stockholders.\u201d Conflicts of interest between IAC and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and our public stockholders.\nPrior to the Separation and in the event the Separation is not consummated, our agreements with IAC will require us to indemnify IAC for certain tax liabilities and may limit our ability to engage in desirable strategic or capital raising transactions, including following any distribution by IAC of our capital stock to its stockholders.\nUnder a tax sharing agreement between us and IAC, we generally are responsible and are required to indemnify IAC for: (i) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of IAC or one of its subsidiaries that includes us or any of our subsidiaries to the extent attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, as determined under the tax sharing agreement, and (ii) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined, unitary or separate tax returns of us or any of our subsidiaries. To the extent IAC failed to pay taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of IAC or one of its subsidiaries that includes us or any of our subsidiaries, the relevant taxing authority could seek to collect such taxes (including taxes for which IAC is responsible under the tax sharing agreement) from us or our subsidiaries.\nUnder the tax sharing agreement, we generally will be responsible for any taxes and related amounts imposed on IAC or us that arise from the failure of a future spin-off of IAC\u2019s interest in us to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Section 368(a)(1)(D) and/or Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, of the Code, to the extent that the failure to so qualify is attributable to: (i) a breach of the relevant representations and covenants made by us in the tax sharing agreement or any representation letter provided in support of any tax opinion or ruling obtained by IAC with respect to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of such spin-off, or (ii) an acquisition of our equity securities.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of any potential future spin-off by IAC of its interest in us, and in addition to our indemnity obligation described above, the tax sharing agreement will restrict us, for the two-year period following any such spin-off, except in specific circumstances, from: (i) entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of shares of our stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing our shares other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing to actively conduct our businesses or (v) taking or failing to take any other action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Section 368(a)(1)(D) and/or Section 355 of the Code. In addition, the tax\nsharing agreement provides that, without IAC\u2019s prior written consent, we may not take any action that could reasonably be expected to (i) cause IAC to cease to have \u201ccontrol\u201d of us within the meaning of Section 386(c) of the Code or (ii) result in the loss of IAC\u2019s tax consolidation with us for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThese indemnity obligations and other limitations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture sales or distributions of our shares by IAC could depress our common stock price.\nIAC has the right to sell or distribute to its stockholders all or a portion of the shares of our capital stock that it holds (18,160,609 shares of our common stock and 209,919,402 shares of our Class B common stock, representing all of our outstanding Class B common stock, as of January 31, 2020). Any sales by IAC in the public market or distributions to its stockholders of substantial amounts of our stock in the form of common stock or Class B common stock, or the filing by IAC of a registration statement relating to a substantial amount of our stock, could depress the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, prior to the Separation and in the event the Separation is not consummated, IAC has the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of its shares or to include its shares in other registration statements that we may file. In the event IAC exercises its registration rights and sells all or a portion of its shares of our capital stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nPrior to the Separation and in the event the Separation is not consummated, the services that IAC provides to us may not be sufficient to meet our needs, which may result in increased costs and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIAC currently provides (and, in the event the Separation is not consummated, is expected to continue to provide) us with corporate and shared services related to certain corporate functions, including tax and other services, for a fee provided in the services agreement described in \u201cItem 1 - Business-Relationship with IAC.\u201d IAC is not obligated to provide these services in a manner that differs from the nature of the service when we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC, and thus we may not be able to modify these services in a manner desirable to us as a stand-alone public company. Further, if we no longer receive these services from IAC, we may not be able to perform these services ourselves, or find appropriate third-party arrangements at a reasonable cost, and the cost may be higher than that charged by IAC.\nRisks relating to our indebtedness\nOur indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.6 billion and borrowing availability of $500 million under our revolving credit facility. In February 2020, we issued an additional $500 million of senior notes and increased the borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility to $750 million.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences, such as:\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures or other debt service requirements or for other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service debt;\n\u2022limiting our ability to compete with other companies who are not as highly leveraged, as we may be less capable of responding to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions, developing properties or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022restricting the way in which we conduct our business because of financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 existing and future indebtedness, including, in the case of certain indebtedness of subsidiaries, certain covenants that restrict the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us;\n\u2022exposing us to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under financial and operating covenants contained in our or our subsidiaries\u2019 debt instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results; increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in pricing of our products; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to react to changing market conditions in our industry and in our customers\u2019 industries.\nIn addition to our debt service obligations, our operations require substantial investments on a continuing basis. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non-capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets and properties, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our business, depends on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legal and other factors.\nSubject to the restrictions in our credit agreement (which includes our revolving credit facility and term loan) and the restrictions included in the indentures related to our 6.375% Senior Notes due 2024, 5.00% Senior Notes due 2027, 5.625% Senior Notes due 2029, and the 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030 (the \u201cMatch Group Senior Notes\u201d), we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness. Although the terms of our credit agreement and the indentures related to the Match Group Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the risks described above could increase.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our current and planned indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon, among other things:\n\u2022our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control; and\n\u2022our future ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility, the availability of which will depend on, among other things, our complying with the covenants in the then-existing agreements governing our indebtedness.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to draw under our revolving credit facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, sell equity, and/or negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt, in order to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. Our credit agreement and the indentures related to the Match Group Senior Notes may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to avail ourselves of some or all of these options.\nFurthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur credit agreement and the indentures related to the Match Group Senior Notes contain, and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022create liens on certain assets;\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022make certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make restricted payments;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022cause our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us.\nAny of these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict corporate activities. Any failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreement and/or the indentures related to the Match Group Senior Notes or any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours. Upon a default, unless waived, the lenders under our credit agreement could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, foreclose on our assets pledged to such lenders to secure our obligations under our credit agreement and force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. Holders of the Match Group Senior Notes also have the ability to force us into bankruptcy or liquidation in certain circumstances, subject to the terms of the related indentures. In addition, a default under our credit agreement or the indentures related to the Match Group Senior Notes may trigger a cross default under our other agreements and could trigger a cross default under the agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our operating results may not be sufficient to service our indebtedness or to fund our other expenditures and we may not be able to obtain financing to meet these requirements.\nVariable rate indebtedness that we have incurred or may incur under our credit agreement will subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nWe currently have $425 million of indebtedness outstanding under our term loan and no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Borrowings under the term loan are, and any borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be, at variable rates of interest. Indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates exposes us to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2019, our term loan bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% and the rate in effect was 4.44%. If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, then the annual interest and expense payments on the outstanding balance and rate in effect as of December 31, 2019 on the term loan would increase or decrease, respectively, $4.3 million. See also \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nRisks relating to the Separation\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve through the Separation.\nThe full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation may be delayed or may never occur at all. For instance, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract transaction partners using its capital stock as acquisition currency and that analysts and investors will regard its new corporate structure as more clear and simple than our current corporate structure.\nIf the Transactions, including the Separation and our subsequent merger, were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders could suffer material adverse consequences.\nIf the Transactions are implemented, following the completion of the Separation and the merger of Match Group into New Match Merger Sub (the \u201cMerger\u201d), our successor will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Match Group and most of IAC\u2019s existing other subsidiaries will be held under a separate public company. It is a\ncondition to each party\u2019s obligation to the Transaction Agreement that each of IAC, Match Group, and New IAC receive opinions of IAC\u2019s outside counsel, among other things, to the effect that the Separation and related transactions taken together, and the Merger, will be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinions of counsel will be based upon and rely on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of IAC, Match Group, and New IAC, including those relating to the past and future conduct of IAC, Match Group, and New IAC. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any of the representations or covenants contained in any of the transaction-related agreements and documents or in any document relating to the opinions of counsel are inaccurate or not complied with by IAC, Match Group, New IAC, or any of their respective subsidiaries, the opinions of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding receipt of the opinions of counsel regarding the transactions, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) could determine that some or all of the transactions effected in connection with the Transactions should be treated as taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinions of counsel were based are inaccurate or have not been complied with. Moreover, even if the foregoing representations, assumptions or undertakings are accurate and have been complied with, the opinions of counsel merely represent the judgment of such counsel and are not binding on the IRS or any court, and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of the opinions of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the transactions effected in connection with the Transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such a challenge, parties to the Transactions, including IAC (and its successor New Match Group) could be subject to tax with respect to the Transactions.\nFor example, if the transactions effected in connection with the Separation were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, IAC would recognize a taxable gain as if it had sold the New IAC stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value. Even if the transactions effected in connection with the Separation were to otherwise qualify as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, it may result in taxable gain to IAC under Section 355(e) of the Code if the transactions effected in connection with the Separation were later deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50 percent or greater interest (by vote or value) in IAC or New IAC. For this purpose, any acquisitions of IAC stock (or New Match stock after the merger) or New IAC stock within the period beginning two years before the Separation and ending two years after the Separation are presumed to be part of such a plan, although IAC or New IAC may be able to rebut that presumption.\nIf the Transactions are implemented, because our successor and our subsidiaries will form part of New Match Group\u2019s consolidated tax group (and because it is possible that our successor will be a disregarded entity, the regarded owner of which for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be New Match), we and our subsidiaries could be liable to satisfy any tax liabilities of New Match with respect to the Transactions if their tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes were successfully challenged by the IRS. While, in some cases, New IAC may be obligated under the Tax Matters Agreement to indemnify us for some or all of such taxes, even in those cases, there is no assurance that they will in fact indemnify us.\nIn addition, if the Merger were determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would be subject to tax on the transfer of our assets to New Match Merger Sub. Although, as discussed above, we expect that the Transactions will be respected as tax-free, there can be no assurance in this regard. If we, our successor or our subsidiaries were required to pay taxes imposed on IAC (and its successor New Match) with respect to the Transactions, our cash flows could be adversely affected.\nNew Match may not be able to engage in desirable capital-raising or strategic transactions following the Separation.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, a distribution that otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment can be rendered taxable to the distributing corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain post-distribution transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the corporation the stock of which is distributed. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the transactions effected in connection with the Separation, the tax matters\nagreement will impose certain restrictions on New Match and its subsidiaries during the two-year period following the Separation, except in specific circumstances, (1) ceasing to actively conduct certain of their businesses; (2) entering into certain transactions or series of transactions pursuant to which all or a portion of the shares of New Match common stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise; (3) liquidating or merging or consolidating with any other person; (4) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds; (5) repurchasing shares New Match common stock, other than in certain open-market transactions; or (6) taking or failing to take any other action that would cause the transactions effected in connection with the Separation to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. These restrictions may limit the ability of New Match to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions, repurchases or other transactions that it may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of its stockholders or that might increase the value of its business.\nAfter the Separation, actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between the management and directors of New IAC, on the one hand, and the management and directors of New Match, on the other hand.\nAfter the Separation, certain New Match directors and the management and directors of New IAC may own both New IAC common stock and New Match common stock. In addition, two of New Match\u2019s directors will be executives, and in one case, a director, of New IAC. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when New Match\u2019s directors and New IAC\u2019s management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for New IAC and New Match. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between New IAC and New Match regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Separation and the relationship between New IAC and New Match thereafter, including the transaction agreement, the employee matters agreement, the tax matters agreement, the transition services agreement, or any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if New IAC and New Match enter into any commercial arrangements in the future.\nIn addition, Joseph Levin will serve as the executive chairman of the New Match board of directors, while also serving as the Chief Executive Officer of New IAC, Glenn H. Schiffman will serve as a director of New Match while also serving as an executive officer of New IAC, and Alan G. Spoon will serve as a director of each of New Match and New IAC. The fact that Messrs. Levin, Schiffman, and Spoon will hold positions with both New IAC and New Match could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest for each of them when facing decisions that may affect both New IAC and New Match, and each of them also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his time between New IAC and New Match.\nThe Reclassification Exchange Ratio is a calculation that is subject to a number of factors that are outside of the control of IAC and Match Group and will not be known until just before the closing.\nThe number of shares of IAC Class M common stock into which shares of IAC common stock and IAC Class B common stock will be reclassified (which we refer to as the \u201cReclassification Exchange Ratio\u201d) is a calculation that will not be known until just before the closing of the Separation and is based on a variety of factors that are outside of the control of IAC and Match Group, including, among other things, the value of the exchangeable notes issued by the exchangeable notes issuers and related hedging instruments that will be retained by New Match, the cost of the New Match stock options to be received by IAC employees in respect of their existing IAC stock options, the number of shares of IAC Class M common stock (or New Match common stock), if any, sold in the IAC Class M equity offering and the number of shares of New Match common stock issued to non-IAC stockholders of Match Group in respect of additional stock elections and non-elections. Accordingly, Match Group stockholders will not know the number of shares of IAC Class M common stock into which the shares of IAC capital stock will be reclassified, and consequently the percentage interest in New Match represented by a share of New Match common stock, until after the date of the IAC annual meeting and the date of the Match special meeting.\nThe Separation is subject to certain closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the Separation not being completed, which may cause the market price of Match Group securities to decline.\nThe completion of the Separation is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of a number of conditions, including the receipt of certain approvals from the stockholders of IAC and Match Group and the absence of material litigation. Some of the conditions to the completion of the Separation are outside of the control of IAC and Match Group. If any condition to the closing of the Separation is not satisfied or waived, the Separation will\nnot be completed. In addition, IAC and Match Group may terminate the transaction agreement in certain circumstances.\nIf IAC and Match Group do not complete the Separation, the market price of Match Group securities may fluctuate to the extent that the current market prices of the shares reflect a market assumption that the Separation will be completed. Match Group will also be obligated to pay certain investment banking, financing, legal, and accounting fees and related expenses in connection with the Separation, whether or not the Separation is completed. In addition, Match Group has expended, and will continue to expend, significant management resources in an effort to complete the Separation. If the Separation is not completed, Match Group will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources, for which it will have received little or no benefit.\nNew Match may incur increased expenses if the transition services agreement with New IAC is terminated.\nIn connection with the Separation, New Match will enter into a transition services agreement and various other agreements with New IAC, pursuant to which New IAC will provide New Match with certain specified services on a transitional basis in areas where New Match may need assistance and support following the Separation. Depending on the particular service being provided, the agreements will extend for up to twelve months after the Separation, but may be terminated earlier under certain circumstances, including a default. If the transition services agreement is terminated, New Match may be required to obtain such services from a third party. This may be more expensive than the fees that New Match will be required to pay under the agreements with New IAC.\nAfter the Separation, New Match\u2019s certificate of incorporation could prevent New Match from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to New Match.\nSubject to obtaining the required approvals from the IAC stockholders, New Match\u2019s certificate of incorporation following the Separation is expected to have a \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d provision in which New Match and its affiliates renounce any interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to any of New Match\u2019s directors or officers who are also officers or directors of New IAC.\nGenerally, New Match\u2019s officers or directors who are also New IAC\u2019s officers or directors will not be liable to New Match or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary because such person fails to communicate or offer to New Match a corporate opportunity that has been communicated or offered to New IAC, that may also be a corporate opportunity of New Match or because such person communicates or offers to New IAC any corporate opportunity that may also be a corporate opportunity of New Match. In order for any New Match director or officer who is also a New IAC director or officer not to be liable to New Match or its stockholders, such opportunity cannot become known to the officer or director in his or her capacity as a New Match director or officer and cannot be presented to any party other than New IAC. In addition, such officer or director cannot pursue such opportunity in his or her individual capacity. The corporate opportunity provision may exacerbate conflicts of interest between New IAC and New Match because the provision effectively permits any of New Match\u2019s directors or officers who also serve as an officer or director of New IAC to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to New IAC instead of to New Match.\nExchange of the exchangeable notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of New Match common stock.\nIn connection with the Separation, New Match will retain IAC\u2019s obligations as a guarantor under the indentures relating to the exchangeable notes. Following completion of the Separation, the exchangeable notes will continue to be exchangeable into shares of New Match common stock in certain circumstances. The exchange of some or all of the exchangeable notes may dilute the ownership interests of New Match stockholders to the extent New Match delivers shares upon exchange of any of the exchangeable notes. While the exchangeable note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilutive effect on New Match common stock upon any exchange of exchangeable notes and/or offset any cash payment the issuers of the exchangeable notes would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of the exchanged notes, the warrants have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of New Match common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. Any sales in the public market of New Match common stock issuable upon such exchange could adversely affect prevailing market prices of New Match common stock. In addition, the existence of the exchangeable notes may encourage short selling of New Match common stock by market participants because the exchange of the exchangeable notes\ncould be used to satisfy short positions. In addition, the anticipated exchange of the exchangeable notes could depress the price of New Match common stock.\nThe shares of New Match common stock to be received by Match stockholders as a result of the Separation will have different rights from the shares of Match common stock and Match Class B common stock currently held.\nUpon completion of the Separation, Match Group stockholders will become New Match stockholders and their rights as stockholders will be governed by New Match\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Certain of the rights associated with New Match common stock are different from the rights associated with Match Group common stock and Class B common stock. For example, under New Match\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, New Match stockholders (i) will be entitled to one vote per share, (ii) will not have the power to call special meetings of stockholders, (iii) if approved by IAC stockholders at the IAC annual meeting, will not have the power to remove directors without cause and will not have the power to fill director vacancies and (iv) if approved by IAC stockholders at the IAC annual meeting, will not have the power to act by written consent.\nRisks relating to ownership of our common stock prior to the Separation\nThe multi-class structure of our capital stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with holders of our Class B common stock and limiting the ability of holders of our common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur publicly held common stock has one vote per share and our Class B common stock has ten votes per share. As of January 31, 2020, IAC owned all of the shares of our outstanding Class B common stock and 18,160,609 shares of our common stock, collectively representing approximately 80.7% of our outstanding shares of capital stock and approximately 97.5% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Due to the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B common stock and common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our capital stock, even when the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent a small minority of our outstanding capital stock, and such voting control will be concentrated with IAC. This concentrated control will significantly limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nThe difference in the voting rights of our common stock and our Class B common stock may harm the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nHolders of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share and holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share. The difference in the voting rights of our common stock and Class B common stock could harm the value of our common stock to the extent that any investor or potential future purchaser of our common stock ascribes value to the right of the holders of our Class B common stock to ten votes per share. The existence of two classes of common stock with different voting rights could result in less liquidity for either class of stock than if there were only one class of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nDuring 2019, our common stock closing price traded as high as $91.77 and as low as $41.12 and on February 26, 2020, the closing price of our common stock was $66.04. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose part of your investment in our common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of technology stocks generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022volatility in the market price of our common stock due to the limited number of shares of our common stock held by the public;\n\u2022sales of shares of our stock by us and/or our directors, executive officers, employees and stockholders;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, and any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new brands, products or services;\n\u2022the public\u2019s reaction to our earnings releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of (or changes to) existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022any significant change in our management or our board composition; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and slow or negative growth in any of our significant markets.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. We currently are, and in the future may be, the target of this type of litigation. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings.\u201d Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nYou may experience dilution due to the issuance of additional securities in the future.\nOur dilutive securities consist of vested and unvested options to purchase shares of our common stock, restricted stock unit awards, shares of our common stock issuable to IAC as reimbursement for the cost of vested and unvested IAC equity awards held by our employees and stock appreciation rights settled in IAC stock.\nThese dilutive securities are reflected in our share calculations underlying our dilutive earnings per share calculation contained in our financial statements for fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. For more information, see \u201cNote 10-Earnings per Share\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in \u201cItem 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Intra-quarter movements in our stock price, could lead to more or less dilution than reflected in these calculations.\nAt the option of IAC, the shares Match Group issues in connection with former subsidiary equity awards, which were converted into Match Group equity awards in 2017, will either be issued to holders of such awards or to IAC. In the event they are issued to IAC, IAC would in turn provide the equity holders with IAC shares of equivalent value to the Match Group shares issued to it. In cases where Match Group shares are issued directly to equity holders, recipients may sell such stock into the open market. If sales are significant and concentrated, these sales could have a temporary impact on the trading value of our stock.\nOur quarterly results or operating metrics could fluctuate significantly, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur quarterly results and operating metrics have fluctuated historically, and we expect that they could continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:\n\u2022the timing, size and effectiveness of our marketing efforts;\n\u2022fluctuations in the rate at which we attract new users, the level of engagement of such users and the propensity of such users to subscribe to our brands or to purchase \u00e0 la carte features;\n\u2022increases or decreases in our revenues and expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022the timing, size and effectiveness of non-marketing operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations, develop new products and remain competitive;\n\u2022the performance, reliability and availability of our technology, network systems and infrastructure and data centers;\n\u2022operational and financial risks we may experience in connection with historical and potential future acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022legal costs and settlements; and\n\u2022general economic conditions in either domestic or international markets.\nThe occurrence of any one of these factors, as well as other factors, or the cumulative effect of the occurrence of one or more of such factors could cause our quarterly results and operating metrics to fluctuate significantly. As a result, quarterly comparisons of results and operating metrics may not be meaningful.\nIn addition, the variability and unpredictability of our quarterly results or operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations, or those of any of our investors or of analysts that cover our company, with respect to revenues or other operating results for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our common stock could fall substantially.\nWe do not expect to declare any regular cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe paid a special cash dividend in December 2018; however, we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock and Class B common stock. Instead, we anticipate that all of our future earnings will be retained to support our operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made by our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our historical and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations;\n\u2022our capital levels and needs;\n\u2022tax considerations;\n\u2022any acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may consider;\n\u2022statutory and regulatory prohibitions and other limitations;\n\u2022the terms of any credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements that restrict our ability to pay cash dividends, including the Match Group Credit Agreement and the indentures relating to the Match Group Senior Notes;\n\u2022general economic conditions; and\n\u2022other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nWe are not obligated to pay dividends on our common stock or Class B common stock. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking regular cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nDelaware corporate law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous, including provisions which:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022provide that certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware; and\n\u2022provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15850, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MTCH.5"}
