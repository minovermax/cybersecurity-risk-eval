The factors listed below are important because they could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report, in our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases, written or electronic communications, and verbal statements by our representatives.\nYou should be aware that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause our or our industry\u2019s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words like \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d and other similar expressions that convey uncertainty about future events or outcomes. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCompetition may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nThe restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, nutritional and dietary trends and food quality, and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, economic conditions, population and traffic patterns. We compete\nwithin each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains, some of which operate more restaurants and have greater financial resources and longer operating histories than ours. The U.S. total employment market is growing, and there is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. We continue to face competition as a result of several factors, including quick service and fast casual restaurants also offering high quality food and beverage choices and the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs.\nOur restaurants also face competition from the introduction of new products and menu items by competitors, as well as substantial price discounting among other offers, and are likely to continue to face such future competition in light of the slow paced economic growth. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict and will be influenced by competitive product offerings, pricing and promotions offered by competitors. Our ability to differentiate our brands from their competitors, which is in part limited by the advertising spend available to us and by consumer perception, cannot be assured. These factors could reduce the gross sales or profitability at our restaurants, which would decrease revenues or profitability generated by company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchisees.\nChanging health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The foodservice industry as a whole rests on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, national and international levels, including the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet, nutrition, health and health insurance. We and our franchisees depend on the sustained demand for our products, which may be affected by factors outside of our control. Changes in nutritional or health insurance guidelines issued by federal or local government agencies, issuance of similar guidelines or statistical information by other federal, state or local municipalities, academic studies, or advocacy organizations, among other things, may impact consumer choice and cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our company-owned restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.\nThe slow global economic growth continues to impact consumer discretionary spending and a continued and prolonged slow trend in growth could result in declines in consumer discretionary spending materially affecting our financial performance in the future.\nThe restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending. Despite improvement in total employment and consumer confidence in the U.S., consumer incomes have been slow to recover and discretionary income for restaurant visits has been challenged. Economic improvement in the restaurant industry continues to come from cost savings initiatives as well as our success to improve the guest experience within our existing restaurant locations. If this current slow economic growth continues for a prolonged period of time and/or deepens in magnitude returning to the negative trends of the prior years, our business, results of operations and ability to comply with the covenants under our credit facility could be materially affected. Deterioration in guest traffic and/or a reduction in the average amount guests spend in our restaurants will negatively impact our revenues. This will also result in lower royalties collected, sales deleverage, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. This could result in further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures.\nFuture slow global economic growth or recessionary effects on us are unknown at this time and could have a potential material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. There is no assurance that any governmental plan to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will foster growth in consumer confidence, stabilize the financial markets, increase liquidity and the availability of credit, or result in lower unemployment.\nInflation may increase our operating expenses.\nWe have experienced impact from inflation. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu prices, or by reviewing, then implementing, alternative products or processes, or other cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.\nChanges in governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants.\nWe are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), along with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters, including, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status. We have experienced and continue to expect adjustments in payroll expenses as a result of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage; we cannot be certain there will be no additional significant increases in the future. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for our restaurants in a particular area or across the United States. Other labor shortages or increased team member turnover could also increase labor costs. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. We continue to review the Affordable Care Act and regulations issued related to the law to evaluate the potential impact of this law on our business, and to accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, relating to nutritional content and menu labeling. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We do not expect to incur material costs from compliance with the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring disclosure of calories on the menus, but cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of this portion of the law, which could have adverse effects on our sales or results of operations.\nEach of our company-owned and our franchisees\u2019 restaurants is also subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state, county and/or municipality where the restaurant is located. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses and approvals that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Although we do not, at this time, anticipate any occurring in the future, we cannot be certain that we, or our franchisees, will not experience material difficulties or failures that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay the opening of restaurants in the future.\nWe are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative affect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the U.S. and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. This may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an unspecified array of environmental matters. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance. Further, more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay, prevent or make cost prohibitive the continuing operations of an existing restaurant or the development of new restaurants in particular locations.\nDue to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees and joint venture partners. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse affect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nShortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues.\nPossible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tight credit market; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; animal disease outbreaks (such as the avian\nflu outbreak in the midwestern U.S. in 2015); or other conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.\nOur profitability may be adversely affected by increases in energy costs.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs, in particular, electricity and natural gas. Various regions of the United States in which we operate multiple restaurants have experienced volatility in utility prices. This has affected costs in the past and if they occur again, it would have possible adverse effects on our profitability to the extent not otherwise recoverable through price increases or alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. Further, higher prices for petroleum-based fuels may be passed on to us by suppliers putting further pressure on margins as well as impact our guests discretionary funds and ability to patron our restaurants or their menu choices.\nSuccessful strategic transactions are important to our future growth and profitability.\nWe evaluate potential franchisees of new and existing restaurants and joint venture investments, as well as mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, as part of our strategic planning initiative. These transactions involve various inherent risks, including accurately assessing:\n\u2022\nthe value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of franchise and joint venture partner candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business or the completion of a divestiture.\nWe acquired Pepper Dining Holding Corp., a franchisee with 103 Chili's restaurants in the northeastern and southeastern U.S. on June 25, 2015. These acquired restaurants have lower annual average sales volumes and different margin structures than our company-owned Chili's restaurants. We are integrating the acquired restaurants into our Chili's operations structure and are rolling out processes to improve sales and margins. We are also reimaging these restaurants and leveraging technology investments in the restaurants. There is no assurance that these initiatives will achieve the sales growth and margin improvements for which we have planned, and would not adversely impact our profitability in the future if not met.\nIf we are unable to meet our business strategy plan, our profitability in the future may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincrease gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options and high quality service desired by our guests through successful implementation of strategic initiatives;\n\u2022\nidentify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including reimaging of existing restaurants, new restaurant development and new equipment;\n\u2022\nidentify available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants;\n\u2022\nobtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nhire all necessary contractors and subcontractors, obtain construction materials at suitable prices, and maintain construction schedules; and\n\u2022\nhire and train or retain qualified managers and team members for existing and new restaurants.\nThe current slow economic growth could have a material adverse impact on our landlords or other tenants in retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located, which in turn could negatively affect our financial results.\nIf the slow economic growth continues or returns to prior recessionary levels, our landlords may be unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition, other tenants at retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located or have executed leases, may fail to open or may cease operations. If our landlords fail to satisfy required co-tenancies, this may result in us or our franchisees terminating leases or delaying openings in these locations. Also, decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers in which we are located may affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nThe success of our franchisees is important to our future growth.\nWe have a significant percentage of system-wide restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to maintain brand consistency, the franchise relationship reduces our direct day-to-day oversight of these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control. These risks include\nfranchisee defaults in their obligations to us arising from financial or other difficulties encountered by them, such as payments to us or maintenance and improvements obligations; limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; inability to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; inability to meet rent obligations on leases on which we retain contingent liability; and failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements subjecting us to litigation even when we are not legally liable for a franchisee\u2019s actions or failure to act.\nAdditionally our international franchisees and joint venture partners are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to U.S. operations;\n\u2022\nchanges to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;\n\u2022\nchallenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and\n\u2022\ndifferences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, cultural, social and political conditions.\nOur sales volumes generally decrease in winter months in North America.\nOur sales volumes fluctuate seasonally and are generally higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months, which may cause seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.\nUnfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand.\nMulti-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness or health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili\u2019s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili\u2019s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili\u2019s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of electronic communication, including social media. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business.\nThere has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects, or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. The dissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information's accuracy.\nMany of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social medial platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete. As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance. As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests. We have initiated a multi-year effort to implement new technology platforms that will allow us to digitally engage with our guests and employees and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in this increasingly connected society. The initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues, increased employee engagement or brand recognition. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.\nLitigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance.\nWe are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity.\nSignificant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on information technology and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.\nWe rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. A security breach or cyber attack could include theft of credit card data or other personal information as well as our intellectual property. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.\nAdditionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.\nFailure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our guests and teammates and confidential and proprietary information of the company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues and litigation.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and team members in our information technology systems, such as point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including our rewards program. Additionally our systems contain proprietary and confidential information related to our business. Use of this information is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by certain third party contracts. If our or our business associates' information systems are compromised as a result of a cyber attack or other external or internal method, or we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in a violation of the laws and regulations, and an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, results of operations and financial condition. Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us or the imposition of penalties. These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack, failure or to have failed to properly respond to an incident. Like many other retail companies, we experience frequent attempts to compromise our systems but none have resulted in a material breach. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur additional costs in technology, third party services and personnel to remain in compliance and maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks. Our security frameworks prevent breaches of our systems and data loss, but these measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\nFailure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.\nWe regard our Chili's\u00ae and Maggiano's\u00ae service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons. Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate, and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.\nWe outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.\nSome business processes are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes include certain information technology processes, gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain\npayroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks to guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.\nDisruptions in the global financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit and consumer spending patterns.\nPrevious disruptions to the global financial markets and continuing slow economic recovery have adversely impacted the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future. The disruptions in the financial markets also had an adverse effect on the U.S. and world economy, which has negatively impacted consumer spending patterns. There can be no assurance that various U.S. and world government present and future responses to the previous disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity or the availability of credit.\nDeclines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nChanges to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets.\nWe make certain estimates and projections with regards to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. The projection of future cash flows used in this analysis requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIdentification of material weakness in internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Those provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. If such a material weakness is identified, it could indicate a lack of adequate controls to generate accurate financial statements. We routinely assess our internal control over financial reporting, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting team members, especially in light of the increased demand for such individuals among publicly traded companies.\nOther risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOther risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending and consumer confidence, include, without limitation, changes in economic conditions and financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates and costs for consumers and reduced disposable income); credit availability; increased costs of food commodities; increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events; consumer perceptions of food safety; changes in consumer tastes and behaviors; governmental monetary policies; changes in demographic trends; availability of employees; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms) and other acts of God.", "PERMNO": 23297, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "EAT"}
