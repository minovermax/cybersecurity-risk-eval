{"cik": "1006424", "company": "BEAR STATE FINANCIAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully read and consider the risk factors described below as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the information contained in other filings with the SEC. Any of these risks, if they actually occur, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may materially and adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Business:\nOur profitability is dependent on our banking activities.\nBecause we are a bank holding company, our profitability is directly attributable to the success of our bank subsidiary. Our banking activities compete with other banking institutions on the basis of service, convenience and price. Due in part to regulatory changes and consumer demands, banks have experienced increased competition from other entities offering similar products and services. We rely on the profitability of our bank subsidiary and dividends received from our bank subsidiary for payment of our operating expenses and satisfaction of our obligations. As is the case with other similarly situated financial institutions, our profitability will be subject to the fluctuating cost and availability of funds, changes in the prime lending rate and other interest rates, changes in economic conditions in general and, because of the location of our banking offices, changes in economic conditions in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma in particular.\nChanges in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s profitability and asset values.\nThe operations of financial institutions such as the Bank are dependent to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and investment securities and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect net interest income by affecting the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, or interest rate spread, and the average life of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates also can affect our ability to originate loans; the value of our interest earning assets; our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and the ability of borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank\u2019s model simulations projected that 100, 200 and 300 basis point increases in interest rates would result in variances in net interest income of less than 2%, relative to the base case over the next twelve months and decreases in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in a negative variance in net interest income of approximately 7% relative to the base case over the next twelve months. Based on these measures, the Bank estimates a limited impact on earnings for various interest rate change scenarios. Significant changes in the composition of our rate sensitive assets or liabilities could result in a more unbalanced position possibly causing interest rate changes to have a material impact on our earnings. In addition, earnings may be adversely affected during any period of changes in interest rates due to a number of factors including among other items, call features and interest rate caps and floors on various assets and liabilities, prepayments, the current interest rates on assets and liabilities to be repriced in each period, and the relative changes in interest rates on different types of assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, a significant and prolonged increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale and, accordingly, stockholders\u2019 equity. At December 31, 2016 the Bank had investment securities classified as available for sale with a fair value of $188.5 million with a net unrealized loss of $2.3 million. The impact on equity at December 31, 2016, net of tax, was an unrealized loss of $1.4 million.\nThe Company and the Bank face strong competition that may adversely affect profitability.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to vigorous competition in all aspects and areas of our business from banks and other financial institutions, including commercial banks, savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies, credit unions and other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies and insurance companies, and with non-financial institutions, including retail stores that maintain their own credit programs and governmental agencies that make available low cost or guaranteed loans to certain borrowers. Many of our competitors are larger financial institutions with substantially greater resources, lending limits, and larger branch systems. These competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services. Competition from both bank and non-bank organizations will continue. Our inability to compete successfully could adversely affect profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could experience deficiencies in our allowance for loan and lease losses.\nManagement maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses based upon, among other things:\n\u2022 historical experience;\n\u2022 repayment capacity of borrowers;\n\u2022 an evaluation of local, regional and national economic conditions;\n\u2022 regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality;\n\u2022 collateral evaluations;\n\u2022 current trends regarding the volume and severity of problem loans;\n\u2022 the existence and effect of concentrations of credit; and\n\u2022 results of regulatory examinations.\nBased on these factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loans in the portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and management must make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. In addition, the board of directors and the regulatory authorities periodically review the allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. Regulators\u2019 judgments may differ from management. While management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is appropriate based on our evaluation, management may determine that an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses is needed or regulators may require an increase in the allowance. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nA new accounting standard may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company and the Bank for our fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on key personnel for our success.\nOur operating results and ability to adequately manage our growth and minimize loan and lease losses are highly dependent on the services, managerial abilities and performance of our current executive officers and other key personnel. While we have an experienced management team that the Board believes is capable of managing and growing our business, recent executive departures and restructuring of senior management have resulted in the transition of many management positions within the Company and the Bank. Additional losses of or changes in our current executive officers or other key personnel and their responsibilities may disrupt our business and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current executive officers or other key personnel, or hiring additional key personnel to assist in executing our growth strategy.\nFurther, the process of identifying management successors creates uncertainty and could become a distraction to our senior management and the Board. We may not be successful in attracting qualified candidates to replace key positions when necessary. As a result, the transition process and the identification and recruitment of candidates to fill senior management positions may be disruptive to our business or operations.\nOur business depends on the condition of the local and regional economies where we operate.\nAll of our banking offices are located in Arkansas, Missouri and Southeast Oklahoma. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be significantly impacted by changes in the Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma economies. Slowdown in economic activity, deterioration in housing markets or increases in unemployment and under-employment in these areas may have a significant and disproportionate impact on consumer and business confidence and the demand for our products and services, result in an increase in non-payment of loans and leases and a decrease in collateral value, and significantly impact our deposit funding sources. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nA portion of the loan portfolio is related to commercial real estate and construction activities. Unexpected declines in real estate values and other market uncertainties may negatively impact these loans and could adversely impact results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 46% of loans consisted of commercial real estate or construction project loans. Commercial real estate and construction lending are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk due to a variety of factors, including generally larger loan balances, the dependency on successful completion or operation of the project for repayment, a need for a general stability of interest rates and loan terms that often do not require full amortization of the loan over its term and, instead, provide for a balloon payment at stated maturity. In recent years, commercial real estate markets have been experiencing substantial growth, and increased competitive pressures have contributed significantly to historically low capitalization rates and rising property values. Commercial real estate prices, according to many U.S. commercial real estate indices, are currently above the 2007 peak levels that contributed to the recent financial crisis. Accordingly, federal bank regulatory agencies have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current commercial real estate market. Our failure to adequately implement and execute effective underwriting and risk management policies, procedures and controls with respect to commercial real estate lending could adversely affect our ability to increase this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses, from this portfolio.\nThe Company and the Bank could be materially and adversely affected if any of our officers or directors fails to comply with bank and other laws and regulations.\nLike any business, we are subject to risk arising from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies. Any interventions by regulatory authorities following such employee misconduct may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, suspension or expulsion of our officers or directors from the banking industry. In addition to the monetary consequences, these measures could, for example, impact our ability to engage in, or impose limitations on, certain business activities. Significant regulatory action against the Company or the Bank or its officers or directors could materially and adversely affect the Company and the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm.\nThe Bank may incur increased employee benefit costs which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is a participant in the multiemployer Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan (the \u201cPentegra DB Plan\u201d). Since the Pentegra DB Plan is a multiemployer plan, contributions of participating employers are commingled and invested on a pooled basis without allocation to specific employers or employees. Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. In addition, if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the multiemployer plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.\nAlthough the Pentegra DB Plan has been frozen since July 1, 2010, the Company has continued to incur costs consisting of administration and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insurance expenses as well as amortization charges based on the funding level of the Pentegra DB Plan. The level of amortization charges is determined by the Pentegra DB Plan's funding shortfall, which is determined by comparing the Pentegra DB Plan\u2019s liabilities to the Pentegra DB Plan\u2019s assets. Net pension expense was approximately $156,000, $138,000 and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and contributions to the Pentegra DB Plan totaled $162,000, $148,000 and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company elected to retire certain pension liabilities of the Pentegra DB Plan which resulted in a charge of $2.9 million. Although this election improved the funding status, material increases to the estimated amount of the Bank\u2019s required contribution may occur. Additionally, if the Bank were to terminate its participation in the Pentegra DB Plan, the Bank could incur a significant withdrawal liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nAn inability to make technological advances may reduce the Company and the Bank\u2019s ability to successfully compete.\nThe banking industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology. In addition to improving customer services, effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. As a result, the Company and the Bank\u2019s future success will depend in part on the ability to address customers\u2019 needs by using technology. The Company and the Bank may be unable to effectively develop new technology-driven products and services and may be unsuccessful in marketing these products to our customers. Many competitors have greater resources to invest in technology. Any failure to keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings.\nThe financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber-attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions.\nWe have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches.\nWe also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processors, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers' transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.\nOur customers are also the target of cyber-attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.\nThe occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risks.\nA significant portion of our loan and lease portfolio is secured by real property. In the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to real properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. Additionally, we have acquired a number of retail banking facilities and other real properties as a result of the FNSC and Metropolitan acquisitions, any of which may contain hazardous or toxic substances. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. We have policies and procedures that require either formal or informal evaluation of environmental risks and liabilities on real property (i) before originating any loan or foreclosure action, except for (a) loans originated for sale in the secondary market secured by one-to-four family residential properties and (b) certain loans where the real estate collateral is second lien collateral. These policies, procedures and evaluations may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf we do not properly manage our credit risk, our business could be seriously harmed.\nThere are substantial risks inherent in making any loan or lease, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25a0\nrisks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions;\n\u25a0\nrisks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers;\n\u25a0\nrisks inherent from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral; and\n\u25a0\nthe risk of non-payment of loans and leases.\nAlthough we attempt to minimize our credit risk through prudent loan and lease underwriting procedures and by monitoring concentrations of our loans and leases, there can be no assurance that these underwriting and monitoring procedures will reduce these risks. Moreover, as we expand into new markets, credit administration and loan and lease underwriting policies and procedures may need to be adapted to local conditions. The inability to properly manage our credit risk or appropriately adapt our credit administration and loan and lease underwriting policies and procedures to local market conditions or changing economic circumstances could have an adverse impact on our provision for loan and lease losses and our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe rely on certain external vendors.\nWe are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements. We maintain a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks including, among other things, (i) changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, (ii) changes in the vendor\u2019s financial condition and (iii) changes in the vendor\u2019s support for existing products and services. While we believe these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or the service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed and potential acquisitions.\nWe have pursued and expect to pursue additional acquisition opportunities that we believe support our business strategy and may enhance our profitability. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf\nincurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in our attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u25cf\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u25cf\nthe risk that the acquired business will not perform to our expectations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties, inefficiencies or cost overruns in integrating and assimilating the organizational cultures, operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired business with ours;\n\u25cf\nthe risk of key vendors not fulfilling our expectations or not accurately converting data;\n\u25cf\nentering geographic and product markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers and deposits of acquired banks;\n\u25cf\nthe potential for liabilities and claims arising out of the acquired businesses; and\n\u25cf\nthe risk of not receiving required regulatory approvals or such approvals being restrictively conditional.\nAcquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties, and acquired companies may have unknown or contingent liabilities with no corresponding accounting allowance, exposure to unexpected asset quality problems that require writedowns or write-offs (as well as restructuring and impairment or other charges), difficulty retaining key employees and customers and other issues that could negatively affect our business. We may not be able to realize any projected cost savings, synergies or other benefits associated with any such acquisition we complete. Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations could increase our operating costs significantly and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions prior to completing any acquisition, including, in certain cases, federal and state regulatory approval. Bank regulators consider a number of factors when determining whether to approve a proposed transaction, including the effect of the transaction on financial stability and the ratings and compliance history of all institutions involved, including Community Reinvestment Act compliance, examination results and anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance records of all institutions involved. The process for obtaining required regulatory approvals has become substantially more difficult as a result of the recent financial crisis, which could affect our future business. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant business opportunities as a result of our inability, or our perceived inability, to obtain any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all.\nIn addition, we face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions, many of which will have greater financial resources than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any future acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Our Industry:\nThe Company and the Bank operate in a heavily regulated environment, and that regulation could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated and we are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies, including the ASBD, the FRB and the FDIC. Compliance with these regulations is costly and may restrict some of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates and locations of offices. The regulators\u2019 interpretation and application of relevant regulations are beyond our control and may change rapidly and unpredictably. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and not stockholders.\nIn response to the financial crisis, the banking and financial services industry has been the subject of increased legislation and regulation. While recent trends may have shown a likelihood of continued expansion of financial services regulation, at this time, it is difficult to predict future legislative and regulatory changes that will result from the combination of a new President of the United States and the first year since 2010 in which both Houses of Congress have majority memberships from the same political party as the President. In recent years, however, both the new President and senior members of the House of Representatives have advocated for significant reduction of financial services regulation, to include amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and structural changes to the CFPB. The new Administration and Congress also may cause broader economic changes due to changes in governing ideology and governing style. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, our results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nThe FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which may affect our net interest income and net interest margin. Changes in the supply of money and credit can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities. The FRB\u2019s policies can also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans and leases. Changes in such policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict; consequently, the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.\nReductions in interchange fees would reduce our non-interest income.\nAn interchange fee is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the network\u2019s infrastructure and payment facilitation, and which is paid to debit, credit and prepaid card issuers to compensate them for the costs associated with card issuance and operation. In the case of credit cards, this includes the risk associated with lending money to customers. We earn interchange fees on these card transactions. Merchants, trying to decrease their operating expenses, have sought to, and have had some success at, lowering interchange rates. In particular, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act limited the amount of interchange fees that may be charged for debit and prepaid card transactions for those card issuers with $10 billion or more in total assets. Several recent events and actions indicate a continuing focus on interchange fees by both regulators and merchants. Beyond pursuing litigation, legislation and regulation, merchants are also pursuing alternate payment platforms as a means to lower payment processing costs. To the extent interchange fees are further reduced, our non-interest income from those fees will be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the payment card industry is subject to the operating regulations and procedures set forth by payment card networks, and our failure to comply with these operating regulations, which may change from time to time, could subject us to various penalties or fees or the termination of our license to use the payment card networks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock:\nThe trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock is lower than that of other financial services companies and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which can make it difficult to sell shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at times, volumes and prices attractive to our stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \u201cBSF.\u201d The average daily trading volume for shares of our common stock is lower than larger financial institutions. Because the trading volume of our common stock is lower, and thus has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for many other publicly traded companies, sales of our common stock may place significant downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. In addition, market value of thinly traded stocks can be more volatile than stocks trading in an active public market.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, in addition to those described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results, cash flows and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nchanges in earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to us or other financial institutions;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation or the financial services industry;\n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions, financings or stock repurchases;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nabnormally high trading volumes in our common stock;\n\u25cf\nfuture issuances or re-sales of our equity or equity-related securities, or the perception that they may occur;\n\u25cf\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u25cf\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings, or litigation or accounting matters that involve or affect us;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, and market prices for the stock of many companies, including those in the financial services sector, have experienced wide price fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to operating performance. This is due, in part, to investors\u2019 shifting perceptions of the effect of changes and potential changes in the economy on various industry sectors. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including for reasons unrelated to their performance or prospects. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, notwithstanding our actual or anticipated operating results, cash flows and financial condition. The Company expects that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate due to many factors, including prevailing interest rates, other economic conditions, our operating performance and investor perceptions of the outlook for the Company and the Bank specifically and the banking industry in general.\nAs a result of the lower trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock and its susceptibility to market price volatility, stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at times, volumes or prices they find attractive.\nBear State Financial Holdings, LLC holds a significant interest in the Company\u2019s common stock and may have interests that differ from the interests of other stockholders.\nBear State Financial Holdings, LLC (\u201cBSF Holdings\u201d) currently owns approximately 40% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock. As a result, BSF Holdings is able to significantly influence corporate and management policies and the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to Company stockholders for approval. Such transactions may include mergers and acquisitions, sales of all or some of the Company\u2019s assets or purchases of assets, and other significant corporate transactions.\nThe interests of BSF Holdings may differ from those of the Company\u2019s other stockholders, and it may take actions that advance its interests to the detriment of other stockholders.\nThis concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination that could be favorable to the other holders of the Company\u2019s common stock, and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be adversely affected by the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.\nShares of Company common stock are not an insured deposit and are subject to substantial investment risk.\nInvestments in Company common stock are not a savings or deposit account or other obligation of the Bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency. Investment in Company common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \"RISK FACTORS\" section, and is subject to the same market forces that affect the market price of the common stock of any company. As a result, you may lose some or all of your investment.\nFuture issuances of additional equity securities could result in dilution of existing stockholders\u2019 equity ownership.\nWe may determine from time to time to issue additional equity securities to raise additional capital, support growth, or, as we have in recent years, to make acquisitions. Further, we may issue stock options, grant restricted stock awards or other equity awards to retain, compensate and/or motivate our employees and directors. These issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 83504, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "BSF"}
