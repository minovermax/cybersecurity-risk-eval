Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the information included in this Annual Report and our other filings with the SEC, before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. We believe the risks and uncertainties described below are the most significant we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The following is a summary of the principal risk factors described in this section:\n\u25cf\nOur financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 were, and our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 and beyond may be, adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.\n\u25cf\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\n\u25cf\nOur level of indebtedness and the terms of the Financing Agreement, dated as of April 24, 2019, as amended, with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., as administrative agent, or the Administrative Agent or Sixth Street, various lenders from time to time party thereto, and certain of our subsidiaries party thereto from time to time as guarantors, or the Financing Agreement, could adversely affect our operations and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business. If we are unable to comply with certain net revenue and minimum unrestricted cash covenants and other restrictions in the Financing Agreement, the repayment of our existing indebtedness could be accelerated.\n\u25cf\nWe may not recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed disposition of vitaCare Prescription Services or any other divestitures we may pursue in the future.\n\u25cf\nWe currently derive all of our revenue from sales or licenses of our women\u2019s healthcare products, and our failure to maintain or increase sales of these products could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n\u25cf\nThe commercial success of our existing products and other pharmaceutical products that we may develop, if approved in the future, will depend upon gaining and retaining significant market acceptance of these products among physicians and payers.\n\u25cf\nWe may not be able to complete the commercialization of our pharmaceutical products and development of future product candidates if we fail to obtain additional financing.\n\u25cf\nCoverage and reimbursement may not be available for our products, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably, or if available, government mandated rebates may be too high and may adversely affect our profitability.\n\u25cf\nOur dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of our existing women\u2019s healthcare products and our pharmaceutical product candidates may cause delays in, or prevent us from, successfully developing, commercializing, and marketing our products.\n\u25cf\nLicensing of intellectual property involves complex legal, business and scientific issues, and disputes could jeopardize our rights under such agreements. Additionally, our current licensing agreements contain limitations and restrictions that could limit or adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize other products in the future.\n\u25cf\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property covering our hormone therapy pharmaceutical products and other products are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\n\u25cf\nOur products face significant competition from branded and generic products, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\n\u25cf\nOur success is tied to our distribution channels.\n\u25cf\nWe will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 were, and our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 and beyond may be, adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.\nOur business has been, and we anticipate that it will continue to be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the fourth quarter of 2020, all of our products remained affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily due to our sales force having limited access to healthcare professionals and our patients deferring visits to healthcare professionals in certain areas. While we have developed a comprehensive COVID-19 contingency plan designed to preserve the value of our investments in our sales and marketing infrastructure, protect our balance sheet during this period of market disruption, and meet the needs of our patients and prescribers, the severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.\nStay at home, quarantine and social distancing orders and closures and restrictions on travel have negatively affected the ability of our sales force to access healthcare providers to promote our products and the ability of patients to visit their healthcare professionals for non-emergent matters. Our sales force is continuing to use a hybrid model of office visits when necessary and digital engagement tools and tactics and virtual detailing, which may be less effective than our ordinary course sales and marketing programs. Increases in unemployment could reduce access to commercial health insurance for our patients, thus limiting payer coverage for our products, which could lead to increased use of our co-pay assistance programs and negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur future results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected by, and we may require an increased level of working capital as a result of, extended billing and collection cycles as a result of displaced employees at our company, payers, revenue cycle management contractors, or otherwise; delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms; supply chain disruptions; uncertain demand; and the impact of any initiatives or programs that we may undertake to address financial and operations challenges that we may face.\nAdditionally, although we currently continue to have uninterrupted wholesale and retail distribution of our products and we do not anticipate a shortage of our products due to COVID-19 at this time, disruptions may occur for our customers or suppliers that may affect our ability to obtain supplies or other components for our products, manufacture additional products or deliver inventory in a timely manner. This would result in lost sales, additional costs, or penalties, or damage to our reputation.\nOur business may also be affected by negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on capital markets and economies worldwide, and it is possible that the pandemic could cause a local and/or global economic recession. While policymakers globally have responded with fiscal policy actions to support the healthcare industry and economy as a whole, the magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remains uncertain.\nWe may also experience other unknown impacts from COVID-19 that cannot be predicted. Accordingly, disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19 could continue to result in an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects in the near-term and beyond 2021.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred recurring net losses, including net losses of approximately $184 million, $176 million, and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $879 million. We have generated limited revenue and have funded our operations to date primarily from public and private sales of equity and private sales of debt securities. We may incur substantial additional losses over the next few years because of our commercialization, research, development, and clinical trial activities. As a result, we may never achieve or maintain profitability, even if we successfully commercialize all of our pharmaceutical products. If we continue to incur substantial losses and are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to discontinue or curtail our business operations, sell assets at unfavorable prices, refinance then-existing debt obligations on terms unfavorable to us, or merge, consolidate, or combine with a company with greater financial resources in a transaction that might be unfavorable to us.\nOur level of indebtedness and the terms of the Financing Agreement could adversely affect our operations and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business. If we are unable to comply with certain net revenue covenants and other restrictions in the Financing Agreement, the repayment of our existing indebtedness could be accelerated.\nUnder the Financing Agreement, we have incurred a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business. In April 2019, we drew down the first tranche of $200.0 million under the Financing Agreement and in February 2020 we drew down the second tranche of $50.0 million under the Financing Agreement. On March 1, 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 8 to the Financing Agreement, or Amendment No. 8, pursuant to which we, among other things, repaid $15.0 million in principal under the Financing Agreement on such date and agreed to repay an additional $35.0 million in principal by no later than March 31, 2021, in each case plus a 5.0% prepayment fee. Our high level of indebtedness could affect our business in the following ways, among other things: make it more difficult for us to satisfy our contractual and commercial commitments; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal, which would reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments or general corporate purposes; heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy; place us at a disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that may have proportionately less debt; limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business; and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy.\nThe Financing Agreement requires us to make certain payments of principal and interest over time and contains certain minimum quarterly net product revenue requirements and several other restrictive covenants. We are required to achieve total minimum net revenue for ANNOVERA, IMVEXXY, and BIJUVA equal to at least (i) $17.0 million, $20.0 million, $23.0 million, and $26.5 million for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively, (ii) $30.0 million, $35.0 million, $40.0 million and $45.0 million for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively, (iii) $50.0 million, $55.0 million, $60.0 million and $65.5 million for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2023, and (iv) $70.0 million for the first quarter of 2024. Among other requirements of the Financing Agreement, we and our subsidiaries party to the Financing Agreement must maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of $60.0 million, less the amount of certain payables. The Financing Agreement also contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of us and our subsidiaries party to the Financing Agreement to (i) incur indebtedness, (ii) incur liens on our property, (iii) pay dividends or make other distributions, (iv) sell our assets, (v) make certain loans or investments, (vi) merge or consolidate, (vii) voluntarily repay or prepay certain permitted indebtedness and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. These and other terms in the Financing Agreement have to be monitored closely for compliance and could restrict our ability to grow our business or enter into transactions that we believe would be beneficial to our business. In order to maintain compliance with the minimum unrestricted cash balance requirement of the Financing Agreement, we anticipate that we may need to raise additional capital. We cannot guarantee that future financing sufficient to maintain or exceed the minimum unrestricted cash balance will be available in sufficient amounts, in a timely fashion, or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to maintain the minimum unrestricted cash balance, achieve any of the total minimum net revenue requirements or otherwise comply with any other covenant of the Financing Agreement, all or a portion of our obligations under the Financing Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and support our growth strategies, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, including under our current debt obligations.\nWe may not be able to complete the commercialization of our pharmaceutical products and development of future product candidates if we fail to obtain additional financing.\nWe need substantial amounts of cash to complete the commercialization of IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA and the clinical development and commercialization of future pharmaceutical product candidates. Our existing cash may not be sufficient to fund these requirements. In addition, changing circumstances may cause us to consume funds significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected on these programs. We may attempt to raise additional capital from the issuance of equity securities, collaborations with third parties, licensing of rights to our products, the issuance of debt securities and the incurrence of debt, in each case to the extent permitted under the Financing Agreement, or other means, or a combination of any of the foregoing. Securing additional financing will require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of management\u2019s attention away from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to conduct our day-to-day operations.\nWe cannot guarantee that future debt or equity financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue our commercialization and product development efforts.\nThe Financing Agreement does, and any agreements governing future debt financing, if available, may, include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or proposed products or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing commercialization and development efforts, and our ability to generate revenue and achieve or sustain profitability will be substantially harmed.\nWe may not recognize any anticipated benefits of the proposed disposition of vitaCare Prescription Services or any other divestitures we may pursue in the future.\nWe have commenced a process for the divestiture of vitaCare Prescription Services. Additionally, we may evaluate other potential divestiture opportunities with respect to portions of our business from time to time, and may determine to proceed with a divestiture opportunity if and when we believe such opportunity is consistent with our business strategy and we would be able to realize value for our stockholders in so doing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell vitaCare Prescription Services. Any divestiture or disposition, including the potential disposition of vitaCare Prescription Services, could expose us to significant risks, including, without limitation, fees for legal and transaction-related services, diversion of management resources, transaction execution risks (including risks resulting from buyer financing and due diligence contingencies and other closing conditions), loss of key personnel and reduction in revenue. Further, we may be required to retain or indemnify a buyer against certain liabilities and obligations in connection with any such divestiture, and we may also become subject to third-party claims arising out of such divestiture. In addition, we may not achieve the expected price in a divestiture transaction, including the potential sale of vitaCare Prescription Services. A divesture of vitaCare Prescription Services may be subject to various third-party consents. There can be no assurances that we will obtain any necessary consents of governmental authorities or other third parties that might be required in order for us to sell vitaCare Prescription Services or effectuate any other divesture. If we are unable to consummate the divestiture of vitaCare Prescription Services or do not realize the expected strategic, economic, or other benefits of that or any other divestiture transaction, it could adversely affect our business and financial position.\nWe currently derive all of our revenue from sales or licenses of our women\u2019s healthcare products, and our failure to maintain or increase sales of these products could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nIn 2020, we derived all of our revenue from sales or licenses of our women\u2019s healthcare products, including patient-controlled, long-acting contraceptive, hormone therapy pharmaceutical products, prenatal and women\u2019s multi-vitamins, and iron supplements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain such sales or that such sales will grow. In addition to other risks described herein, our ability to maintain or increase existing product sales is subject to several risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe presence of new or existing competing products, including non-authorized generic copies of our products;\n\u25cf\nsupply or distribution problems arising with any of our manufacturing and distribution partners;\n\u25cf\nchanged or increased regulatory restrictions or regulatory actions by the FDA;\n\u25cf\nchanges in healthcare laws and policy, including changes in requirements for drug pricing, rebates, reimbursement, and coverage by federal healthcare programs and commercial payers;\n\u25cf\nthe impact or efficacy of any price increases we may implement in the future;\n\u25cf\nchanges to our labels and labeling, including new safety warnings or changes to our boxed warnings, that further restrict how we market and sell our products; and\n\u25cf\nacceptance of our products as safe and effective by physicians and patients.\nIf revenue from sales of our products does not increase, we may be required to reduce our operating expenses or to seek to raise additional funds, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects, or we may not be able to commercialize all of our pharmaceutical products or commence or continue clinical trials to seek approval for any other products we may choose to develop in the future.\nThe commercial success of our existing products and other pharmaceutical products that we may develop, if approved in the future, will depend upon gaining and retaining significant market acceptance of these products among physicians and payers.\nPhysicians may not prescribe our products, which would prevent us from generating revenue or becoming profitable. Market acceptance of our products, including our hormone therapy pharmaceutical products and patient-controlled, long-acting contraceptive, by physicians, patients, and payers, will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe clinical indications for which our hormone therapy pharmaceutical products and patient-controlled, long-acting contraceptive are approved;\n\u25cf\nacceptance by physicians and payers of each product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including numerous generic pharmaceutical products;\n\u25cf\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration of our products in the treatment of the symptoms for which they are intended;\n\u25cf\nthe availability and efficacy of competitive drugs and devices;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our sales force and marketing efforts;\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which the product is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals and managed care organizations, including any access barriers such as prior authorizations and step-edits;\n\u25cf\nthe potential inclusion of a new category for one-year multi-cycle hormonal birth control methods in the FDA Birth Control Guide, which payers may rely upon as guidance for coverage;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other healthcare payers, or by government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling; and\n\u25cf\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects.\nEven if the medical community accepts that our products are safe and effective for their approved indications, physicians may not immediately be receptive to their use or may be slow to adopt our products as an accepted treatment for the symptoms for which they are intended. Labeling approved by the FDA may not permit us to promote our products as being superior to competing products, because the FDA applies a heightened level of scrutiny to comparative claims when applying its statutory standards for advertising and promotion, including with regard to its requirements for supporting data and that promotional labeling be truthful and not misleading, and there is potential for differing interpretations of whether certain communications are consistent with a product\u2019s FDA-required labeling. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians and payers, we may not generate sufficient or any revenue from these products and we may not become profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers on the benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nWe are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.\nThe products we are currently commercializing, including IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA and our prenatal vitamins, and the pharmaceutical products we are developing and planning to develop in the future, are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation, including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including its Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, to the extent our products are paid for directly or indirectly by those departments, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents. The FDA regulates dietary supplements, cosmetics, and drugs under different regulatory schemes. For example, the FDA regulates the processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and distribution of dietary supplements and cosmetics under its dietary supplement and cosmetic authority, respectively. The FDA also regulates the research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, and export of pharmaceutical products under various regulatory provisions. If any pharmaceutical products we develop are tested or marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not we have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses. Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding U.S. regulation.\nWe are also subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u25cf\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, prohibits, among other things, persons and entities, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of, or arrangement for the referral of, an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, or recommendation of, any good or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to, among other things, arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d includes kickbacks, bribes or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, waivers of payment, ownership interest and providing anything at less than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. The safe harbors are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, and we may decide to adjust our business practices or be subject to heightened scrutiny as a result. For example, under a final rule issued in 2020 and to take effect January 1, 2022, OIG revised the AKS\u2019s Discount Safe Harbor to explicitly exclude reductions in price offered by drug manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and Part D plans from the safe harbor\u2019s definition of a \u201cdiscount,\u201d meaning AKS immunity would not be available for such arrangements, and as a result potential AKS risks would increase unless arraignments were restructured. The failure to meet the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not meet the criteria for safe harbor protection from AKS liability in all cases. Liability under the AKS may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, federal law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA, described below. Violations of the AKS carry potentially significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, including imprisonment, fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. The compliance and enforcement landscape, and related risk, is informed by government precedent, Advisory Opinions, and Special Fraud Alerts. For example, on November 16, 2020 the OIG published a Special Fraud Alert addressing manufacturer speaker programs signaling that such programs will be subject to an even higher degree of government scrutiny for potential AKS compliance concerns. Our approach to compliance may evolve over time in light of these types of developments. For example, we are currently evaluating the impact of the November 16, 2020 Special Fraud Alert on our speaker programs; if we are required to materially change our speaker programs to comply with the Special Fraud Alert, our speaker programs may be less effective, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n\u25cf\nThe FCA prohibits entities and individuals from intentionally (or with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance) presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs, or improperly retaining known overpayments;\n\u25cb\nViolations of the FCA carry penalties of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. Suits filed under the federal FCA can be brought directly by the government or be brought by an individual (known as a \u201crelator\u201d or, more commonly, as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d) on behalf of the government, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions. Relators bringing qui tam actions under the FCA receive a share of any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of entities, including manufacturers, to have to defend a false claim action, even before the validity of the claim is established and even if the government decides not to intervene in the lawsuit. Companies may decide to agree to large settlements with the government and/or whistleblowers to avoid the cost and negative publicity associated with litigation. Criminal prosecution is possible for knowingly making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government. In addition to the FCA, many states have enacted their own false claims act statutes that address similar conduct and that may apply to claims for items or services submitted to any payor source, not just government-funded programs.\n\u25cb\nAlthough we do not submit claims directly to payers, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, marketing products of sub-standard quality, or, as noted above, paying a kickback that results in a claim for items or services. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under the FCA. For example, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.\n\u25cf\nThe Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or CMPL, imposes substantial civil monetary penalties against an entity that engages in prohibited activities, including but not limited to violations of the AKS, knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim, employment of an excluded individual and the provision or offer of anything of value to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the transferring party knows or should know is likely to influence beneficiary selection of a particular provider for which payment may be made in whole or in part by Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u25cb\n\u201cRemuneration\u201d is defined under the CMPL as any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value. There are certain exceptions to the definition of remuneration for offerings that meet the Financial Need, Preventative Care, or Promoting Access to Care exceptions. Sanctions for violations of the CMPL include civil monetary penalties and administrative penalties up to and including exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.\n\u25cf\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including third-party private payers, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by trick, scheme, or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. State laws may also govern the privacy and security of health information or other personal information in certain circumstances.\n\u25cf\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain covered entities and their business associates with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Our vitaCare Prescription Services subsidiary is a covered entity under HIPAA. HITECH also gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal court to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights, or the OCR, has increased its focus on compliance and continues to train state attorneys general for enforcement purposes. The OCR has recently increased both its efforts to audit HIPAA compliance and its level of enforcement, with one recent penalty exceeding $5 million.\n\u25cf\nAccording to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or deceptive practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC\u2019s guidance for appropriately securing consumers\u2019 personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.\n\u25cf\nFederal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs.\n\u25cf\nThe Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under certain government healthcare programs (with certain exceptions) to annually report to CMS information related to certain payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made or provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to other entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Numerous state laws may also require disclosure of transfers of value to healthcare providers, pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Transfers of value to certain other providers such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants will also need to be tracked and reported under the Sunshine Act beginning in 2022.\n\u25cf\nAnalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, and other state laws addressing the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, may apply to interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers, sales or marketing arrangements, and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by commercial third-party payers, including private healthcare insurers and health maintenance organizations, and in some cases that may apply regardless of payer, i.e., even if reimbursement is not available; further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance program guidelines (the PhRMA Code) and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government (HHS-OIG) in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report pricing and marketing information, including, among other things, information related to gifts, payments, or other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information and the use of prescriber-identifiable data in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, California enacted legislation - the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA - which went into effect January 1, 2020 and, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information, and creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. The CCPA was recently amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, expanding certain consumer rights such as the right to know. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to these laws by the California legislature or how these laws will be interpreted and enforced. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA are significant and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply.\nMany aspects of these laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations that increases the risk of potential violations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. Many state laws differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. Moreover, the number and complexity of both federal and state laws continues to increase, and additional governmental resources are being used to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. We anticipate that government scrutiny of pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices will continue for the foreseeable future and subject us to the risk of government investigations and enforcement actions. For example, federal enforcement agencies recently have shown interest in pharmaceutical companies\u2019 product and patient assistance programs, including manufacturer reimbursement support services and relationships with specialty pharmacies. Some of these investigations have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements.\nEfforts to ensure that our operations, including our business arrangements with third parties, comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. In connection with the commercial launches of IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA, we have grown our compliance program and are in the process of developing a program based on industry best practices and tailored to evolving risks as we launch additional products, identify new distribution channels and target new patient types. Although effective compliance programs can help mitigate the risk of investigation, regulatory and enforcement actions, and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state fraud, privacy, security, and reporting laws may prove costly. We cannot guarantee that a government agency will agree with our interpretations and it is possible that an enforcement authority may find that one or more of our business practices may not comply. If our past or present operations, including activities conducted by our sales team or agents, are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, and damage our reputation. In addition, even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, and could result in related stockholder suits, any of which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, from time to time in the future, we may become subject to additional laws or regulations issued by federal or state agencies. Federal and state elections in 2020 have changed which persons and parties occupy the presidency of the United States and control both chambers of Congress and many states\u2019 governors and legislatures. These changes will likely result in new agency priorities, rulemakings, and legislation. We anticipate that the new Biden administration will issue a number of Executive Orders, which may alter the policies of the previous administration. Additionally, certain agency rules and policy statements of the prior administration may be rescinded. Further, the Biden administration may propose substantial changes to the U.S. healthcare system, including expanding government-funded health insurance options. We are uncertain of the impact or outcome of these potential Executive Orders, rescission of rules and policy statements, or new legislation, especially any relative impact on the healthcare regulatory and policy landscape, or the impact they may have on our business. Such developments could, however, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, additional personnel, or other new requirements. Any such developments could have an adverse effect on our business.\nCoverage and reimbursement may not be available for our products, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably, or if available, government mandated rebates may be too high and may adversely affect our profitability.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our products, including IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA, and our prescription vitamins, will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by healthcare reform measures. Government healthcare programs and third-party payers decide which prescription pharmaceutical products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Payers generally do not cover OTC products, and coverage for prescription vitamins and dietary supplements varies. Many private third-party payers, such as managed care plans, manage access to pharmaceutical products\u2019 coverage partly to control costs to their plans, and may use drug formularies and medical policies to limit their exposure. Factors considered by these payers include product efficacy, cost effectiveness, and safety, as well as the availability of other treatments including generic prescription drugs. Our ability to commercialize IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA successfully depends on coverage and reimbursement levels set by government healthcare programs and third-party private payers. Obtaining and maintaining favorable reimbursement can be a time-consuming and expensive process, and we may not be able to negotiate or continue to negotiate reimbursement or pricing terms for our products with payers at levels that are profitable to us, or at all.\nIn both the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been several legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Payment or reimbursement of prescription drugs by Medicaid or Medicare requires manufacturers of the drugs to submit pricing information to CMS. The Medicaid Drug Rebate statute requires manufacturers to calculate and report price points, which are used to determine Medicaid rebate payments shared between the states and the federal government and Medicaid payment rates for the drug. For drugs paid under Medicare Part B, manufacturers must also calculate and report their Average Sales Price, or ASP, which is used to determine the Medicare Part B payment rate for the drug. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and requires rebates on outpatient drugs. Each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program, including supplemental rebate programs that prioritize coverage for drugs on the state Preferred Drug List. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. In addition, government programs like Medicaid include substantial penalties for increasing commercial prices over the rate of inflation which can affect realization and return on investment. The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest and states have begun to take action to increase transparency in drug pricing through mandatory reporting requirements. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, any such cost-reduction initiatives could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our products from Medicare, if any, including IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA, and could significantly harm our business. It was historically unclear whether products approved to treat moderate-to-severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause, such as IMVEXXY, were excluded under Medicare Part D, which resulted in limited Medicare coverage for such products. A clarification issued by CMS in May 2018 indicated that drugs, such as IMVEXXY, that are approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dyspareunia (as well as drugs approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause) are not excluded from Medicare Part D coverage. CMS\u2019s clarification, however, is no guarantee that such coverage will be obtained for IMVEXXY and obtaining Medicare or other government healthcare program reimbursement for any new pharmaceutical products may take up to several years following FDA approval.\nOur ability to commercialize ANNOVERA depends on coverage and reimbursement levels set by government healthcare programs and third-party private payers. The ACA mandates that private health plans provide coverage for women\u2019s preventative services, without imposing patient cost-sharing requirements, as recommended by HRSA. HRSA Guidelines require private health plans to cover, with no patient out-of-pocket costs, at least one form of treatment (e.g., one product) in each of the methods (e.g., classes of contraception) identified by the FDA for women in its Birth Control Guide. To the extent ANNOVERA is deemed a new class of contraception by the FDA, such a designation could allow for coverage by private health plans with no patient out-of-pocket costs. However, there is no guarantee that such coverage will be obtained, and it is possible that other FDA-approved products could also be included in this new class. For instance, the FDA may find that ANNOVERA fits into the vaginal contraceptive ring class, which it would share with NuvaRing and its generic equivalents, and potentially others. Pursuant to HRSA Guidelines, private payers need only provide no-cost coverage for one product in each class and may use reasonable medical management to determine whether and to what extent to cover other products in the class. Private payers may interpret the statute and its associated rules in ways in which they decline to cover ANNOVERA, even if we believe ANNOVERA should be covered without cost sharing under the ACA framework. To the extent ANNOVERA is not the only FDA-approved product in a designated class of contraception, private payers may choose not to cover our one-year vaginal contraceptive system or may require patient cost-sharing obligations. Some states have amended and expanded requirements to match the standard set in the ACA mandate, specifically requiring coverage for the full range of contraceptive methods, counseling and services used by women and eliminating out-of-pocket costs and limiting other health plan restrictions. The prior administration implemented policies that permit certain employers to claim a religious or moral objection to the birth control coverage mandate under the ACA. On July 8, 2020, the Supreme Court held in Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, et. al. that health plans sponsored by certain exempt religious employers and non-profit religious organizations that certify they have religious objections do not need to offer contraception coverage through their health benefit plans. This exemption could be overturned by the new Biden administration through an Executive Order or other policy or regulatory action. Further, despite our progress with commercial payers, there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain our agreements or obtain new agreements or that we will be able to negotiate favorable reimbursement or pricing terms for our products in the future. In addition, healthcare reform, including potential repeal of or changes to the ACA, continues to attract significant legislative and administrative interest, legal challenges, regulatory and compliance requirements, new approaches and public attention that create uncertainty and the potential for additional changes. Healthcare reform implementation, additional legislation or regulations, and other changes in government policy or regulation may repeal the contraception coverage mandate, affect our reimbursement or impose additional coverage limitations and/or cost-sharing obligations on patients, any of which could have an adverse effect on coverage and reimbursement of our products, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be harmed.\nTo the extent we obtain coverage for our products by state Medicaid programs, we may be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for any covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program, and to comply with all Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Healthcare Act of 1992. Moreover, federal law requires that any company participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B Program, which impose additional reporting requirements and price concessions. Manufacturer compliance with 340B Program requirements can be costly. In addition, if our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration or to low income patients of certain hospitals, additional laws and requirements may apply.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products generally due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, the ongoing debates on reducing government spending and additional legislative proposals. We cannot predict whether new proposals will be made or adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us if they are adopted.\nThe availability of generic products at lower prices than branded products may substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for branded products, such as IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA.\nIf we fail to successfully secure and maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we could have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be harmed.\nFuture legislation or regulations may adversely affect reimbursement from government healthcare programs and third-party payers.\nThere have been efforts by government officials and legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. On May 11, 2018, the prior administration issued its \u201cBlueprint\u201d to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs, as well as additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, and incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products. Following on this initiative, HHS announced a drug payment model through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to lower Medicare Part B payments for certain drugs to the lowest price for similar countries. Beginning January 1, 2021, the model, known as the Most Favored Nation (MFN) Model, will test a new model of drug payments whereby Medicare will pay no more for high cost, physician-administered Medicare Part B drugs than the lowest price charged in other similar countries.\nWhile drug pricing was a priority for the prior administration, we expect that it will continue to be a focus of the Biden administration in 2021 and beyond. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nWe are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation in the United States directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. The ACA and any further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenue or increase our costs could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, if a federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period, federal government payment obligations, including its obligations under Medicaid and Medicare, may be delayed. Similarly, if state government shutdowns were to occur, state payment obligations may be delayed. If the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis, our ability to sell our products to government payers may be limited and/or our ability to establish acceptable pricing levels may be impaired, thereby reducing anticipated revenues and profitability.\nOur dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of our existing women\u2019s healthcare products and our pharmaceutical product candidates may cause delays in, or prevent us from, successfully developing, commercializing, and marketing our products.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we currently plan to build or acquire, the infrastructure or capability to internally manufacture our existing women\u2019s healthcare products, IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA, or our pharmaceutical product candidates. We have relied, and will continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture these products in accordance with our specifications and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. We have entered into long-term supply agreements with Catalent for the commercial supply of IMVEXXY and BIJUVA. Under the terms of the agreements, we are obligated to purchase certain minimum annual amounts of each product. We have also entered into a long-term supply contract with QPharma AB for ANNOVERA. Under the terms of the QPharma agreement, we are obligated to purchase certain minimum annual amounts of ANNOVERA. We depend on Lang, a full-service, private label and corporate brand manufacturer, to supply our vitaMedMD and BocaGreen products. We do not have long-term contracts for the commercial supply of our vitaMedMD and BocaGreen products, however, in certain circumstances, including our failure to satisfy our production forecasts to Lang, we may be obligated to reimburse Lang for the costs of excess raw materials purchased by Lang that it cannot use in another product category that it then sells.\nRegulatory requirements could pose barriers to the manufacture of our women\u2019s healthcare products and our pharmaceutical product candidates. Holders of NDAs, or other forms of FDA approvals or clearances, or those distributing a regulated product under their own name, are ultimately responsible for compliance with manufacturing obligations even if the manufacturing is conducted by a third-party contract manufacturing organization, or CMO. All of our existing products are manufactured by CMOs. These CMOs are required by the terms of our contracts to manufacture our products in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements. The CMO that manufactures IMVEXXY and BIJUVA has previously been inspected by the FDA and received Form 483 observations with respect to its softgel manufacturing plant that is used for the manufacture of the commercial supply of IMVEXXY and BIJUVA. The CMO that manufactures ANNOVERA has previously been inspected by the FDA and received Form 483 observations with respect to its facility that is used for the commercial supply of ANNOVERA. We believe that corrective actions to address the compliance issues identified in the referenced Forms 483 have been implemented by the CMOs; however, the FDA has not yet reinspected the CMOs to confirm that the corrective actions were implemented as described to the agency in the respective Form 483 responses.\nIf our manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA and any applicable foreign regulatory authority, our regulatory submissions may be delayed or disapproved, and our marketed products may be affected. If these facilities are not in compliance for the manufacture of our products, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would result in substantial disruptions of our sales of existing products and significant delays of up to several years in obtaining approval for our pharmaceutical product candidates. In addition, our manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. After generally suspending in-person inspections due to COVID-19, the FDA announced it would resume domestic facility inspections, although the agency continues its general suspension of foreign facility inspections (although \u201cmission-critical\u201d inspections may be considered on a case-by-case basis). Because of the global pandemic, decision-making around facility inspections by the FDA (including preapproval inspections) continues to evolve. Failure by any of our manufacturers to comply with applicable cGMP regulations or other applicable requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, violation letters, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions, interruptions in supply, recalls, withdrawals, issuance of safety alerts, and criminal prosecutions, any of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We do not currently have alternative manufacturers, and we may not be able to enter into a long-term agreement with alternative manufacturers, or do so on commercially reasonable terms, and if we do enter into agreements with alternative manufacturers, those alternative manufacturers may not be approved by the FDA, any of which could have an adverse impact on our business. We also could experience manufacturing delays if our CMOs give greater priority to the supply of other products over our products and proposed products to the delay or other detriment of our products and proposed products, or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of their agreements with us. Finally, we could experience manufacturing delays or interruptions as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe also do not have long-term contracts for the supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, used in IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA. If any supplier of the API or other products used in our products or pharmaceutical product candidates experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes, does not comply with the terms of an agreement between us, or does not devote sufficient time, energy, and care to providing our manufacturing needs, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of our products or pharmaceutical product candidates, which could impair our ability to supply our products or pharmaceutical product candidates at the levels required for commercialization and prevent or delay their successful commercialization.\nEven after the approval of IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA, and even if we obtain regulatory approval for other pharmaceutical product candidates, we will still face extensive, ongoing regulatory requirements and review, and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nWith respect to IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or to the conditions for approval or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials or post-market surveillance. As a condition to granting marketing approval of a product, the FDA may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials. The results generated in these post-approval clinical trials could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, or new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy of a product. For example, the labeling for IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA contains restrictions on use and warnings. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, gives the FDA enhanced post-market authority, including the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with FDA-approved REMS programs. IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance and reporting, advertising, promotion, record keeping, and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The FDA\u2019s exercise of its authority could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements, and potential restrictions on sales of approved products. As part of the FDA\u2019s approval of IMVEXXY, we have committed to conduct a post-approval observational study to evaluate the risk of endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women with a uterus who use a low-dose vaginal estrogen unopposed by a progestogen such as IMVEXXY. As part of the FDA\u2019s approval of ANNOVERA, the FDA has required a post-approval observational study be performed to measure the risk of venous thromboembolism. Foreign regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirement. Post-marketing studies, whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and other emerging data about marketed products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect sales of our pharmaceutical product candidates once approved, and potentially our other marketed products. Further, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of our approved products. Accordingly, new data about our products could negatively affect demand because of real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal or recall. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, and practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of our products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of our products.\nThe holder of an approved NDA also is subject to obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. Legal requirements have also been enacted to require disclosure of certain clinical trial results on a publicly available database.\nIn addition, manufacturers of pharmaceutical products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements, such as adverse event reporting. If we or a regulatory agency discovers problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility, or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing, requiring new warnings or other labeling changes to limit use of the drug, requiring that we conduct additional clinical trials, imposing new monitoring requirements, or requiring that we establish a REMS program. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws, and are subject to review by FDA. If the FDA raises concerns regarding our promotional materials or messages, we may be required to modify or discontinue using them and may be required to provide corrective information. Should we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to significant liability including civil and administrative actions as well as criminal sanctions.\nCommercial products must now meet the requirements of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which imposes obligations on manufacturers of prescription pharmaceutical products for commercial distribution, regulating the distribution of the products at the federal level, and sets certain standards for federal or state registration and compliance of entities in the supply chain (manufacturers and re-packagers, wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers, and dispensers). The DSCSA preempts previously enacted state pedigree laws and the pedigree requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations. Trading partners within the drug supply chain must now ensure certain product tracing requirements are met that they are doing business with other authorized trading partners; and they are required to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statements. Product identifier information (an aspect of the product tracing scheme) is also now required. The DSCSA requirements, development of standards, and the system for product tracing have been and will continue to be phased in over a period of years, with FDA indicating enforcement discretion on certain aspects due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of product samples continues to be regulated under the PDMA, and some states also impose regulations on drug sample distribution.\nOur activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. If we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may take any of the following actions:\n\u25cf\nconduct an investigation into our practices and any alleged violation of law;\n\u25cf\nissue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u25cf\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u25cf\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u25cf\nrequire that we suspend or terminate any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u25cf\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u25cf\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall; or\n\u25cf\nexclude us from providing our products to those participating in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nRecent government enforcement has targeted pharmaceutical companies for violations of fraud, abuse and other laws.\nThe AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, pharmacies, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical products, including certain discounts, or engagement of speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Our practices with respect to interactions with healthcare professionals, including but not limited to consultant relationships, speaker programs, advisory boards, and scientific/educational grant programs, as well as our arrangements with pharmacies, may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from AKS liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as certain educational and research grants or patient assistance programs. The safe harbors are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, and we may decide to adjust our business practices or be subject to heightened scrutiny as a result.\nIn addition, several states have recently enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing and promotional compliance programs or codes of conduct and/or to file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities. Several states have also adopted laws that prohibit or limit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers.\nThe FDA also strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity, and potency that are approved by the FDA. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for unapproved indications that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Pharmaceutical companies, however, are required to promote their pharmaceutical products only for the approved indications and consistent with the FDA-required, approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, but not limited to, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and the FCA, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, debarment, and refusal of government contracts.\nWe cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will be sufficient to protect against acts of our employees, business partners or vendors that may violate federal or state fraud and abuse laws or other applicable requirements.\nFederal enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have shown and continue to show interest in pharmaceutical companies\u2019 product and patient assistance programs (PAPs), including reimbursement support, co-pay support, nursing, adherence and educational services, referrals to other providers, donations to independent patient assistance charities, and relationships with specialty pharmacies. Co-pay assistance programs are intended to assist qualified patients with private insurance with any out-of-pocket financial obligations but must exclude any government healthcare program beneficiaries. Several investigations into patient assistance practices have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. We offer co-pay assistance for our vitamin products and IMVEXXY and BIJUVA, including co-pay assistance and free drug sample packs for IMVEXXY and BIJUVA, and potentially will enter into similar programs for ANNOVERA. While the OIG has approved certain independent charitable PAPs that help financially needy beneficiaries, advisory opinions on this issue have primarily focused on charities that provide assistance to patients who cannot afford cost-sharing obligations for prescription drugs. A key element for the OIG has been whether the charities are sufficiently independent from drug manufacturer donors. In May 2014, the OIG issued a Supplemental Special Advisory Bulletin regarding Independent Charity Patient Assistance Programs, or the 2014 Special Advisory Bulletin, which updated its 2005 Special Advisory Bulletin relating to PAPs. In the 2014 Special Advisory Bulletin, the OIG stated that although PAPs provide important safety net assistance to financially needy patients, these programs also present a risk of fraud, waste, and abuse with respect to federal health care programs. One of the three factors set forth in the revised guidance was that the PAP could not limit assistance to a single product. In September of 2014, the OIG also released a Special Advisory Bulletin on pharmaceutical manufacturer copayment coupons, specifically stating that manufacturers that did not comply with the law may be subject to sanctions if they fail to take appropriate steps to ensure that such coupons do not induce the purchase of Federal health care program items or services, including, but not limited to, drugs paid for by Medicare Part D. Failure to take such steps may be evidence of intent to induce the purchase of drugs paid for by these programs, in violations of the AKS. PAPs have also been the subject of Congressional review. If we fail to structure our patient assistance and support programs to comply with applicable law, we risk becoming subject to government investigations, and potentially, facing penalties or consequences for violations under fraud and abuse laws. Although we believe that our business practices are structured to be compliant with applicable laws, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our past or present operations, including activities conducted by our sales team or agents, are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, and damage our reputation. In addition, even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, to the extent we, our subsidiary, VitaCare Prescription Services, or our other contractors or agents receive or obtain individually identifiable health information from patients, healthcare professionals, pharmacies, or other individuals or entities, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we mishandle individually identifiable health information in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. In addition, VitaCare Prescription Services\u2019 activities could be subject to regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which VitaCare conducts its business, including state licensing of pharmacies and pharmacists and as a result of potential increased scrutiny of innovation in hub services.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing events or penalties may force us to expend significant amounts of time and money and may significantly inhibit our ability to bring to market or continue to market our products and generate revenue. Similar regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions.\nSome of our products can be prescribed to patients via a virtual health platform, such as PlushCare, a direct-to-consumer telehealth platform offering primary care medical services, subject to state telehealth and prescribing laws. The federal Ryan Haight Act substantially limits the ability of prescribers to prescribe controlled substances via telehealth. While this federal law applies only to federally controlled substances, the permissibility of prescribing other non-controlled substances via a telehealth encounter is addressed at the state level. Constant changes to the telehealth laws and regulations as well as state pharmacy and prescribing laws and emerging enforcement priorities by state legislatures, licensing bodies, and attorney generals\u2019 offices, make it difficult to predict our ability to effectively provide patient access to our products via virtual care offerings. There have been recent waivers of telehealth restrictions, including many of those pertaining to electronic prescribing based on a telehealth encounter, in order to assist in expanding access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these waivers are tied to the federal public health emergency declaration but some state laws have different expiration dates. We cannot guarantee that prescribers will be able, or willing, to prescribe our products to patients via a telehealth encounter and any limitations on such remote prescribing at the state level may impede our ability to expand access to our products.\nLicensing of intellectual property involves complex legal, business and scientific issues, and disputes could jeopardize our rights under such agreements. Additionally, our current licensing agreements contain limitations and restrictions that could limit or adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize other products in the future.\nWe are currently and may in the future be a party to license agreements of importance to our business and to our products and product candidates. Disputes may arise between us and any of these counterparties regarding intellectual property subject to and each parties\u2019 obligations under such agreements, including:\n\u25cf\nour diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product and product candidates, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u25cf\nthe scope of rights granted under the agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u25cf\nour obligations to make milestone, royalty, or other payments under those agreements;\n\u25cf\nwhether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the agreement;\n\u25cf\nour right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties:\n\u25cf\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how arising under the agreement or resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners;\n\u25cf\nour right to transfer or assign the license; and\n\u25cf\nthe effects of termination.\nThese or other disputes over our obligations or intellectual property that we have licensed may prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current arrangements on acceptable terms, or may impair the value of the arrangement to us. Any such dispute could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under a license agreement in a material respect, the respective licensor could have the right to terminate the respective agreement and upon the effective date of such termination, have the right to re-obtain the related technology as well as, potentially, aspects of any intellectual property controlled by us and developed during the period the agreement was in force that relate to the applicable technology. This means that the licensor to each of these agreements could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of the applicable product or product candidate after an uncured, material breach of the agreement by us. This may also be the case if we voluntarily terminate the relevant agreement. Any uncured, material breach under a license agreement could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for the applicable product or product candidates.\nIn July 2018, we entered into a license agreement with the Population Council to obtain exclusive U.S. rights to commercialize ANNOVERA. The agreement requires us to commercialize this product and enter into certain manufacturing agreements, make timely milestone and other payments, provide certain information regarding our activities under the agreement, and indemnify the other party with respect to our development and commercialization activities under the terms of the agreements.\nIn addition, our current licensing agreement with the Population Council contains limitations and restrictions, including limitations that could limit or adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize this or other product candidates including the following:\n\u25cf\nwe cannot sublicense the rights licensed to us without the consent of the Population Council;\n\u25cf\nneither we nor the Population Council may develop a competitive product (as defined with respect to each party in the agreement) for six years from the date of the agreement; and\n\u25cf\nthe Population Council owns any program improvements, as defined in the agreement.\nWe have also entered into licensing and supply agreements with Knight pursuant to which we granted Knight an exclusive license to commercialize IMVEXXY and BIJUVA in Canada and Israel and with Theramex pursuant to which we granted Theramex an exclusive license to commercialize BIJUVA, and IMVEXXY outside of the U.S., except for Canada and Israel.\nSales of our products in the U.S. and our rights to receive royalties with respect to our products sold outside the U.S. could be adversely affected if products manufactured outside of the U.S. or for sale outside of the U.S. under the terms of these licensing and supply agreements are reimported and sold in the U.S. In addition, our rights to receive royalties with respect to our products sold outside the U.S. could be adversely affected if our licensees fail to diligently pursue approval of our products, or opt not to sell our products, in certain jurisdictions where they are not required to do so.\nIf our dietary supplement, hormone therapy pharmaceutical products or patient-controlled, long-acting contraceptive products do not have the effects intended or cause undesirable side effects, our business may suffer.\nAlthough many of the ingredients in our dietary supplement products are vitamins, minerals, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption, they also contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. Furthermore, our hormone therapy or patient-controlled, long-acting contraceptive pharmaceutical products have been approved by the FDA based on its assessment of the safety and efficacy of these products. While we believe that all of these products and the combinations of ingredients in them are safe when taken as directed, the products could have certain undesirable side effects if not taken as directed or if taken by a consumer who has certain medical conditions. In addition, these products may not have the effect intended if they are not taken in accordance with certain instructions, which include certain dietary or other labeling restrictions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any of the products, even when used as directed, will have the effects intended or will not have harmful side effects in an unforeseen way or on an unforeseen cohort. If any of our products or products we develop or commercialize in the future are shown to be harmful or generate negative publicity from perceived harmful effects, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be harmed significantly.\nOur products face significant competition from branded and generic products, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nDevelopment and awareness of our brand will depend largely upon our success in increasing our consumer base and maintaining adequate pricing through our exclusivities. The pharmaceutical and dietary supplement industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our products face intense competition, including from major multinational pharmaceutical and dietary supplement companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical, and generic drug companies. Many of these companies have greater financial and other resources, such as larger research and development staffs and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. They also may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the products that we sell or develop obsolete. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. If we are unable to economically promote or maintain our brand, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be severely harmed. In addition, our efforts to provide an alternative to the non-FDA-approved compound bioidentical market for estradiol and progesterone products sold by compounding pharmacies may not be successful. Finally, loss of exclusivity may provide opportunity for competing products, particularly generics, to erode pricing and siphon off our consumers.\nOn February 20, 2020, we received the IMVEXXY Notice Letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Teva. The ANDA seeks approval from the FDA to commercially manufacture, use, or sell a generic version of the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses of IMVEXXY. In the IMVEXXY Notice Letter, Teva alleges that IMVEXXY Patents listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book that claim compositions and methods of IMVEXXY are invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by Teva\u2019s commercial manufacture, use, or sale of its proposed generic drug product. The IMVEXXY Patents identified in the IMVEXXY Notice Letter expire in 2032 or 2033. On April 1, 2020, we filed a complaint for patent infringement against Teva in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey arising from Teva\u2019s ANDA filing with the FDA. We are seeking, among other relief, an order that the effective date of any FDA approval of Teva\u2019s ANDA would be a date no earlier than the expiration of the IMVEXXY Patents and equitable relief enjoining Teva from infringing the IMVEXXY Patents. Teva has filed its answer and counterclaim to the complaint, alleging that the IMVEXXY Patents are invalid and not infringed. A trial date has not been set. The complaint which we filed automatically precludes the FDA from approving Teva\u2019s ANDA until the earlier of 30 months or entry of a district court decision finding the IMVEXXY Patents invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. We cannot assure you that the complaint filed on April 1, 2020 or any other patent infringement lawsuit that we may file will prevent the introduction of a generic version of IMVEXXY for any particular length of time, or at all. If Teva\u2019s ANDA is approved, and a generic version of IMVEXXY is introduced, our sales of IMVEXXY could be adversely affected.\nOn March 17, 2020, we received the BIJUVA Notice Letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Amneal. The ANDA seeks approval from the FDA to commercially manufacture, use, or sell a generic version of BIJUVA. In the BIJUVA Notice Letter, Amneal alleges that the BIJUVA Patents are invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by Amneal\u2019s commercial manufacture, use, or sale of its proposed generic drug product. The BIJUVA Patents identified in the BIJUVA Notice Letter expire in 2032. On April 29, 2020, we filed a complaint for patent infringement against Amneal in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey arising from Amneal\u2019s ANDA filing with the FDA. We are seeking, among other relief, an order that the effective date of any FDA approval of Amneal\u2019s ANDA would be a date no earlier than the expiration of the BIJUVA Patents and equitable relief enjoining Amneal from infringing the BIJUVA Patents. Amneal has filed its answer and counterclaim to the complaint, alleging that the BIJUVA Patents are invalid and not infringed. A trial date has not been set. The complaint which we filed automatically precludes the FDA from approving Amneal\u2019s ANDA until the earlier of 30 months or entry of a district court decision finding the BIJUVA Patents invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. On February 25, 2021, the District Court entered an order temporarily staying all proceedings in the BIJUVA litigation. The District Court stay also extends the 30-month stay for the period in which the BIJUVA litigation has been stayed. We cannot assure you that the complaint filed on April 29, 2020 or any other patent infringement lawsuit that we may file will prevent the introduction of a generic version of BIJUVA for any particular length of time, or at all. If Amneal\u2019s ANDA is approved, and a generic version of BIJUVA is introduced, our sales of BIJUVA could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we cannot predict what additional ANDAs could be filed by Teva, Amneal or other potential generic competitors requesting approval to market generic forms of our products, which could require us to incur significant additional expense and result in distraction for our management team, and if approved, result in significant decreases in the revenue derived from sales of our marketed products and thereby harm our business and financial condition.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval outside the U.S. will prevent our licensees from marketing our hormone therapy pharmaceutical products in non-U.S. markets.\nWe have entered into licensing and supply agreements with Knight and Theramex to commercialize IMVEXXY and BIJUVA in non-U.S. markets. To market these products in the European Union and many other non-U.S. jurisdictions, our licensees must obtain separate regulatory approvals. We have had limited interactions with non-U.S. regulatory authorities, the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval or clearance. Approval or clearance by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more non-U.S. regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by other regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. The non-U.S. regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval or clearance. For these non-U.S. regulatory approvals, our licensees may not obtain them on a timely basis, if at all. Our licensees\u2019 failure to receive necessary non-U.S. regulatory approvals to commercialize IMVEXXY and BIJUVA in a given market could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, by seeking to obtain approval to market IMVEXXY and BIJUVA in one or more non-U.S. markets, we and/or our licensees will be subject to rules and regulations in those markets relating to our products. In some countries, particularly countries of the European Union, each of which has developed its own rules and regulations, pricing is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of regulatory approval for a drug. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, our licensees may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our pharmaceutical product to other available products. If reimbursement of our pharmaceutical product is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our licensees may be unable to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability with respect to any given market, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. If our licensees obtain approval to market IMVEXXY or BIJUVA in one or more non-U.S. markets, we will have additional pharmacovigilance reporting requirements for our products. To the extent that the non-U.S. markets in which our licensees distribute our products have different pharmacovigilance reporting requirements than the U.S., there is a risk that the marketing of our drugs in those countries may increase the number of adverse events reported for our products.\nOur success is tied to our distribution channels.\nWe sell our products to wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy distributors. During 2020, three customers each generated more than 10% of our total revenues; revenue generated from these three customers combined accounted for approximately 63% of our total revenue during 2020. Our business would be harmed if any of these customers refused to distribute our products or refused to purchase our products on commercially favorable terms to us.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our research and development activities, including our clinical trials, and we may experience delays in obtaining or may be unsuccessful in obtaining regulatory approval for, or in commercializing, our pharmaceutical product candidates if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines.\nWe do not have the resources to independently conduct research and development activities. Therefore, we have relied, and plan to continue to rely, on various third-party CROs to conduct our research and development activities and to recruit patients and monitor and manage data for our on-going clinical programs for our pharmaceutical product candidates, as well as for the execution of clinical studies. Although we only have oversight of certain aspects of our CROs\u2019 activities, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards. Our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities as sponsor. We cannot assure you that the CROs will conduct the research properly or in a timely manner, or that the results will be reproducible. We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Clinical Practice, or cGCP, regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our products in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic and pre-approval inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, CROs, and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable or invalid, and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our proposed products. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cGCPs. In addition, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness compared to placebo of our pharmaceutical product candidates to a statistically significant degree, our clinical trials will require an adequately large number of test subjects. Any clinical trial that a CRO conducts abroad on our behalf is subject to similar regulation. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or recruit enough patients, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIn addition, we do not employ the personnel of our CROs, and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such organizations, we cannot control whether or not they will devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical and pre-clinical programs. Our CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including one or more of our competitors, for which they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could impede their ability to devote appropriate time to our clinical programs. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised because of the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our pharmaceutical product candidates that we seek to develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our pharmaceutical product candidates that we seek to develop could be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed or end.\nWe typically engage one or more CROs on a project-by-project basis for each study or trial. While we have developed and plan to maintain our relationships with CROs that we have previously engaged, we also expect to enter into agreements with other CROs to obtain additional resources and expertise to accelerate our progress with regard to on-going clinical programs and, specifically, the compilation of clinical trial data for submission with an NDA for each of our pharmaceutical product candidates. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or entering into new relationships with CROs involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can affect our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines and can increase our costs significantly. Although we try to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $761.7 million. Subject to applicable limitations, these NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income, to the extent we generate any taxable income, and thereby reduce our future federal income taxes otherwise payable.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes limitations on a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an ownership change as defined in Section 382. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percent over a three-year period. If an ownership change has occurred, or were to occur, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years. We may be found to have experienced an ownership change under Section 382 because of events in the past or the issuance of shares of our common stock in the future. If so, the use of our NOLs, or a portion thereof, against our future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. federal tax code, including, but not limited to reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 21 percent and imposing new restrictions on the use of NOLs. The Tax Act reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Management assessed the valuation allowance analyses with respect to our NOLs as affected by various aspects of the Tax Act and determined that a full valuation allowance continues to be appropriate. Additionally, in order to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was enacted into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act includes several significant business tax provisions that, among other things, includes further statutory amendments to the rules governing NOLs, as amended by The Tax Act. The CARES Act limits the NOL carryover deduction in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, to the lesser of the NOL carryforward or 80 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income (after considering the deduction for NOLs arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018), which may restrict our ability to offset future taxable income with NOLs and increase our future federal income taxes otherwise payable.\nOur operations are concentrated in Boca Raton, Florida and interruptions affecting us or our suppliers due to natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, or other unforeseen events could adversely affect our operations.\nOur current operations are concentrated in Boca Raton, Florida. A hurricane, the COVID-19 pandemic, or other disaster or unforeseen event resulting in significant damage to our facilities, or causing illness in the personnel operating our facilities, could significantly disrupt or curtail or require us to cease our operations. It would be difficult, costly and time-consuming to transfer resources from one facility to another or to repair or replace our facility if it is significantly damaged, or engage or hire new personnel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our insurance may be insufficient to cover all of our losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if one of our suppliers, such as Catalent at its manufacturing facility in St. Petersburg, Florida, experiences a similar disaster or is otherwise impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or unforeseen event, we could face significant delays in obtaining our products. Any significant uninsured loss, prolonged or repeated disruption to operations or inability to operate, experienced by us or by our suppliers, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to adequately maintain a sales force will impede our growth.\nWe are substantially dependent on a sales force - both those directly employed by us and those engaged through our contract sales organization - to attract new business and to manage existing customer relationships. There is significant competition for qualified, productive direct sales personnel with advanced sales skills and technical knowledge. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining direct sales personnel. New and future sales personnel may not become as productive as expected, and we may be unable to hire or engage enough qualified individuals in the future in the markets in which we do business. If we are unable to hire, engage and develop enough productive sales personnel or are required to hire or engage more sales personnel than we expect our business prospects could suffer. In addition to utilizing a contract sales organization for part of our sales force, we also utilize this organization for certain sales support functions, such as fleet and sample management. We currently intend to insource at least some of these functions and personnel in the future. If we are unsuccessful in insourcing these functions or personnel, we may face delays or additional costs in commercializing our pharmaceutical products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther pharmaceutical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel may have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles, and longer histories than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, our ability to commercialize IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA may be limited.\nWe will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 400 employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial, sales and marketing, and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate, and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from their day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional pharmaceutical product candidates. If we are unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to increase revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our pharmaceutical products and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth in our organization.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property covering our hormone therapy pharmaceutical products and other products are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent positions as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our hormone therapy pharmaceutical products and other products. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain. The legal principles applicable to patents are in transition due to changing court precedent and legislative action, and we cannot be certain that the historical legal standards surrounding questions of validity will continue to be applied or that current defenses relating to issued patents in these fields will be sufficient in the future. Changes in patent laws in the U.S., such as the America Invents Act of 2011, may affect the scope, strength, and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings that may be brought by us related to our patent rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nThese risks include the possibility of the following:\n\u25cf\nthe patent applications that we have filed may fail to result in issued patents in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u25cf\npatents issued or licensed to us or our partners may be challenged or discovered to have been issued on the basis of insufficient, incomplete, or incorrect information, and thus held to be invalid or unenforceable;\n\u25cf\nthe scope of any patent protection may be too narrow to exclude competitors from developing or designing around these patents;\n\u25cf\nwe or our licensors were not the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u25cf\nwe or our licensors may not have been the first inventors to invent or file patent applications for these technologies in the U.S. or were not the first to file patent applications directed to these technologies abroad;\n\u25cf\nwe may fail to comply with procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process, which can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights;\n\u25cf\nfuture pharmaceutical product candidates may not be patentable;\n\u25cf\nothers may claim rights or ownership regarding patents and other proprietary rights that we hold or license;\n\u25cf\ndelays in development, testing, clinical trials, and regulatory review may reduce the period during which we could market our pharmaceutical products under patent protection; and\n\u25cf\nwe may fail to timely apply for patents on our technologies or products.\nWhile we apply for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate, many third parties may already have filed patent applications or have received patents in our areas of product development. These entities\u2019 applications, patents, and other intellectual property rights may conflict with patent applications to which we have rights and could prevent us from obtaining patents or could call into question the validity of any of our patents, if issued, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture, or commercialize our pharmaceutical products. In addition, if third parties file patent applications in the technologies that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference, derivation, or other proceedings with the USPTO or foreign patent regulatory authorities to determine our rights in the technologies, which may be time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, issued patents may be challenged in the courts or in post-grant proceedings at the USPTO, or in similar proceedings in foreign countries. These proceedings may result in loss of patent claims or adverse changes to the scope of the claims.\nIf we, our licensors, or our strategic partners fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, or our proprietary technologies and their uses, companies may be dissuaded from collaborating with us. In such event, our ability to commercialize our pharmaceutical products may be threatened, we could lose our competitive advantage, and the competition we face could increase, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, mechanisms exist in much of the world permitting some form of challenge by generic drug marketers to our patents before, or immediately following, the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies, such as \u201cat risk\u201d launches to challenge relevant patent rights. On February 20, 2020, we received the IMVEXXY Notice Letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Teva, and on March 17, 2020 we received the BIJUVA Notice Letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Amneal. The ANDA submitted by Teva seeks approval from the FDA to commercially manufacture, use, or sell a generic version of the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses of IMVEXXY, and the ANDA submitted by Amneal seeks approval from the FDA to commercially manufacture, use, or sell a generic version of BIJUVA.\nIn the IMVEXXY Notice Letter, Teva alleges that IMVEXXY Patents listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book that claim compositions and methods of IMVEXXY are invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by Teva\u2019s commercial manufacture, use, or sale of its proposed generic drug product. The IMVEXXY Patents identified in the IMVEXXY Notice Letter expire in 2032 or 2033. On April 1, 2020, we filed a complaint for patent infringement against Teva in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey arising from Teva\u2019s ANDA filing with the FDA. We are seeking, among other relief, an order that the effective date of any FDA approval of Teva\u2019s ANDA would be a date no earlier than the expiration of the IMVEXXY Patents and equitable relief enjoining Teva from infringing the IMVEXXY Patents. Teva has filed its answer and counterclaim to the complaint, alleging that the IMVEXXY Patents are invalid and not infringed. A trial date has not been set. The complaint which we filed automatically precludes the FDA from approving Teva\u2019s ANDA until the earlier of 30 months or entry of a district court decision finding the IMVEXXY Patents invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed.\nIn the BIJUVA Notice Letter, Amneal alleges that BIJUVA Patents listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book that claim compositions and methods of BIJUVA are invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by Amneal\u2019s commercial manufacture, use, or sale of its proposed generic drug product. The BIJUVA Patents identified in the BIJUVA Notice Letter expire in 2032. On April 29, 2020, we filed a complaint for patent infringement against Amneal in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey arising from Amneal\u2019s ANDA filing with the FDA. We are seeking, among other relief, an order that the effective date of any FDA approval of Amneal\u2019s ANDA would be a date no earlier than the expiration of the BIJUVA Patents and equitable relief enjoining Amneal from infringing the BIJUVA Patents. Amneal has filed its answer and counterclaim to the complaint, alleging that the BIJUVA Patents are invalid and not infringed. A trial date has not been set. The complaint which we filed automatically precludes the FDA from approving Amneal\u2019s ANDA until the earlier of 30 months or entry of a district court decision finding the BIJUVA Patents invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. On February 25, 2021, the District Court entered an order temporarily staying all proceedings in the BIJUVA litigation. The District Court stay also extends the 30-month stay for the period in which the BIJUVA litigation has been stayed.\nWe cannot assure you that any patent infringement lawsuit that we may file will prevent the introduction of a generic version of IMVEXXY or BIJUVA for any particular length of time, or at all. If Teva\u2019s ANDA or Amneal\u2019s ANDA are approved, and a generic version of IMVEXXY or BIJUVA is introduced, our sales of IMVEXXY or BIJUVA could be adversely affected. In addition, we cannot predict what additional ANDAs could be filed by Teva, Amneal or other potential generic competitors requesting approval to market generic forms of our products, which could require us to incur significant additional expense and result in distraction for our management team, and if approved, result in significant decreases in the revenue derived from sales of our marketed products and thereby harm our business and financial condition.\nOur business also may rely on unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, and trade secrets. If the confidentiality of this intellectual property is breached, it could adversely impact our business.\nWe may be required to file lawsuits or take other actions to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time-consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, including with respect to Teva\u2019s ANDA and BIJUVA Notice Letter, and Amneal\u2019s ANDA and IMVEXXY Notice Letter, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents, or those of our licensors, do not cover the technology in question or on other grounds. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents, or those of our licensors, at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications, or those of our licensors, at risk of not issuing. Moreover, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries in which the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S. or in those countries in which we do not file national phase patent applications. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, if securities analysts or investors perceive public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected. The occurrence of any of the above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our common stock, and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 25% of our common stock, inclusive of vested options and warrants to acquire shares of our common stock. These stockholders may be able to largely determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to largely control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nIf we fail to maintain proper internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required annually to deliver a report that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Due to our current filing status, we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or our independent auditors are unwilling or unable to provide us with an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for future periods as required by, or voluntarily followed under, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to produce accurate financial statements, and investors may therefore lose confidence in our operating results, our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of the Financing Agreement preclude us from paying dividends, and any future debt agreements may also preclude us from paying dividends. Any return to stockholders will be limited to the capital appreciation, if any, of their stock.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Nevada law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as certain provisions of Nevada law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if an acquisition would benefit our stockholders, and could also make it more difficult to remove our current management. These provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws include the following:\n\u25cf\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates; and\n\u25cf\nadvance notice provisions in connection with stockholder proposals that may prevent or hinder any attempt by our stockholders to bring business to be considered by our stockholders at a meeting or replace our board of directors.\nIn addition, we are subject to Nevada\u2019s Combination with Interested Stockholders statute (Nevada Revised Statute Sections 78.411 - 78.444), which prohibits an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d from entering into a \u201ccombination\u201d with a company, unless certain conditions are met. An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns (or within the prior two years, did beneficially own) 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s capital stock entitled to vote.\nGeneral Risks Related to our Business\nOur business may be affected by unfavorable publicity or lack of consumer acceptance.\nWe are highly dependent upon consumer acceptance of the safety and quality of our products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies. Consumer acceptance of a product can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, national media attention, and other publicity about product use, products themselves, or marketing campaigns for our products. A product may be received favorably, resulting in high sales associated with that product that may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change. Future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to our industry or any of our products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. A future research report or publicity that is perceived by consumers as less than favorable or that may question earlier favorable research or publicity could have an adverse effect on sales of our products and our ability to generate revenue. Adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research, statements by regulatory authorities or otherwise, whether or not accurate, that associates use of our products or any other similar products with illness or other adverse effects, or that questions the benefits of our products or similar products, or that claims that such products do not have the effect intended, or that question the marketing of our products, could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur success depends on how efficiently we respond to changing consumer preferences and demand.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer trends and preferences. We may not be able to respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to these changes. Our failure to accurately predict these trends could negatively impact our inventory levels, sales, and consumer opinion of us as a source for the latest product. The success of our new product offerings depends upon several factors, including our ability to achieve the following:\n\u25cf\naccurately anticipate consumer needs;\n\u25cf\ninnovate and develop new products;\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully commercialize new products in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\ncompetitively price our products in the market;\n\u25cf\nprocure and maintain products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and\n\u25cf\ndifferentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.\nIf we do not introduce new products, make enhancements to existing products, or maintain the appropriate inventory levels of our existing products to meet consumers\u2019 demand in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may initiate product recalls or withdrawals or may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions that could negatively affect our business.\nWe may be subject to product recalls, withdrawals, or seizures if any of the products we formulate, manufacture, or sell are believed to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations in the manufacture, labeling, promotion, sale, or distribution of any of our products. A recall, withdrawal, or seizure of any of our products could adversely affect consumer confidence in our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. In addition, a recall, withdrawal, or seizure of any of our products would require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProduct liability lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our products.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability claims as a result of the commercial availability of our current products and the clinical testing of our pharmaceutical product candidates despite obtaining appropriate informed consents from our clinical trial participants. Additionally, in light of the history of product liability claims related to other hormone therapy products and contraceptives, we will face an even greater risk through commercialization of our products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing, or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, failures to warn of dangers associated with the use of the product, negligence, strict liability, or breaches of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer fraud and protection statutes. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our existing products or pharmaceutical product candidates. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in any of the following:\n\u25cf\nthe inability to commercialize our products or pharmaceutical product candidates;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty recruiting subjects for clinical trials or withdrawal of these subjects before a trial is completed;\n\u25cf\nlabeling, marketing, or promotional changes and/or restrictions;\n\u25cf\nproduct recalls or withdrawals;\n\u25cf\ndecreased demand for our products or products that we may develop in the future;\n\u25cf\nloss of revenue;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u25cf\ninitiation of investigations by regulators or actions by state attorney generals or the U.S. Department of Justice;\n\u25cf\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources; and\n\u25cf\na decline in our stock price.\nAlthough we maintain general liability insurance and clinical trial liability insurance for our products and product candidates, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. In addition, our inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur manufacturing and research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical, biological, and radioactive materials. In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the U.S. govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials. Although we believe that our procedures for use, handling, storing, and disposing of these materials (all of which only occur at third-party sites operated by our contractors) comply with legally prescribed standards, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. We also cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced. Also, even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur liability as a result of any such contamination or injury. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources, and we do not carry liability insurance covering the use of hazardous materials. If we fail to comply with applicable requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs, or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve or maintain compliance. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific, and medical personnel. To induce valuable employees to remain with us, we have, among other things, provided stock-based compensation that vests over time. The value to employees of stock-based compensation will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we cannot control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific, and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Although we have employment agreements with several of our key employees, most employees are employed on an at-will basis, which means that any of these employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice, and may go to work for a competitor. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled scientific and medical personnel.\nA failure to maintain optimal inventory levels to meet commercial demand for our products could harm our reputation and subject us to financial losses.\nOur ability to maintain optimal inventory levels to meet commercial demand depends on the performance of third-party contract manufacturers. In some instances, our products have unique ingredients used under license arrangements. If our manufacturers are unsuccessful in obtaining raw materials, if we are unable to manufacture and release inventory on a timely and consistent basis, if we fail to maintain an adequate level of product inventory, if inventory is destroyed or damaged, or if our inventory reaches its expiration date, patients might not have access to our products, our reputation and brands could be harmed, and physicians may be less likely to recommend our products in the future, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDelays in clinical trials are common for many reasons, and any such delays could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval or commence or continue product sales.\nWe may experience delays in future clinical trials for our pharmaceutical product candidates or required post-approval clinical trials for our approved products. Clinical trials might not begin on time; may be interrupted, delayed, suspended, or terminated once commenced; might need to be amended or redesigned; might not enroll enough patients; or might not be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u25cf\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA, or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf\nimposition of a clinical hold because of safety or efficacy concerns by the DSMB, FDA, or IRB, or us;\n\u25cf\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf\ndelays in obtaining required central or local IRB approval for each clinical site;\n\u25cf\ndelays in identifying, recruiting, and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u25cf\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u25cf\ndelays in having patients\u2019 complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment or due to a lack of ability to enroll a certain number of patients in a trial;\n\u25cf\ntime required to add new sites;\n\u25cf\ndelays in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials, including suitable API; or\n\u25cf\ndelays resulting from negative or equivocal findings of DSMB for a trial.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials, and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Any of these delays in completing future clinical trials could increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue from our pharmaceutical product candidates, or continue to generate revenue from our approved products subject to post-approval clinical trials for our approved products, subject to the trial.\nClinical trials are lengthy and expensive with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical trials are expensive, can take many years to complete and have highly uncertain outcomes. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process because of inadequate performance of a drug, inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols, or other factors. New drugs in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy data and results despite having progressed through earlier clinical trials. Several companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials as a result of a lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, despite promising results in earlier trials. Our future clinical trials may not be successful or may be more expensive or time-consuming than we currently expect. Before approving a new drug, the FDA generally requires that the safety and efficacy of the drug be demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. In some situations, the FDA approves drugs based on a single well-controlled clinical trial. If clinical trials for any of our pharmaceutical product candidates fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA will not approve those product candidates and we will not be able to commercialize, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nFuture legislation, or the absence of such legislation, regulations, and policies adopted by the FDA or other regulatory authorities may increase the time and cost required for us to conduct and complete clinical trials for our pharmaceutical product candidates.\nThe FDA has established regulations, guidelines, and policies to govern the drug development and approval process, as have foreign regulatory authorities. Any change in regulatory requirements resulting from the adoption of new legislation, regulations, or policies may require us to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes. Such amendments to existing protocols or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones, may significantly and adversely affect the cost, timing, and completion of the clinical trials for our pharmaceutical product candidates.\nIn addition, the FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be issued that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of our pharmaceutical product candidates, or impose more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. For example, in the past the FDA has indicated it would regulate prenatal vitamins containing greater than 0.8 mg of folic acid as a drug under the FDCA. More recently the FDA indicated that there is no specified upper limit on the amount of folic acid permitted in a dietary supplement. If the FDA were to seek to regulate products with higher amounts of folic acid as drugs, it may require us to stop selling certain of our dietary supplement products and otherwise adversely affect our business. If we are slow or unable to adapt to any such changes, our business, prospects, and ability to achieve or sustain profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials because of adverse side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of our pharmaceutical product candidates.\nClinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time for many reasons. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, our collaborators, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities because of a failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, presentation of unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the investigational drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, or negative or equivocal findings of the DSMB or the IRB for a clinical trial. An IRB may also suspend or terminate our clinical trials for failure to protect patient safety or patient rights. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any proposed product that we develop, the commercial prospects of such proposed product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from any of these proposed products will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects significantly.\nOur business may be impacted by new or changing tax laws or regulations and actions by federal, state, and/or local agencies, or how judicial authorities apply tax laws.\nIn connection with the products we sell and intend to sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges and regulatory fees, or taxes, to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities. In addition, we incur and pay state and local taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of tax laws (including the recently enacted Tax Act) is uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and services. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse.\nIf we have incorrectly described, disclosed, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to maintain effective and efficient information systems or properly safeguard our information systems.\nOur operations are dependent on uninterrupted performance of our information systems. Failure to maintain reliable information systems, disruptions in our existing information systems or the implementation of new systems could cause disruptions in our business operations, including violations of patient privacy and confidentiality requirements and other regulatory requirements, increased administrative expenses and other adverse consequences.\nIn addition, information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of new technologies and the increased activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks resulting in the theft of protected health, business, or financial information. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, cyber-attacks increased as companies shifted to remote work environments, including several high-profile, sophisticated attacks impacting government agencies and security firms alike, the impacts of which are still being uncovered. Despite our layered security controls, experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our information systems and misappropriate or compromise sensitive patient or personnel information or proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that disable our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees to take actions, including the release of confidential or sensitive information or to make fraudulent payments, through illegal electronic spamming, phishing, or other tactics.\nA failure in or breach of our information systems because of cyber-attacks or other tactics could disrupt our business, result in the release or misuse of protected health information, or PHI, confidential or proprietary business information or financial loss, damage our reputation, increase our administrative expenses, and expose us to additional risk of liability to federal or state governments or individuals. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential patients and disruption of our operations. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of patient healthcare and other sensitive information, proprietary or confidential information about us or other third-parties could expose such persons\u2019 private information to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or such persons to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. Any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with foreign data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results.\nEuropean Union member states and other foreign jurisdictions, including Switzerland, have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. Moreover, the collection and use of personal health data in the European Union, which was formerly governed by the provisions of the European Union Data Protection Directive, was replaced with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, in May 2018. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the U.S., provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater. The recent implementation of the GDPR has increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, including in clinical trials, and we may in the future be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management\u2019s attention and increase our cost of doing business.\nOn July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued its long-awaited decision in the case Data Protection Commission v. Facebook Ireland, Schrems, or the Schrems II Decision. The Schrems II decision invalidates the European Commission\u2019s adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, calling into question personal data transfers from the EU to the U.S. While we have yet to determine the full impact of the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Framework on our business, we anticipate increased legal and technological costs as we evaluate any trans-Atlantic transfers as well as the impact on any business that we may conduct in the EU.\nIn addition, new regulation or legislative actions regarding data privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase our costs of doing business. In this regard, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the U.S., the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.\nOur employees and business partners may not appropriately secure and protect confidential information in their possession.\nEach of our employees and business partners is responsible for the security of the information in our systems or under our control and to ensure that private and financial information is kept confidential. Should an employee or business partner not follow appropriate security measures, including those related to cyber threats or attacks or other tactics, as well as our privacy and security policies and procedures, the improper release of personal information, including PHI, or confidential business or financial information, or misappropriation of assets could result. The release of such information or misappropriation of assets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately, or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained during clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nGeneral Risks Related to our Intellectual Property\nAnother party could develop competing pharmaceutical products and obtain FDA regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. before we do, potentially preventing our ability to commercialize our pharmaceutical products and other products in development.\nWe plan to seek to obtain market exclusivity for our pharmaceutical products and any other pharmaceutical product candidates we develop in the future. To the extent that patent protection is not available or has expired, FDA exclusivity may be the only available form of exclusivity available for these proposed products. These FDA exclusivities can delay the submission or the approval of certain drug applications. Potentially competitive products may also be seeking FDA exclusivities and may be in various stages of development, including some more advanced than us. We cannot predict with certainty the timing of FDA approval or whether FDA approval will be granted, nor can we predict with certainty the timing of FDA approval for competing products or whether such approval will be granted. It is possible that competing products may obtain FDA approval with exclusivities before we do, which could delay our ability to submit an application or obtain necessary regulatory approvals, result in lost market opportunities with respect to our pharmaceutical product candidates, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, litigation will be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our pharmaceutical product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any collaboration or other agreements we have entered into with regard to our technologies and products. We are aware of numerous third-party U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending applications that exist in the technical areas of our pharmaceutical products, including compounds, formulations, treatment methods, and synthetic processes, which may be applied towards the synthesis of hormones, for example. Patent applications are confidential when filed and remain confidential until publication, approximately 18 months after initial filing, while some patent applications remain unpublished until issuance. As such, there may be other third-party patents and pending applications of which we are currently unaware with claims directed towards composition of matter, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our products or product candidates. Therefore, we cannot ever know with certainty the nature or existence of every third-party patent filing. We cannot provide assurances that we or our partners will be free to manufacture or market our product candidates as planned or that we or our licensors\u2019 and partners\u2019 patents will not be opposed or litigated by third parties. If any third-party patent was held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our materials, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods of treatment related to the use or manufacture of any of our product candidates, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain a license to such patent on favorable terms or at all. Failure to obtain such license may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving intellectual property in the pharmaceutical industry generally. If a third party asserts that we infringe its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face many risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, including the following:\n\u25cf\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims, which would be costly and time-consuming to defend, whether or not we are ultimately successful, which in turn could delay the regulatory approval process, consume our capital, and divert management\u2019s attention from our business;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court determines that our products or technologies infringe a competitor\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies or future products unless the third party licenses its patents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms, which it is not required to do;\n\u25cf\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump sum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that license; or\n\u25cf\nredesigning our products so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nWe are party from time to time to legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property, and third parties in the future may file claims asserting that our technologies, processes, or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or our strategic partners or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. In addition, the outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. If we or our partners were to face infringement claims or challenges by third parties relating to our pharmaceutical product candidates, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to such third parties, and force us or our partners to curtail or cease the development of some or all of our pharmaceutical product candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of certain information, the value of our products and technology could be adversely affected.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. To protect this competitive position, we regularly enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties, including employees, independent contractors, suppliers, and collaborators. We cannot, however, ensure that these protective arrangements will be honored by third parties, and we may not have adequate remedies if these arrangements are breached. In addition, enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets, know-how, or technological advancements is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain. Non-U.S. courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect this information. Moreover, our trade secrets, know-how, and technological advancements may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in a manner providing us with no practical recourse against the competing parties. If any such events were to occur, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers or of other third parties with whom we have obligations of confidentiality.\nAs is common in the pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Such claims may lead to material costs for us, or an inability to protect or use valuable intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nGeneral Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock on Nasdaq is likely to be volatile. This volatility may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, which include the following:\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or proposed products, including clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our products;\n\u25cf\na decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial, or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u25cf\nadverse results or delays in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to obtain adequate supply for our products or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u25cf\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u25cf\nthe introduction of new products or technologies offered by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our or our licensees\u2019 commercialization efforts;\n\u25cf\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators, and the investment community;\n\u25cf\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nthe failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u25cf\nthe overall performance of the U.S. equity markets and general political and economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u25cf\nadverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u25cf\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf\nthe trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nincreases in our common stock available for sale upon expiration of lock-up agreements;\n\u25cf\neffects of natural or man-made catastrophic events or other business interruptions; and\n\u25cf\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the stock of biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of equity securities, convertible securities or other securities could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock.\nOur stockholders may experience dilution upon future equity issuances, including convertible debt or equity securities we may issue in the future, the exercise of stock options to purchase common stock granted to our employees, consultants and directors, including options to purchase common stock granted under our stock option and equity incentive plans or the issuance of common stock in settlement of previously issued awards under our stock option and equity incentive plans that may vest in the future.\nWe expect that additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell equity securities, convertible securities or other securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell equity securities, convertible securities or other securities current investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. We may also need our stockholders to authorize the issuance of additional shares of common stock under our articles of incorporation if we do not have sufficient authorized shares to raise such additional capital or issue future awards under our stock option and equity incentive plans. New investors could also gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our existing equity securities.", "PERMNO": 13863, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "TXMD"}
