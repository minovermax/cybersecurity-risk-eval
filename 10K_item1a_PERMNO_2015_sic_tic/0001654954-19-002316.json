{"cik": "1075736", "company": "Crexendo, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or to exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations have varied historically from period to period, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to retain existing customers and resellers, expand our existing customers\u2019 user base, and attract new customers;\n\u25cf\nour ability to introduce new solutions;\n\u25cf\nthe actions of our competitors, including pricing changes or the introduction of new solutions;\n\u25cf\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully penetrate the market for larger businesses;\n\u25cf\nthe mix of annual and multi-year subscriptions at any given time;\n\u25cf\nthe timing, cost, and effectiveness of our advertising and marketing efforts;\n\u25cf\nthe timing, operating cost, and capital expenditures related to the operation, maintenance and expansion of our business;\n\u25cf\nservice outages or information security breaches and any related impact on our reputation;\n\u25cf\nour ability to accurately forecast revenues and appropriately plan our expenses;\n\u25cf\nour ability to realize our deferred tax assets;\n\u25cf\ncosts associated with defending and resolving intellectual property infringement and other claims;\n\u25cf\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, or accounting rules;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and cost of developing or acquiring technologies, services or businesses, and our ability to successfully manage any such acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of worldwide economic, political, industry, and market conditions; and,\n\u25cf\nour ability to maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements.\nAny one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some or all of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period, which could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, a significant percentage of our operating expenses is fixed in nature and is based on forecasted revenues trends. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we may not be able to mitigate the negative impact on net income (loss) and margins in the short term. If we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, the market price of our shares could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class-action suits.\nWe have incurred operating losses in current and prior periods.\nWe sustained operating losses in the current and prior years. Our ability to obtain positive cash flows from operating activities will depend on many factors including, but not limited to, our ability to (i) improve sales and marketing efficiencies, (ii) reduce costs, (iii) reach more highly qualified prospects, and (iv) achieve operational improvements. We have incurred operating losses in each of the three prior years and may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. Continued losses could cause a determination that a \u201cgoing concern option\u201d should be applied to us.\nFluctuations in our operating results may affect our stock price and ability to raise capital.\nOur operating results for any given quarter or fiscal year should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our future results will fluctuate, and those results may fall below the expectations of investors and may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. This may impair our ability to raise capital, should we seek to do so. Our quarterly results may fluctuate based on, including but not limited to our sales results, marketing, management, our ability to compete, pricing, and other risk factors contained in this section.\nOur Chief Executive Officer owns a significant amount of our common stock and could exercise substantial corporate control. There may be limited ability to sell the company absent the consent of the CEO.\nSteven G. Mihaylo, Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of Crexendo, Inc., owns 70% of the outstanding shares of our common stock based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018. As a result, Mr. Mihaylo would have the ability to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, amalgamation, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Mr. Mihaylo may have the ability to control the management and affairs of our Company. As a \u201ccontrol company\u201d it may not be required that the company maintains an independent board. As a director and officer, Mr. Mihaylo owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Mihaylo is entitled to vote his shares, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. Accordingly, even though certain transactions may be in the best interests of other stockholders, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by, among other things, delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company, impeding a merger, amalgamation, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our Company, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company.\nIn addition, sales or other dispositions of our shares by Mr. Mihaylo may depress our stock price. Sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. As additional shares of our common stock become available for resale in the public market, the supply of our common stock will increase, which could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nSome of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium to the then market price. Our bylaws contain provisions regulating the introduction of business at annual stockholders\u2019 meetings by anyone other than the board of directors. These provisions may have the effect of making it more difficult, delaying, discouraging, preventing or rendering costlier an acquisition or a change in control of our Company.\nOur securities have been thinly traded. An active trading market in our equity securities may cease to exist, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock, in addition our stock price has been subject to fluctuating prices.\nOur common stock is traded exclusively in the over-the-counter market. We cannot predict the actions of market makers, investors or other market participants, and can offer no assurances that the market for our securities will be stable. If there is no active trading market in our equity securities, the market price and liquidity of the securities will be adversely affected. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. As of February 28, 2019, we had outstanding 14,394,113 shares of common stock.\nAdditional dilution will result if outstanding options to acquire shares of our common stock are exercised. In addition, in the event future financings are required they could be convertible into or exchangeable for our equity securities, investors may experience additional dilution.\nLack of sufficient stockholder equity or continued losses from operations could subject us to fail to comply with the listing requirements of the OTCQX, if that occurred, the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted, and our business will be harmed. We currently do not meet the minimum listing requirement for the NYSE or NASDAQ.\nOur common stock is currently listed on OTCQX. We have had annual losses from continuing operations for the last five years with the possibility of continued losses. While at current such losses would not impact our listing with OTCQX requirement may change from time to time and it is possible we may not remain in compliance with the minimum condition of OTCQX listing standards. Delisting from the OTCQX could negatively affect the trading price of our stock and could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers and employees, the failure to attract the interest of institutional investors, and fewer business development opportunities. At present we do not meet the minimum listing requirements for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the NASDAQ Stock Exchange (NASDAQ) which may make raising capital, issuing additional securities or using the securities of the Company to effect acquisitions or merger more difficult or expensive.\nWe may undertake acquisitions, mergers or change to our capital structure to expand our business, which may pose risks to our business and dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders.\nAs part of a potential growth strategy, we may attempt to acquire or merge with certain businesses. Whether we realize benefits from any such transactions will depend in part upon the integration of the acquired businesses; the performance of the acquired products, services and capacities of the technologies acquired, as well as the personnel hired in connection therewith. Accordingly, our results of operations could be adversely affected from transaction-related charges, amortization of intangible assets, and charges for impairment of long-term assets. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that any potential transaction will be successful.\nIn addition, the financing of any acquisition may require us to raise additional funds through public or private sources. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our stockholders. Future acquisitions by us could also result in large and immediate write-offs or assumptions of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards may be reduced in the event of an ownership change, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carry-forwards of approximately $22,722,000, of which $5,761,000 is subject to Section 382 limitations. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) imposes limitations on a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize its NOL carry-forwards. In general terms, an ownership change results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. Since our formation, we have issued a significant number of shares, and purchasers of those shares have sold some of them, resulting in two ownership changes, as defined by Code Section 382. As a result of the last ownership change, utilization of our NOL is subject to an annual limitation determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable federal long-term tax-exempt rate. The annual limitation is approximately $461,000. Any limited amounts may be carried over into later years, and the amount of the limitation may, under certain circumstances, be increased by the \u201crecognized built-in gains\u201d that occur during the five-year period after the ownership change (the recognition period). Future changes in ownership of more than 50% may also limit the use of these remaining NOL carry-forwards. Our earnings, if any, and cash resources would be materially and adversely affected if we cannot receive the full benefit of the remaining NOL carry-forwards. An ownership change could occur as a result of circumstances that are not within our control.\nThe telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We face intense competition from traditional telephone companies, wireless companies, cable companies and alternative voice communication providers and other VoIP companies.\nOur Cloud telecommunications services compete with other voice over internet protocol (VoIP) providers. In addition, we also compete with traditional telephone service providers which provide telephone service based on the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Our VoIP offering is not fully compatible with such customers. Some of these traditional providers have also added VoIP services. There is also competition from cable providers, which have added VoIP service offerings in bundled packages to their existing cable customers. The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We face intense competition from traditional telephone companies, wireless companies, cable companies, and alternative voice communication providers.\nMost traditional wire line and wireless telephone service providers, cable companies, and some VoIP providers are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of a large existing customer base. Because most of our target customers are already purchasing communications services from one or more of these providers, our success is dependent upon our ability to attract target customers away from their existing providers. Our competitors\u2019 financial resources may allow them to offer services at prices below cost or even for free in order to maintain and gain market share or otherwise improve their competitive positions.\nThe markets for our products and services are continuing to evolve and are increasingly competitive. Demand and market acceptance for recently introduced and proposed new products and services and sales of such products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk. Our business may suffer if the market develops in an unexpected manner, develops more slowly than in the past or becomes saturated with competitors, if any new products and services do not sustain market acceptance. A number of very large, well-capitalized, high profile companies serve the e-commerce, VoIP and Cloud technology markets. If any of these companies entered our markets in a focused and concentrated fashion, we could lose customers, particularly more sophisticated and financially stable customers.\nOur VoIP or cloud telecommunications service competes against established well financed alternative voice communication providers, (such as 8x8 and Ring Central) who may provide comparable services at comparable or lower pricing.\nPricing in the telecommunications industry is very fluid and competitive. Price is often a substantial motivation factor in a customer\u2019s decision to switch to our telephony products and services. Our competitors may reduce their rates which may require us to reduce our rates, which would affect our margins and revenues, or otherwise make our pricing non-competitive. We may be at a disadvantage compared with those competitors who have substantially greater resources than us or may otherwise be better positioned to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and brand awareness, and a larger base of customers than we have. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers. Our competitors may also offer bundled service arrangements that present a more differentiated or better integrated product to customers. Announcements, or expectations, as to the introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors or us could cause customers to defer purchases of our existing products, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nChanges to rates by our suppliers, competitors and increasing regulatory charges may require us to raise prices which could impact results.\nPricing in the telecommunications industry is very fluid and competitive. Price is often a substantial motivating factor in a customer\u2019s decision to switch to our cloud telecommunications products and services. Our competitors may reduce their rates which may require us to reduce our rates, which would affect our margins and revenues, or otherwise make our pricing non-competitive. Our upstream carriers, suppliers and vendors may increase their rates thus directly impacting our cost of sales, which would affect our margins. Interconnected VoIP traffic may be subject to increased charges. Should this occur, the rates paid to our underlying carriers may increase which could reduce our profitability. Changes in our underlying costs of sales may increase rates we charge our customers which could make us less competitive and impact our sales and retention of existing customers.\nWe have targeted sales to mid-market and larger enterprise customers. Not properly managing these customers could negatively affect our business, margins, cash flow and operations.\nSelling to larger enterprise customers contains inherent risks and uncertainties. Our sales cycle has become more time-consuming and expensive. The delays associated with closing and installing larger customers may impact results on a quarter to quarter basis. There may be additional pricing pressure in this market which may affect margins and profitability. Revenue recognition may be delayed for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. The loss of a large customer may have a material negative impact on quarterly or annual results.\nMulti-location users require additional and expensive customer service which may require additional expense and impact margins on enterprise sales. Enterprise customers may demand more features, integration services and customization which require additional engineering and operational time which could impact margins on an enterprise sale. Multi-location enterprise customer sales may have different requirement in different locations which may be difficult to fulfill or satisfy various interests which could result in cancellations.\nEnterprise customers might demand we provide service locations internationally where we may encounter technical, logistical, infrastructure and regulatory limitations on our ability to implement or deliver our services. Our inability to provide service in certain international locations may result in a cancellation of the entire contract. Further with larger enterprise customer sales, the risk of customers transporting desktop devices internationally without our knowledge may increase.\nSales to small and medium-sized businesses face risks as they may have fewer financial resources to weather an economic downturn.\nA substantial percentage of our revenues come from small and medium-sized businesses. These customers may be more adversely affected by economic downturns than larger, more established businesses. The majority of our customers pay for our subscriptions with credit and debit cards. Weakness in certain segments of the credit markets and in the U.S. and global economies may result in increased numbers of rejected credit and debit card payments, which could negatively affect our business. If small and medium-sized businesses experience financial hardship as a result of a weak economy, industry consolidation, or any other reason, the overall demand for our subscriptions could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe must acquire new customers on an ongoing basis to maintain and increase our customers and revenues.\nWe will have to acquire new customers in order to increase revenues. We incur significant costs to acquire new customers, and those costs are an important factor in determining our profitability. Therefore, if we are unsuccessful in retaining customers or are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers beyond those budgeted, our revenue could decrease, which could prevent us from reaching profitability and have our net loss increase. Marketing expenditures are an ongoing requirement and will become a larger ongoing requirement of our business.\nIf we do not successfully expand our sales including our partner channel program and direct sales, we may be unable to substantially increase our sales.\nWe sell our products primarily through direct sales and our partner channel, and we must substantially expand the number of partners and producing direct sales personnel to increase organic revenue substantially. If we are unable to expand our partner channel network and hire and retain qualified sales personnel, our ability to increase our organic revenue and grow our business could be compromised. The challenge of attracting, training, and retaining qualified candidates, may make it difficult to grow revenue.\nWe face risks in our sales to certain market segments including, but not limited to, sales subject to HIPPA Regulations.\nWe have sold and will continue to attempt to sell to certain customer segments which may have requirements for additional privacy or security. In addition sales may be made to customers that are subject to additional security requirements and or HIPPA requirements. Selling into segments with additional requirements increases potential liability which in some instances may be unlimited. While the Company believes it meets or exceeds all requirements for sales into such segments, there is no assurance that the Company systems fully comply with all requirements. Our customers can use our services to store contact and other personal or identifying information, and to process, transmit, receive, store and retrieve a variety of communications and messages, including information about their own customers and other contacts. In addition, customers may use our services to store protected health information, or PHI, that is protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, Noncompliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy and HIPAA may lead to significant fines, penalties or civil liability.\nOur collection, processing, storage, use, and transmission of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements, differing views on data privacy, or security breaches.\nWe collect, process, store, use, and transmit personal data on a daily basis. Personal data is increasingly subject to legal and regulatory protections around the world, which vary widely in approach and which possibly conflict with one another. In recent years, for example, U.S. legislators and regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, as well as U.S. states have increased their focus on protecting personal data by law and regulation and have increased enforcement actions for violations of privacy and data protection requirements. The European Commission also recently approved and adopted the GDPR, a new data protection law, which took effect beginning in May 2018. These data protection laws and regulations are intended to protect the privacy and security of personal data, including credit card information that is collected, processed, and transmitted in or from the relevant jurisdiction. Implementation of and compliance with these laws and regulations may be more costly or take longer than we anticipate, or could otherwise adversely affect our business operations, which could negatively impact our financial position or cash flows. Further, we have taken the position that the cost involved in continually protecting data under GDPR was exorbitant compared to the small revenue received from Countries subject to GDPR. As a consequence, we stopped hosting websites in GDPR-complaint Countries or Countries from which the bulk of business came from Countries subject to GDPR. We also took steps to block those Countries from accessing any other sites we host. Additionally, media coverage of data breaches has escalated, in part because of the increased number of enforcement actions, investigations, and lawsuits. As this focus and attention on privacy and data protection increases, we also risk exposure to potential liabilities and costs resulting from compliance with or any failure to comply with applicable legal requirements, conflicts among these legal requirements, or differences in approaches to privacy.\nWe could be liable for breaches of security on our website, fraudulent activities of our users, or the failure of third-party vendors to deliver credit card transaction processing services.\nWe engage in electronic billing and processing of our customers using secure transmission of sometimes confidential information over public networks. We have systems and processes in place that we deem more than sufficient and industry standard that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches. Our failure to protect against fraud or breaches may subject us to costly breach notification and other mitigation obligations, class action lawsuits, investigations, fines, forfeitures, or penalties from governmental agencies that could adversely affect our operating results. We may be unable to prevent our customers from fraudulently receiving goods and services. Our liability could also increase if a large fraction of transactions using our services involve fraudulent or disputed credit card transactions. We may also experience losses due to subscriber fraud and theft of service. Subscribers have, in the past, obtained access to our service without paying for monthly service and international toll calls by unlawfully using fraudulently obtained codes. If our existing anti-fraud procedures are not adequate or effective, consumer fraud and theft of service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe face risks in our strategy of designing and developing our own desktop telephones (\u201ddesktop devices\u201d).\nWe continue to primarily sell Crexendo \u00ae branded desktop devices, although, the Company also supports third party devices manufactured by Yealink, Cisco, and Polycom. Our desktop devices are being manufactured by third party vendors in China. The Crexendo branded desktop devices include firmware specifically designed for our cloud telecommunications services. If the phones are successfully manufactured there is no assurance of the acceptance of the desktop devices. Successful roll out is not guaranteed and is contingent on various factors including but not limited to; meeting certain industry standards, the availability of our vendors to meet agreed terms, supply from vendors being sufficient to meet demand, industry acceptance of the desktop devices, desktop devices meeting the needs of our customers, competitive pricing of the desktop devices, feature set of the desktop devices being up to competitive standards, regulatory approval as required of the desktop devices and competitor claims relating to the desktop devices. Our failure to be able to fully implement the sale of the Crexendo desktop devices or the inability to have desktop devices manufactured to meet our supply needs may cause us damage as well as require us to have to purchase desktop devices from other suppliers at a higher price which could affect sales and margins. Our desktop devices come preloaded with our firmware and are not currently intended to work with other competitors\u2019 or vendors' services.\nOur churn rate may increase in future periods due to customer cancellations or other factors, which may adversely impact our revenue or require us to spend more money to grow our customer base.\nOur customers generally have initial service periods of between three and five year and may discontinue their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period. In addition, our customers may renew for lower subscription amounts or for shorter contract lengths. We may not accurately predict cancellation rates for our customers. Our cancellation rates may increase or fluctuate because of a number of factors, including customer usage, pricing changes, number of applications used by our customers, customer satisfaction with our service, the acquisition of our customers by other companies and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or decrease the amount they spend with us, our revenue will decline, and our business will suffer.\nOur rate of customer cancellations may increase in future periods due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the financial condition of our customers or the state of credit markets. In addition, a single, protracted service outage or a series of service disruptions, whether due to our services or those of our bandwidth carriers, may result in a sharp increase in customer cancellations.\nIf we do not successfully expand our physical infrastructure and build diverse geo redundant locations, which require large investments, we may be unable to substantially increase our sales and retain customers.\nOur ability to provide cloud telecommunications services is dependent upon on our physical and cloud based infrastructure. While most of our physical equipment required for providing these services is redundant in nature and offers high availability, certain types of failures or malfunctioning of critical hardware/software equipment, including but not limited to fire, water or other physical damage may impact our ability to deliver continuous service to our customers. Act of God or terrorism or vandalism or gross negligence of person(s) currently or formerly associated with the company may result in loss of revenue, profitability and retaining and acquiring new customers.\nOur ability to recover from disasters, if and when they occur is paramount to offer continued service to our existing customers. In addition to our physical infrastructure, we have a cloud infrastructure deployment with AWS to provide continuous service to our customers in the event of a disaster or failure of our physical infrastructure. If our third-party service providers fail to maintain these facilities properly, or fail to respond quickly to problems, our customers may experience service interruptions. The failure of any of these third party service providers to properly maintain services may be subject to factors including but not limited to the following: (i) cause a loss of customers, (ii) adversely affect our reputation, (iii) cause negative publicity, (iv) negatively impact our ability to acquire customers, (v) negatively impact our revenue and profitability, (vi) potential law suits for not reaching E-911 services, and (vii) potential law suits for loss of business and loss of reputation.\nWe may not be able to scale our business efficiently or quickly enough to meet our customers' growing needs, in which case our operating results could be harmed.\nAs usage of our cloud telecommunications services by mid-market and larger distributed enterprises expands and as customers continue to integrate our services across their enterprises, we are required to devote additional resources to improving our application architecture, integrating our products and applications across our technology platform as well as expanding integration and performance. We will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support and services and regulatory compliance, to serve a growing customer base. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could cause to prevent acquisition of customers, impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. These issues could result in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, which could hurt our revenue growth and our reputation. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. These efforts may reduce revenue and our margins and adversely impact our financial results.\nOur success depends in part upon the capacity, reliability, and performance of our network infrastructure, including the capacity provided by our Internet bandwidth suppliers.\nWe depend on these companies to provide uninterrupted and error-free service. Some of these providers are also our competitors. We do not have control over these providers. We may be subject to interruptions or delays in network service. If we fail to maintain reliable bandwidth or performance that could significantly reduce customer demand for our services and damage our business.\nOur success depends in part upon the capacity, reliability, and performance of our telecom carriers, and their network infrastructure, including the capacity provided by our Tier 1 and non-Tier 1 Telecom suppliers for Telecom Origination and Termination Services\nWe depend on these companies to provide uninterrupted and error-free service telecom services, sourcing of DIDs, porting of numbers and delivering telephone calls from and to endpoints and devices on our network. Some of these providers are also our competitors. We do not have control over these providers. We may be subject to interruptions or delays in their service. If we fail to maintain reliable connectivity or performance with our upstream carriers it could then significantly reduce customer demand for our services and damage our business.\nOur ability to provide telecommunications services is dependent upon third-party facilities and equipment, the failure of which could cause delays or interruptions of our service and impact our revenue and profitability.\nOur ability to provide quality and reliable cloud telecommunications service is in part dependent upon the proper functioning of facilities and equipment owned and operated by third parties and is, therefore, beyond our control. Our cloud telecommunications service (and to a lesser extend our e-commerce services) requires our customers to have an operative broadband Internet connection and an electrical power supply, which are provided by the customer\u2019s Internet service provider and electric utility company and not by us. The quality of some broadband Internet connections may be too poor for customers to use our services properly. In addition, if there is any interruption to a customer\u2019s broadband Internet service or electrical power supply, that customer will be unable to make or receive calls, including emergency calls (our E-911 service), using our service. We outsource several of our network functions to third-party providers. If our third-party service providers fail to maintain these facilities properly, or fail to respond quickly to problems, our customers may experience service interruptions. The failure of any of these third party service providers to properly maintain services may be subject to factors including but not limited to the following: (i) cause a loss of customers, (ii) adversely affect our reputation, (iii) cause negative publicity, (iv) negatively impact our ability to acquire customers, (v) negatively impact our revenue and profitability, (vi) potential law suits for not reaching E-911 services, and (vii) potential law suits for loss of business and loss of reputation.\nWe rely on third parties to provide a portion of our customer service responses, initiate local number portability for our customers, deliver calls to and from PSTN and other public telephone VoIP/Wireless service providers and provide aspects of our E-911 service.\nWe offer our cloud telecommunications customers support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We may rely on third parties (sometimes outside of the U.S) to respond to customer inquiries. These third-party providers generally represent us without identifying themselves as independent parties. The ability of third-party providers to provide these representatives may be disrupted due to issues outside our control.\nWe also maintain an agreement with an E-911 provider to assist us in routing emergency calls directly to an emergency service dispatcher at the PSAP in the area of the customer\u2019s registered location and terminating E-911 calls. We also contract with a provider for the national call center that operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week to receive certain emergency calls and with several companies that maintain PSAP databases for the purpose of deploying and operating E-911 services. The dispatcher will have automatic access to the customer's telephone number and registered location information. If a customer moves their Crexendo service to a new location, the customer's registered location information must be updated and verified by the customer. Until that takes place, the customer will have to verbally advise the emergency dispatcher of his or her actual location at the time of an emergency 9-1-1 call. This can lead to delays in the delivery of emergency services\nInterruptions in service from these vendors could also cause failures in our customers\u2019 access to E-911 services and expose us to liability.\nWe also have agreements with companies that initiate our local number portability, which allow new customers to retain their existing telephone numbers when subscribing to our services. We will need to work with these companies to properly port numbers. The failure to port numbers may subject us to loss of customers or regulatory review.\nIf any of these third parties do not provide reliable, high-quality service, our reputation and our business will be harmed. In addition, industry consolidation among providers of services to us may impact our ability to obtain these services or increase our expense for these services.\nOur dependence on outside contractors and third-party agents for fulfillment of certain items and critical manufacturing services could result in product or delivery delays and/or damage our customer relations.\nWe outsource the manufacturing of certain products we sell and products we provide. We submit purchase orders to agents or the companies that manufacture the products. We describe, among other things, the type and quantities of products or components to be supplied or manufactured and the delivery date and other terms applicable to the products or components. Our suppliers or manufacturers potentially may not accept any purchase order that we submit. Our reliance on outside parties involves a number of potential risks, including: (i) the absence of adequate capacity, (ii) the unavailability of, or interruptions in access to, production or manufacturing processes, (iii) reduced control over delivery schedules, (iv) errors in the product, and (v) claims of third party intellectual infringement or defective merchandise. If delays, problems or defects were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, cause claims for damages to be filed against us, and negatively impact our consolidated operations and cash flows.\nErrors in our technology or technological issues outside our control could cause delays or interruptions to our customers.\nOur services (including cloud telecommunications and e-commerce) may be disrupted by problems with our technology and systems such as malfunctions in our software or facilities. In addition there may be service interruptions for reasons outside our control. Our customers and potential customers subscribing to our services have experienced interruptions in the past and may experience interruptions in the future as a result of these types of problems. Interruptions could cause us to lose customers and offer customer credits, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Network and Telecommunication interruptions may also impair our ability to sign-up new customers. In addition since our systems and our customers\u2019 ability to use our services are Internet-dependent, our services may be subject to \u201ccyber-attacks\u201d from the Internet, which could have a significant impact on our systems and services. Our customers\u2019 ability to use our services is dependent on third-party internet providers which may suffer service disruptions. If service interruptions adversely affect the perceived reliability of our service, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining customers and our growth may suffer.\nOur operations could be hurt by a natural disaster, network security breach, or other catastrophic event.\nWe maintain a fully redundant physical infrastructure in our data center in Tempe, Arizona and a cloud infrastructure deployment with AWS for disaster recovery. This system does not guarantee continued reliability if a catastrophic event occurs. Despite implementation of network security measures, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems including, but not limited to, denial of service attacks. In addition, if there is a breach or alleged breach of security or privacy involving our services including but not limited to data loss, or if any third party undertakes illegal or harmful actions using our communications or e-commerce services, our business and reputation could suffer substantial adverse publicity and impairment. We have experienced interruptions in service in the past. While we do not believe that we have lost customers as a consequence, the harm to our reputation is difficult to assess. We have taken and continue to take steps to improve our infrastructure to prevent service interruptions.\nFailure in our data center or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions.\nAll data centers, including ours, are subject to various points of failure. Problems with cooling equipment, generators, uninterruptible power supply, routers, switches, or other equipment, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions for our customers as well as equipment damage. Any failure or downtime could affect a significant percentage of our customers. The total destruction or severe impairment of our data center facilities could result in significant downtime of our services and the loss of customer data.\nInternet security issues and growing Cyber threats pose risks to the development of e-commerce and our business.\nSecurity and privacy concerns may inhibit the growth of the Internet and other online services generally, especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions.\nWe could experience security breaches in the transmission and analysis of confidential and proprietary information of the consumer, the merchant, or both, as well as our own confidential and proprietary information.\nAnyone able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations, as well as the operations of the merchant. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to minimize problems caused by security breaches. To the extent that we experience breaches in the security of proprietary information which we store and transmit, our reputation could be damaged and we could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation.\nWe collect personal and credit card information from our customers and employees could misuse this information.\nThe PCI Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d) is a specific set of comprehensive security standards required by credit card brands for enhancing payment account data security, including but not limited to requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, and software design. We maintain credit card and other personal information in our systems. Due to the sensitive nature of retaining such information we have implemented policies and procedures to preserve and protect our data and our customers\u2019 data against loss, misuse, corruption, misappropriation caused by systems failures, unauthorized access, or misuse. Notwithstanding these policies, we could be subject to liability claims by individuals and customers whose data resides in our databases for the misuse of that information. While the Company believes its systems meet or exceed industry standards, the Company does not believe it is required to meet PCI level 1 compliance and has not certified under that level. Failure to meet PCI compliance levels could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to collect and store credit card information which could cause substantial disruption to our business. Notwithstanding the results of this assessment there can be no assurance that payment card brands will not request further compliance assessments or set forth additional requirements to maintain access to credit card processing services, which could incur substantial additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend upon industry standard protocols, best practices, solutions, third-party software, technology, tools including but not limited to Open Source software.\nWe rely on non-proprietary third party licensing and software some of which may be Open Source and protected under various licensing agreements. We may be subject to additional royalties, license or trademark infringement costs or other unknown costs when one or more of these third-party technologies are affected or need to be replaced due to end-of-support or end-of-sale of such third parties.\nWe may incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party patent and trademark infringement claims regardless of their merit.\nFrom time to time, parties may assert patent infringement claims against us in the form of letters, lawsuits, and other forms of communication. Third parties may also assert claims against us alleging infringement of copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other proprietary rights or alleging unfair competition. If there is a determination that we have infringed third-party proprietary rights, we could incur substantial monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future.\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, and a loss of these individuals could adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan and grow our business.\nWe depend on the continued services of our key personnel, including our Officers and certain engineers. Each of these individuals has acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our operations. The loss of one or more of these key personnel could negatively impact our performance. In addition, we expect to hire additional personnel as we continue to execute our strategic plan, particularly if we are successful in expanding our operations. Competition for the limited number of qualified personnel in our industry is intense. At times, we have experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the necessary training or experience.\nOur public filings are subject to review by the SEC.\nOur SEC filings are reviewed by the SEC from time to time and any significant changes required as a result of any such review may result in material liability to us and have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nExaminations by relevant tax authorities may result in material changes in related tax reserves for tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or may impact the valuation of certain deferred income tax assets, such as net operating loss carry-forwards.\nBased on the outcome of examinations by relevant tax authorities, or as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related tax reserves for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred income tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) in future periods. It is not possible to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.\nChanges in our business model and sales strategies may adversely impact revenue.\nWhen the Company shifted away from a seminar sales model, our web services revenue was adversely impacted. Our website hosting revenue has continued to decline since we no longer sell our website development software through a seminar sales model. The Company is not actively marketing its website development software or website hosting services. Our web services segment revenue may continue to decline over time as more competitors enter the website building and hosting industry.\nFrom time to time we had been the subject of governmental inquiries and investigations related to our discontinued seminar sales model and business practices that could require us to pay refunds, damages or fines, which could negatively impact our financial results or ability to conduct business. We have received customer complaints and civil actions.\nFrom time to time, we received inquiries from federal, national, state, city and local government officials in the various jurisdictions in which we operated. These inquiries had historically been related to our discontinued seminar sales practices. There is still the potential of review of past sales and sales of our current web and telecom services. We respond to these inquiries and have generally been successful in addressing the concerns of these persons and entities, without a formal complaint or charge being made, although there is often no formal closing of the inquiry or investigation. The ultimate resolution of these or other inquiries or investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business or operations, or a formal complaint could be initiated. During the ordinary course of business, we also receive a number of complaints and inquiries from customers, governmental and private entities. In some cases, these complaints and inquiries from agencies and customers have ended up in civil court. We may continue to receive customer and agency claims and actions.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations could adversely impact our financial results or ability to conduct business.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations as well as oversight from a variety of governmental agencies and public service commissions. The laws governing our business may change in ways that harm our business. Federal or state governmental agencies administering and enforcing such laws may also choose to interpret and apply them in ways that harm our business. These interpretations are also subject to change. Regulatory action could materially impair or force us to change our business model and may adversely affect our revenue, increase our compliance costs, and reduce our profitability. In addition, governmental agencies such as the SEC, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Federal Communication Commission (FCC) and state taxing authorities may conclude that we have violated federal laws, state laws or other rules and regulations, and we could be subject to fines, penalties or other actions that could adversely impact our financial results or our ability to conduct business.\nThe FCC net neutrality rules have changed. We cannot predict the effect of this, nor the impact of this change on our business.\nOn January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, released an order that largely repeals rules that the FCC had in place which prevented broadband internet access providers from degrading or otherwise disrupting a broad range of services provisioned over consumers' and enterprises' broadband internet access lines. There are efforts in Congress to prevent the Order from becoming effective and a number of state attorneys general have filed an appeal of the FCC's January 4, 2018 order. We cannot predict whether the FCC's January 4, 2018 order will remain effective. Many of the largest providers of broadband services, like cable companies and traditional telephone companies, have publicly stated that they will not degrade or disrupt their customers' use of applications and services, like ours. If such providers were to degrade, impair, or block our services, it would negatively impact our ability to provide services to our customers, likely result in lost revenue and profits, and we would incur legal fees in attempting to restore our customers' access to our services. Broadband internet access providers may also attempt to charge us or our customers additional fees to access services like ours that may result in the loss of customers and revenue, decreased profitability, or increased costs to our offerings that may make our services less competitive. We cannot predict the potential impact of the FCC's January 4, 2018 order on us at this time.\nOur Telecommunications services are required to comply with industry standards, FCC regulations, privacy laws as well as certain State and local jurisdiction specific regulations failure to comply with those may subject us to penalties and may also require us to modify existing products and/or service.\nThe acceptance of telecommunications services is dependent upon our meeting certain industry standards. We are required to comply with certain rules and regulations of the FCC regarding safety standards. Standards are continuously being modified and replaced. As standards evolve, we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our products. We must comply with certain federal, state, and local requirements regarding how we interact with our customers, including marketing practices, consumer protection, privacy, and billing issues, the provision of 9-1-1 emergency service and the quality of service we provide to our customers. The failure of our products and services to comply, or delays in compliance, with various existing and evolving standards could delay future offerings and impact our sales, margins, and profitability. Changes to the Universal Service Funds by the FCC or various States may require us to increase our costs which could negatively affect revenue and margins.\nWe are subject to Federal laws and FCC regulations that require us to protect customer information. While we have protections in place to protect customer information there is no assurance that our systems will not be subject to failure or intentional fraudulent attack. The failure to protect required information could subject us to penalties and diminish the confidence our customers have in our systems which could negatively affect results. While we try to comply with all applicable data protection laws, regulations, standards, and codes of conduct, as well as our own posted privacy policies and contractual commitments to the extent possible, any failure by us to protect our users\u2019 privacy and data, including as a result of our systems being compromised by hacking or other malicious or surreptitious activity, could result in a loss of user confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could materially and adversely affect our business as well as subject us to law suits, civil fines and criminal penalties.\nGovernmental entities, class action lawyers and consumer advocates are reviewing the data collection and use by companies that must maintain such data. Our own requirements as well as regulatory codes of conduct, enforcement actions by regulatory agencies, and lawsuits by other parties could impose additional compliance costs on us as well as subject us to unknown potential liabilities. These evolving laws, rules and practices may also curtail our current business activities which may delay or affect our ability to become profitable as well as affect customers and other business opportunities.\nWe are also subject to the privacy and data protection-related obligations in our contracts with our customers and other third parties. Any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with federal, state, or international laws, or to comply with our contractual obligations related to privacy, could result in proceedings or actions against us which could result in significant liability to us as well as harm to our reputation. Additionally, third parties with whom we contract may violate or appear to violate laws or regulations which could subject us to the same risks.\nThere is considerable uncertainty with respect to the state of law governing data transfers between the European Union (\"EU\"), and other countries with similar data protection laws, and it remains unclear what the final resolution will be for cross-border data transfers of personal information. There may be risks associated with data transfer and customers who use International Locations.\nStates are adding regulation for VoIP providers which could increase our costs and change certain aspects of our service.\nCertain states take the position that offerings by VoIP providers are intrastate and therefore subject to state regulation. We have registered as a CLEC in most states, however our rates are not regulated in the same manner as traditional telephone service providers. Some states are also requiring that we register as a seller of VoIP services even though we have registered as a CLEC. Some states argue that if the beginning and desktop devices of communications are known, and if some of these communications occur entirely within the boundaries of a state, the state can regulate that offering and may therefore add additional taxes or surcharges or regulate rates in a similar matter to traditional telephone service providers. We believe that the FCC has pre-empted states from regulating VoIP providers in the same manner as providers of traditional telecommunications services. We cannot predict how this issue will be resolved or its impact on our business at this time.\nOur ability to offer services outside the U.S. is subject to different regulations which may be unknown and uncertain.\nRegulatory treatment of VoIP providers outside the United States varies from country to country, and local jurisdictions. Many times, the laws are vague, unclear and regulations are not enforced uniformly. We are licensed as a VoIP seller in Canada, and are considering expanding to other Countries. We also cannot control if our customers take their devices out of the United States and use them abroad. Our resellers may sell to customers who maintain facilities outside the United States. The failure by us or our customers and resellers to comply with laws and regulations could reduce our revenue and profitability. As we expand to additional Countries there may be additional regulations that we are required to comply with, the failure to comply or properly assess regulations may subject us to penalties, fines and other actions which could materially affect our business.", "PERMNO": 87404, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CXDO"}
