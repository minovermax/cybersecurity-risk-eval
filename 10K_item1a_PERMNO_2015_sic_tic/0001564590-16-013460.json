You should carefully consider these risk factors as each of these risks could adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business may suffer, the trading price of our common stock could decline and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may also adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to XTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide) capsules\nWe and Astellas may not be able to further commercialize XTANDI in the United States, and may fail to continue to generate significant revenue from the sale of XTANDI in the United States. XTANDI may fail to obtain regulatory approval and reimbursement, to be successfully commercialized and to generate significant revenue outside the United States.\nWe only have one commercial product, XTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide) capsules, or XTANDI, which is approved in the United States to treat men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC. However, the further commercialization of XTANDI in the United States for the treatment of mCRPC and any other patient populations for which XTANDI is being developed and may subsequently be approved, may not be successful for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe and our collaboration partner, Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Astellas, may not be able to establish or demonstrate in the medical community the safety and efficacy of XTANDI and its potential advantages over, and side effects compared to, competing therapeutics and products currently in clinical development for each applicable patient population;\n\u2022\nour limited experience in marketing XTANDI to urologists;\n\u2022\nreimbursement and coverage policies of government and private payors such as Medicare, Medicaid, insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators;\n\u2022\nthe price of XTANDI as compared to alternative treatment options;\n\u2022\nchanges or increases in regulatory restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges to the label for XTANDI that further restrict how we and Astellas market XTANDI, including as a result of routine pharmacovigilance activities and/or data collected from the safety study in patients with known risk factor(s) for seizure that the FDA required us to undertake as a post-marketing requirement or from any other ongoing or future studies;\n\u2022\nwe and Astellas may not have adequate financial or other resources to successfully commercialize XTANDI; and\n\u2022\nwe and Astellas may not be able to obtain adequate commercial supplies of XTANDI to meet demand or at an acceptable cost.\nIf the further commercialization of XTANDI in the United States is unsuccessful, our ability to generate revenue from product sales and maintain profitability would be adversely affected and our business could be severely negatively impacted.\nXTANDI has received marketing approval in the European Union (or Europe, or EU) for the treatment of patients with mCRPC and in Japan for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, and numerous other countries worldwide for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. Additional marketing applications for the mCRPC indication are under review in numerous other countries. Unless we and Astellas can obtain additional regulatory approval and reimbursement of XTANDI outside the United States, Japan and the EU, Astellas\u2019 ability to successfully commercialize XTANDI further and our ability to generate additional revenue from XTANDI worldwide, could be significantly limited.\nXTANDI may fail to effectively compete commercially with other approved products and other products in development.\nThere are a number of currently marketed therapies for advanced prostate cancer that compete directly with XTANDI. In addition, several companies are currently developing products or are expected to be marketing products in the near future that compete or may compete directly with XTANDI in its currently approved indication for mCRPC and any other indication for which enzalutamide may be subsequently approved. Our current and future competitors are generally large pharmaceutical companies with considerably greater financial, human, and development and commercialization resources and experiences than ours, including Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, and Bayer Pharma AG. Some competitive drugs already have acquired substantial shares in these markets or are generic which may make it more difficult for us to compete successfully in these markets notwithstanding any positive results that we may generate from our current or potential future clinical trials for enzalutamide. Also, intense competition from products and compounds in development could impact our ability to successfully conduct upstream clinical trials, as trials may become more difficult to enroll, or complete successfully, as patients may have more treatment options with demonstrated efficacy and safety. Factors upon which XTANDI would have to compete successfully include efficacy, safety, price and cost effectiveness. We cannot guarantee that we and Astellas will be able to compete successfully in the context of any of these factors.\nPricing pressure from third parties and price competition could substantially impact Astellas\u2019 or our ability to generate revenue from XTANDI and, therefore, negatively impact our business.\nThe realized price of XTANDI could be subject to pricing pressure from aggressive competitive pricing activity and managed care organizations and institutional purchasers, who use cost considerations to restrict the sale of preferred drugs that their physicians may prescribe. To the extent that payors believe similar lower-priced, branded or generic competitor products may be suitable alternatives for patients, we and our partner Astellas may consider reducing the price of XTANDI or be subject to formulary restrictions, which could result in a loss of sales revenue and/or market share. Additionally, XTANDI currently competes against products and could compete in the future with products marketed by some of the world\u2019s largest and most experienced pharmaceutical companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, who have more resources and greater flexibility to engage in aggressive price competition in order to gain revenues and market share. It is uncertain whether we and Astellas could successfully compete with such competition and our failure to compete or a decision to reduce the price of XTANDI in order to compete could severely impact our business.\nMoreover, non-profit groups have recently petitioned the U.S. federal government to exercise their \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights under the Bayh-Dole Act due to the difference in price of XTANDI in the U.S. versus abroad since certain patents which cover XTANDI were allegedly developed with federal funding. While the government has yet to exercise its march-in rights in response to pricing pressures or shortage problems, it may do so in the future which would significantly negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from XTANDI.\nCompetition from other approved products, including those that mechanistically operate similarly to XTANDI, could negatively impact the expected use or duration of therapy of XTANDI, and impact our ability to generate revenue.\nWe are competing and will continue to compete against drugs that operate similarly to XTANDI. If XTANDI is unable to successfully compete for a position in the prostate cancer treatment paradigm ahead of drugs like Zytiga and/or potentially apalutamide (formerly JNJ-56021927, or JNJ-927, and ARN-509), which are now being investigated in Phase 3 clinical studies in earlier stage prostate cancer, sales of XTANDI may be negatively impacted. In addition, the availability of multiple other approved agents to treat the same patients being treated with XTANDI could cause treating physicians to switch patients off of XTANDI and onto competing therapies more quickly than would otherwise be the case, which could also negatively impact XTANDI net sales.\nCompetition from generic products could potentially harm our business and result in a decrease in our revenue.\nLike other branded pharmaceutical companies, we face competition from generic products that could potentially harm our business and result in a decrease in our revenue. Such competition may arise from the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights on enzalutamide or a competitor product, or the approval by the FDA of a generic of our product or a competitor product, such as Zytiga, any of which could adversely affect our business by putting downward pressure on the price and market share of XTANDI. Generic products for the treatment of prostate cancer that have already been approved by the FDA, e.g., Casodex, are generally sold at a lower price than branded drugs. Furthermore, Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) requesting approval\nfor generic versions of Zytiga were submitted to the FDA on April 28, 2015. See the risk factor below entitled, \u201cRisks Related to the Pharmaceutical Industry, Including the Activities of Medivation, Inc.- If the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products that compete with any of our products or product candidates, the sales of our products or product candidates may be adversely affected,\u201d for additional information regarding general risks related to generic and biosimilar competition in our industry.\nWe have recently increased our promotional efforts and focus in the United States to include urologists as well as oncologists. If we are not successful in marketing XTANDI to these physician audiences, the commercial potential of XTANDI may not be realized.\nWe have recently increased promotional efforts in the United States to include urologists as well as oncologists as a result of the expanded label of XTANDI in the United States to treat mCRPC patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (September 2014). Our efforts include expanding and dividing our sales force into urology- and oncology-focused teams. Failure to successfully commercialize XTANDI to urologists and oncologists would have a negative impact on our business and future prospects.\nWe are dependent upon our collaborative relationship with Astellas to further develop, fund, manufacture and commercialize XTANDI, and if such relationship is unsuccessful, or if Astellas terminates our collaboration agreement with them, it could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business and generate revenue from XTANDI.\nUnder our collaboration agreement with Astellas, Astellas is responsible for developing, seeking regulatory approval for, and commercializing XTANDI outside the United States and is responsible globally for all manufacture of product for both clinical and commercial purposes. We and Astellas are jointly responsible for commercializing XTANDI in the United States. We and Astellas share equally the costs (subject to certain exceptions), profits and losses arising from development and commercialization of XTANDI in the United States. For clinical trials useful both in the United States and in Europe or Japan, we are responsible for one-third of the total costs and Astellas is responsible for the remaining two-thirds. We are subject to a number of risks associated with our dependence on our collaborative relationship with Astellas, including:\n\u2022\nAstellas\u2019 right to terminate the collaboration agreement with us on limited notice for convenience (subject to certain limitations), or for other reasons specified in the collaboration agreement;\n\u2022\nthe need for us to identify and secure on commercially reasonable terms the services of third parties to perform key activities currently performed by Astellas in the event that Astellas were to terminate its collaboration with us, including development and commercialization activities outside of the United States and manufacturing activities globally;\n\u2022\nadverse decisions by Astellas regarding the amount and timing of resource expenditures for the commercialization of XTANDI;\n\u2022\nadverse decisions by Astellas regarding whether or not to initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of proprietary rights protecting XTANDI or to determine the scope and validity of proprietary rights covering XTANDI or proprietary rights held by competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure by Astellas to negotiate favorable coverage determinations and adequate reimbursement rates with third-party payors;\n\u2022\ndecisions by Astellas to prioritize other of its present or future products more highly than XTANDI for either development and/or commercial purposes;\n\u2022\npossible disagreements with Astellas as to the timing, nature and extent of our development plans, including clinical trials or regulatory approval strategy, which if we disagree could significantly delay or halt development of XTANDI; and\n\u2022\nthe financial returns to us, if any, under our collaboration agreement with Astellas, depend in large part on the generation of product sales, and if Astellas fails to perform or satisfy its obligations to us, the development or commercialization of XTANDI would be delayed or may not occur and our business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nDue to these factors and other possible disagreements with Astellas, we may be delayed or prevented from further developing, manufacturing or commercializing XTANDI or we may become involved in litigation or arbitration, which would be time consuming and expensive. For example, we understand that Astellas has not made a final decision on the phase 3 clinical trial evaluating enzalutamide in triple negative breast cancer.\nIf Astellas were to terminate our collaborative relationship unilaterally, we would need to undertake development and commercialization activities for XTANDI solely at our own expense and/or seek one or more other partners for some or all of these activities, worldwide. If we pursued these activities on our own, it would significantly increase our capital and infrastructure requirements, might limit the indications we are able to pursue for XTANDI, and could prevent us from effectively commercializing XTANDI. If we sought to find one or more other pharmaceutical company partners for some or all of these activities, we may not be successful in such efforts, or they may result in collaborations that have us expending greater funds and efforts than our current relationship with Astellas.\nWe are dependent on third-party manufacturers for commercial supply of XTANDI and for clinical trial materials and if we fail to receive such adequate supplies, global sales of XTANDI could be limited and clinical trials could be delayed.\nWe require adequate supplies of enzalutamide for commercial supply of XTANDI, and for use in clinical trials. Under our collaboration agreement, Astellas has the responsibility to manufacture commercial supplies of XTANDI for all markets and provide material for clinical studies. Astellas fulfills its manufacturing and supply obligations largely through third-party contract manufacturers. Consequently, we are, and expect to remain, dependent on Astellas and its contract manufacturers for commercial and clinical trial materials. If Astellas cannot provide the materials on a timely basis due to, for example, raw materials availability, quality issues or failure of the contracting facilities to perform, it could result in decreased sales or put at risk ongoing clinical studies. If Astellas or its contract manufacturers do not perform, we may be forced to incur additional expenses, delays, or both, to arrange or take responsibility for contract manufacturers to manufacture or package XTANDI or enzalutamide on our behalf, as we do not have any internal manufacturing or packaging capabilities.\nWe also rely on our own third-party vendors for clinical supplies. If clinical supplies cannot be provided on a timely basis it could put at risk our sponsored clinical studies with XTANDI or enzalutamide.\nIn some instances, we and Astellas are dependent on third-party suppliers of raw materials, intermediates or finished goods of commercial supplies of XTANDI and clinical trial materials. If any of these suppliers or subcontractors fails to meet our or Astellas\u2019 needs, we may not have readily available alternatives. If we or Astellas experience a material supplier or subcontractor inability to supply, our ability to satisfactorily and timely complete our clinical trial or delivery obligations could be negatively impacted which could result in reduced sales, termination of contracts and damages to our relationships with clinical trial sites and the medical community. We could also incur additional costs to address and resolve such an issue. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on Astellas to distribute and sell XTANDI, and if Astellas fails to adequately perform these activities, our business would be negatively impacted.\nUnder our collaboration agreement with Astellas, we and Astellas have the right to jointly promote XTANDI to customers in the United States. However, Astellas has the sole right to distribute and sell XTANDI to customers in the United States and the sole right to promote, distribute and sell XTANDI to customers outside the United States. We are thus partially dependent on Astellas to successfully promote XTANDI in the United States, and solely dependent on Astellas to successfully distribute and sell XTANDI in the United States and to promote, distribute and sell XTANDI outside of the United States. In the United States, we depend on customer support from specialty pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers in Astellas\u2019 network. Astellas has contracted with a limited number of specialty pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers to deliver XTANDI to end users. The use of specialty pharmacies and wholesalers requires significant coordination with Astellas\u2019 sales and marketing, medical affairs, regulatory affairs, legal and finance organizations and involves risks, including but not limited to risks that these specialty pharmacies and wholesalers will:\n\u2022\nnot provide Astellas accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, patient- or account-level data or safety complaints regarding XTANDI;\n\u2022\nnot effectively sell or support XTANDI;\n\u2022\nnot devote the resources necessary to sell XTANDI in the volumes and within the timeframes that we expect; or\n\u2022\ncease operations.\nWe generally do not have control over the resource or degree of effort that any of the specialty pharmacies and distributors may devote to XTANDI, and if their performance is substandard, this will adversely affect sales of XTANDI. If Astellas\u2019 network of specialty pharmacies and distributors fails to adequately perform, it could negatively impact sales of XTANDI, which would negatively impact our business, results of our operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nXTANDI may not be commercially successful if not widely covered and appropriately reimbursed by third-party payors, and we are dependent upon Astellas for the execution of third-party payor access and reimbursement strategies for XTANDI.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize XTANDI for its approved indications depends, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for XTANDI is available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed care programs and other third-party payors, both in the United States and globally.\nIn addition, even if third-party payors ultimately elect to cover and reimburse XTANDI, most payors will not reimburse 100% of the cost, but rather require patients to pay a portion of the cost through a co-payment. Thus, even if reimbursement is available, the percentage of drug cost required to be borne by patients may make use of XTANDI financially difficult or impossible for certain patients, which would have a negative impact on sales of XTANDI. For example, in the United States there exists a coverage gap, or \u201cdonut hole\u201d, in the Medicare Part D coverage for prescription medications for participants, which renews annually each January 1st. While in the donut hole, Medicare Part D participants, including many patients in XTANDI\u2019s approved indication, may have to pay out-of-pocket a substantial portion of their prescription drug costs, which may discourage physicians from prescribing or patients from accessing XTANDI. It is increasingly difficult to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement levels from third-party payors, and we may be unable to achieve these objectives. Moreover, our commercial prospects would be further weakened if payors approve coverage for XTANDI only as second- or later-line treatments, or if they place XTANDI in tiers requiring unacceptably high patient co-payments. Since launch, several third-party payors have included in their coverage criteria use of XTANDI after patient treatment on Zytiga plus prednisone or if there is a contra-indication to prednisone or Zytiga. These coverage situations may persist even with expanded indications for XTANDI. Because XTANDI works via a similar molecular signaling pathway as Zytiga does, patients who have already failed treatment with Zytiga may not have as strong a response on XTANDI as would patients who are Zytiga-na\u00efve. Failure to overturn coverage decisions or stop additional coverage decisions could materially harm our (or our partner\u2019s) ability to successfully market XTANDI in the United States. Achieving coverage and acceptable reimbursement levels typically involves negotiating with individual payors and is a time-consuming and costly process. Therefore, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payor does not guarantee similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payor. Additionally, even if favorable coverage and adequate reimbursement levels are achieved, the payor may change its decision in the future. We are dependent upon Astellas globally for the achievement of such coverage and acceptable reimbursement, and for negotiation with individual payors.\nWe and Astellas are required to undertake certain studies to comply with post-marketing requirements or commitments in the EU and the United States, which could result in adverse modifications to XTANDI\u2019s existing labeling, and risk XTANDI\u2019s ability to obtain additional regulatory approvals for additional patient populations.\nIn the EU, we and Astellas are required to collect efficacy data on mCRPC patients previously treated with Zytiga to determine XTANDI\u2019s efficacy response in such patients, which we do not expect to be as good as in patients na\u00efve to Zytiga, and anticipate that these results may be available as early as 2016. In the United States, we and Astellas are required to conduct an open-label safety study of XTANDI in patients with known risk factor(s) for seizure and to report the results of that study to the FDA in 2019. If the results of this study reveal unacceptable safety risks, this could result in decreased commercial utilization of XTANDI for mCRPC patients in the United States and in the EU, failure to obtain approval in other indications, and modifications to the existing label for XTANDI, including potentially a boxed warning, or additional clinical testing. Any one or more of these outcomes would seriously harm our business. Additionally, we could receive additional post-marketing requirements as we seek approval of XTANDI in additional patient populations. Failure to conduct the post-marketing requirements or commitments in a timely manner may result in withdrawal of approval for XTANDI and substantial civil and/or criminal penalties.\nIf significant patient safety issues were to arise for XTANDI or our other product candidates, our future sales may be reduced, adversely affecting our results of operations.\nThe data supporting the marketing approvals for our products and forming the basis for the safety warnings in our product labels were obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration and, in some cases, from post-approval use. As our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients with underlying health problems, taking numerous other medicines, we expect to continue to find new issues such as safety, resistance or drug interactions of XTANDI or in other products, which may require us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels or narrow our approved indications, each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these products. For example, in 2015, based upon routine pharmacovigilance review and signal detection, we and Astellas submitted a label change to the FDA after identifying two post-marketing reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, or PRES, in patients receiving XTANDI. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. Because PRES was reported voluntarily from a post-marketing population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to XTANDI. Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES.\nRegulatory authorities have been moving towards more active and transparent pharmacovigilance and are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information directly available to the public through websites and other means, e.g., periodic safety update report summaries, risk management plan summaries and various adverse event data. Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action which may potentially cause our product sales or stock price to decline.\nFurther, if serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues arise with XTANDI, product sales could be limited or halted by us or by regulatory authorities and our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nXTANDI and any other product candidates that may receive regulatory approval in the future will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense as well as significant penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products and product candidates.\nWe are required to monitor the safety and efficacy of XTANDI and any other products candidates that are approved by the FDA. In addition, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for any approved products, such as XTANDI, will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing, as well as continued compliance with current good clinical practices, or cGCP, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. We must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for XTANDI and any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval in the future. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs, including biologics, are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we will not be able to promote XTANDI or any other products candidates for which we might obtain approval in the future for indications or uses for which they are not approved. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with XTANDI or any other product candidate for which we might obtain approval in the future, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned trials;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products\u2019 manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nuntitled or warning letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nrecall of products;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nimposition of civil penalties; or\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could affect the marketing of XTANDI or prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our other product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not sustain profitability.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop enzalutamide for breast cancer with a suitable diagnostic, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for enzalutamide for breast cancer or realize the full potential for enzalutamide.\nWe may initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating enzalutamide in triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC. A key element of our strategy to develop enzalutamide in TNBC is the use of a companion diagnostic to identify patients with TNBC appropriate for treatment with enzalutamide. Patients whose tumors test positive for a gene expression profile may be more likely to respond to treatment with enzalutamide; patients whose tumors test negative may not be responsive to treatment with enzalutamide. Both regulatory approval and, if approval is obtained, successful commercialization of enzalutamide in TNBC will, therefore, likely depend on our successful development of such a companion diagnostic.\nWe and Astellas have entered into a collaboration with NanoString Technologies, Inc. to translate our gene expression signature algorithm into a companion diagnostic assay using NanoString\u2019s nCounter Dx Analysis System. However, we may encounter difficulties in developing enzalutamide for TNBC and/or developing the companion diagnostic for clinical, regulatory and/or commercial reasons including issues related to analytical validation, reproducibility or clinical validation.\nCompanion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA as a medical device and require separate regulatory clearance prior to commercialization. Companion diagnostics are also subject to regulation by foreign regulatory authorities and such regulations may change or new regulations may be enacted during our development of the companion diagnostic. We may be unable to alter our development program in time to comply with the revised or new regulations, or we may only be able to do so by expending greater funds and efforts, and any delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval could delay or prevent the approval of enzalutamide for TNBC.\nRisks Related to our License and Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with CureTech, Ltd.\nThe clinical molecule MDV9300 we licensed from CureTech is a biologic molecule, and we do not have long-standing experience or expertise in the development, manufacture, or commercialization of biologic molecules.\nUnder the license agreement, we are responsible for all development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities for MDV9300 for all indications, including in oncology. We have limited history, experience, or expertise in the development, manufacturing and commercialization, including regulatory interactions, commercial manufacturing, and distribution of biologic molecules, like MDV9300.\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics involves a long, expensive, and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics, including:\n\u2022\nThe development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics are subject to regulation by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency or EMA, and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products;\n\u2022\nManufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living cells. Each lot of an approved biologic must undergo thorough testing for identity, strength, quality, purity and potency. Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary. Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, we may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity, strength, quality, purity or potency of the products before and after such changes. For MDV9300, we plan to implement changes in manufacturing site and to improve the manufacturing process to provide for larger manufacturing lot sizes, as well as the critical analytical assays. Comparability data will be required to support these changes; and\n\u2022\nThe use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, or closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. Any of these events could result in substantial costs.\nWe are currently dependent on CureTech to produce clinical supply of MDV9300 that meets global regulatory standards and CureTech is dependent on its suppliers for sufficient quantities of raw materials, starting materials, and supplies. If CureTech fails to manufacture clinical supply of MDV9300 in sufficient quantities or fails to source raw or starting materials or supplies in sufficient quantities, our ability to conduct clinical trials could be further delayed or otherwise negatively impacted.\nOur failure to successfully develop, manufacture, or commercialize MDV9300 could significantly impact our ability to generate value from the License Agreement with CureTech.\nThe IND for MDV9300 was recently placed on partial clinical hold by the FDA, and we now intend to modify the production process for MDV9300, resulting in a delay of our Phase 2 clinical trial of MDV9300 in DLBCL as well as potential subsequent trials.\nIn early January 2016, we advised the FDA of our conclusion that MDV9300 does not bind PD-1, and the agency placed the IND on partial clinical hold and requested that we revise our characterization of MDV9300 in the related investigator brochure, protocols and informed consent documents. While we submitted the revised documents in early February 2016, and the FDA has 30 days thereafter to notify us if the partial clinical hold is lifted, the FDA may request additional information in response to our submission or may determine that our response did not satisfactorily address their request. In addition, we intend to submit an amendment to our IND for MDV9300 to modify the production process to better support our planned clinical activities. We plan to submit the IND amendment in the first half of 2016 and intend that patients in our Phase 2 DLBCL trial will be treated with MDV9300 manufactured in accordance with the amended IND. Since we cannot enroll patients in the Phase 2 DLBCL trial until the partial clinical hold is lifted and do not intend to proceed with the trial until MDV9300 manufactured in accordance with the amended IND is available, there will be a delay in the resumption of our planned clinical trial of MDV9300 for DLBCL. These circumstances could result in increased cost and could delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate value from and realize the commercial potential of MDV9300.\nIf we are unable to determine the binding target for MDV9300, we may fail to successfully develop MDV9300 for DLBCL, multiple myeloma or any other indication, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or realize the full potential for MDV9300.\nAlthough the molecule was originally understood to work primarily via PD-1 (Programmed Death-1) binding, our work as well as that of others has shown other potential activity as well. In the year since we acquired rights to the molecule, we conducted testing and characterization work to better identify the binding target and, in late December 2015, we concluded that MDV9300 does not bind PD-1. While we intend to continue work to identify the binding target and thereafter develop a target-specific release assay, these activities are time consuming, expensive and there is no assurance that we will be successful since the binding mechanism is currently unknown. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will not experience additional development issues in the future which may cause further delays or unanticipated costs, or that we will be able to solve such development issues. Our failure to identify the binding target for MDV9300 or to develop a target-specific release assay would significantly impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval and could materially harm our business.\nThe development and commercialization of MDV9300 may face strong competition from other immuno-oncology agents that have already received marketing approval and are being developed for additional indications by larger companies with substantial resources and relatively more experience developing, manufacturing, and commercializing biologic molecules.\nThe immuno-oncology field is competitively crowded with more than 100 immuno-oncology agents, including biologic molecules, vaccines, modified T-cells, and adjuvants, currently approved and on the market or in development for various tumor types and patient populations by larger more experienced companies than ours, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche, AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Merck. This competitive environment could compromise our ability to develop MDV9300 by limiting the availability of clinical trial investigators, sites, and/or appropriate clinical patients, which could slow, delay or limit the progress of MDV9300\u2019s development. Even if we are able to successfully develop MDV9300 and obtain regulatory approval for it in an oncology indication, the competition from already approved immuno-oncology molecules and other agents in the same or similar oncology indications could significantly limit our ability to generate revenue from MDV9300. While we have some experience developing and in certain aspects of the commercialization of small molecule products, we may be required to hire additional qualified employees with experience developing, manufacturing, and commercializing, including regulatory interactions, commercial manufacturing, and distributing biological molecules, like MDV9300. Many of our competitors are large, multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with considerably more resources and experience with biological molecules than us.\nRisks Related to Our Future Product Development Candidates\nOur business strategy depends on our ability to identify and acquire additional product candidates. We may never acquire or identify such product candidates for reasons that may not be in our control, or are otherwise unforeseen or unforeseeable to us.\nA key component of our business strategy is to diversify our product development risk by identifying and acquiring new product opportunities for development. However, we may not be able to identify promising new technologies. In addition, the competition to acquire promising biomedical technologies is fierce, and many of our competitors are large, multinational pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies with considerably more financial, development and commercialization resources and experience than we have. Thus, even if we succeed in identifying promising technologies, we may not be able to compete against our larger competitors with considerably more financial resources or we may not be able to acquire rights to them on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to identify and acquire new technologies, we will be unable to diversify our product risk. We believe that any such failure would have a significant negative impact on our prospects.\nPharmaceutical and biological product candidates require extensive, time-consuming and expensive preclinical and clinical testing to establish safety and efficacy, and to obtain regulatory approval. If we are unable to successfully develop and test our product candidates, we will not be successful.\nThe research and development of pharmaceuticals and biological products is an extremely risky industry. Only a small percentage of product candidates that enter the development process ever receive regulatory approval. The process of conducting the preclinical and clinical testing required to establish safety and efficacy and obtain regulatory approval is expensive and uncertain and takes many years. If we are unable to complete preclinical or clinical trials of current or future product candidates, due to safety concerns with a product candidate, or if the results of these trials are not satisfactory to convince regulatory authorities of their safety or efficacy, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for commercialization. We cannot be certain if any of our product candidates will be approved by regulatory authorities. Furthermore, even if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates, those approvals may be for indications that are not as broad as desired or may contain other limitations that would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from sales of those products. If this occurs, our business would be materially harmed and our ability to generate revenue would be severely impaired.\nEnrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials of enzalutamide and other product candidates are expensive and time-consuming processes, could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by competing treatments or clinical trials of competing drugs in the same or other indications, and could result in significant delays, cost overruns, or both, in our product development activities, or in the failure of such activities.\nWe may encounter delays in enrolling, or be unable to enroll, a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our clinical trials, and even once enrolled we may be unable to retain a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our trials. Patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the existing body of safety and efficacy data with respect to the study drug, the number and nature of competing treatments and ongoing clinical trials of competing drugs for the same indication, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study. Furthermore, any negative results we may report in clinical trials of enzalutamide or any potential future product candidates may make it difficult or impossible to recruit and retain patients in other clinical studies of that same product candidate. Delays or failures in planned patient enrollment and/or retention may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop enzalutamide or any product candidates, or could render further development impossible.\nOur reliance on third parties for the operation of our business may result in material delays, cost overruns and/or quality deficiencies in our development programs.\nWe currently rely on third parties to perform key product development tasks, such as laboratories to conduct preclinical testing, clinical research organizations to help us manage our clinical studies, investigators and investigative sites who conduct the clinical trials, and contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture our product candidates at appropriate scale for preclinical and clinical trials. In addition, we currently rely on Astellas and its third party vendors to supply commercial quantities of XTANDI. To manage our business successfully, we will need to identify, engage and properly manage qualified third parties that will perform these development and manufacturing activities. For example, we need to monitor the activities of our vendors closely to ensure that they are performing their tasks correctly, on time, on budget and in compliance with strictly enforced regulatory standards. We need to monitor investigators who participate in our clinical trials to ensure that they are conducting the trial in compliance with the protocol, good clinical practices and all applicable laws. Our ability to identify and retain key vendors, investigators and investigative sites with the requisite knowledge is critical to our business and the failure to do so could negatively impact our business. Because all of our key vendors perform services for other clients in addition to us, we also need to ensure that they are appropriately prioritizing our projects. If we fail to manage our key vendors well, we could incur material delays, cost overruns or quality deficiencies in our development and commercialization programs, as well as other material disruptions to our business.\nPatient safety issues may arise from investigator-sponsored research with our product candidates, which may adversely affect our development program for such product candidates.\nWe are committed to improving patient care through research that advances the medical and scientific knowledge of XTANDI and our product candidates. In support of this commitment, we, in collaboration with our partner Astellas, have established an investigator-sponsored research program as a mechanism for independent researchers to seek support for preclinical and clinical research studies with enzalutamide. We also provide support for investigator-sponsored research with MDV3800 and MDV9300. However, because we are not the sponsor of investigator-sponsored research studies, we cannot control how such studies are conducted. If new patient safety issues arise from use of our product candidates in these investigator-sponsored research studies, our development programs may be adversely affected which could impact our business and the results of our operations.\nRisks Related to the Operation of our Business\nWe may incur substantial costs in the foreseeable future as we continue our development and commercialization activities and may not maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe have incurred significant costs principally from funding our research and development activities, from general and administrative expenses and from our XTANDI commercialization activities. We may incur substantial costs in the foreseeable future as we continue to finance the commercialization of XTANDI in the U.S. market, preclinical and clinical studies of enzalutamide, MDV3800, MDV9300 and early stage programs, potential business development activities, and our corporate overhead costs, which could impact our ability to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our ability to generate revenue sufficient to offset these costs in order to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis is dependent on our ability, alone or with collaboration partners, to successfully commercialize products for which we receive marketing approval.\nOur operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate. If our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market value of our common stock could decline.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. Due to the competitive market for mCRPC therapies, XTANDI net sales will be difficult to predict from period to period. As a result, you should not rely on XTANDI net sales results in any period as being indicative of future performance and sales of XTANDI may be below the expectation of securities analysts or investors in the future. Additionally, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements about expectations for future XTANDI net sales from our partner Astellas, as we may not agree with such statements, or from us, as XTANDI net sales results are difficult to predict. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe price and level of demand for XTANDI;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which coverage and reimbursement for XTANDI is available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed care programs and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nthe timing, cost and level of investment in our and Astellas\u2019 sales and marketing efforts to support XTANDI sales;\n\u2022\nthe timing, cost and level of investment in our research and development activities involving XTANDI and our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing XTANDI, and the amount of legally mandated discounts to government entities, other discounts and rebates, product returns and other gross-to-net deductions;\n\u2022\nthe risk/benefit profile, cost and reimbursement of existing and potential future branded and generic drugs which compete with XTANDI;\n\u2022\nthe timeliness and accuracy of financial information we receive from Astellas regarding XTANDI net sales globally, and shared U.S. development and commercialization costs for XTANDI incurred by Astellas, including the accuracy of the estimates Astellas uses in calculating any such financial information including for gross-to-net revenue adjustments;\n\u2022\ninventory levels at pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors;\n\u2022\nexpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional technologies, product candidates and products; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, we measure compensation cost for stock-based awards made to employees at the grant date of the award, based on the fair value of the award, and recognize the cost as a non-cash operating expense over the employee\u2019s requisite service period. As the variables that we use as a basis for valuing these awards change over time, including our underlying stock price and stock price volatility, the magnitude of the non-cash expense that we must recognize may vary significantly.\nWe are required to evaluate the fair value of intangible assets, including in-process research and development, or IPR&D, for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any change to our assumptions used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected loss of exclusivity, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical trial results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. If any of these or similar issues arise during development, we may need to re-evaluate our IPR&D and incur a non-cash impairment charge, adversely affecting our consolidated results of operations.\nAdditionally, each reporting period, we revalue contingent consideration obligations associated with business acquisitions to their fair value and record increases in fair value as non-cash contingent consideration expense and decreases in fair value as non-cash contingent consideration income. Changes in contingent consideration result from changes in assumptions regarding the probability of successful achievement of related milestones, the estimated timing in which the milestones may be achieved and the discount rates used to estimate the fair value of the liability. Contingent consideration may change significantly as our development programs progress, revenue estimates evolve and additional data is obtained, impacting our estimates.\nFor these and other reasons, it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future profits or losses. As a result, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nSales fluctuations of XTANDI as a result of inventory levels at Astellas\u2019 customers (such as pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors) may cause our revenue to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our financial results and the market value of our common stock.\nThe pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors with whom Astellas has entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end user demand and may not always be effective in matching their inventory levels to actual end user demand. As a result, changes in inventory levels held by those wholesalers and distributors can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if sales of XTANDI to these wholesalers do not match end user demand. Adverse changes in economic conditions or other factors may cause wholesalers and distributors to reduce their inventories of XTANDI. As inventory of XTANDI in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we may see corresponding fluctuations in reported collaboration revenue from XTANDI net sales.\nA significant and growing amount of the collaboration revenue we generate is in currency other than U.S. dollars, primarily the Euro and the Japanese yen, thereby exposing us to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nA significant and growing amount of our collaboration revenue is generated from royalties on ex-U.S. net sales of XTANDI. The royalties we receive from Astellas on net sales of XTANDI outside of the United States are calculated by converting the respective countries\u2019 XTANDI net sales in local currency to U.S. dollars for payment to us on a quarterly basis. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to current currency exchange rates would result in lower collaboration revenue related to ex-U.S. XTANDI net sales than otherwise would have been reported by us and paid to us.\nIn 2016, we intend to hedge a portion of our exposure to fluctuating currency rates for the Euro and the Japanese yen in order to mitigate unexpected short-term volatility of such rates. Depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates, if we fail to effectively hedge our exposures, we could experience adverse effects on our reported financial results.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates, identify and acquire promising new technologies, conduct our clinical trials, and commercialize our products, and our business could be harmed.\nOur future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified management to oversee our business. None of our executive officers is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term, and they may terminate their employment at any time. We are particularly dependent on the continued services of David Hung, M.D., our president and chief executive officer and a member of our board of directors. Dr. Hung identified enzalutamide for acquisition and has primary responsibility for identifying and evaluating other potential product candidates. We believe that Dr. Hung\u2019s services in this capacity would be difficult to replace.\nAlthough we have not historically experienced unique difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees, we could experience such problems in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields is intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area. The loss of any of our executive officers or a significant turnover in our senior management could impair the successful commercialization of XTANDI, delay or prevent continued development activities for enzalutamide, MDV3800, MDV9300 and other product candidates, delay or prevent the transfer and integration of MDV3800 into our business and adversely affect or preclude the identification and acquisition of new product candidates, any of which events could harm our business.\nIn addition, we will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our clinical development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms.\nWe may encounter difficulty managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nOur business has experienced significant growth, which we expect will continue as we expand our commercialization efforts for XTANDI, seek to advance our product candidates through clinical trials, and integrate the acquisition of MDV3800 and other potential business development activities. We expect that we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, and commercial capabilities in concert with contracting with third parties to provide certain of these activities for us. To that end, we must be able to hire, train and integrate additional personnel effectively in order to manage our commercialization and development activities.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. If we are not able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, it may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. In addition, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Thus, our future financial performance and our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively.\nWe will need to expand our organization to successfully commercialize our un-partnered product candidates outside of the United States in some degree, and we may experience difficulties, which could disrupt our operations and harm our business.\nWe have no experience marketing or selling outside of the United States. To successfully commercialize MDV3800, MDV9300, or any other products that emerge from our development programs, we will need to build or otherwise secure these capabilities from third parties. Developing a commercial infrastructure outside the United States is a significant undertaking that requires substantial financial and managerial resources. We may need to establish internal marketing and sales capabilities for several major ex-U.S. geographies to reach the commercial potential of MDV3800, MDV9300, or any other products that result from our development programs. Such expansion would require attracting, retaining and motivating the necessary skilled personnel and, in addition, it may require significant capital and operating expenditures. As a result, such activity may divert human and financial resources from other projects, such as the development or acquisition of additional product candidates. If we encounter unexpected or unforeseen delays in establishing a commercial infrastructure outside the United States, for example, it may negatively impact our ability to launch a commercial product or it may increase the cost and number of resources required for successful commercialization. In addition, it may negatively impact the future financial performance of our business and our ability to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our business. In the future, as a result of these financial and execution risks of expanding geographically ourselves, we may choose to partner with others who have existing capability to commercialize these products.\nOur significant level of debt and lease obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, we may not have sufficient funds to service our debt and lease obligations when payments are due.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $75.0 million outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $54.9 million of minimum lease commitments. We may incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs, including for example in connection with business development activities and for other general corporate purposes. Substantial indebtedness could have significant effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including with respect to our debt and lease obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nreduce the availability of our cash resources to fund our operations because we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash resources to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and lease payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less highly leveraged and that, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploring; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain financing.\nEach of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and viability.\nWith the acquisition of new product candidates in recent periods, we may need additional funds to support our operations, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, which would force us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our currently-planned development programs and other operations, to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or to determine to do any combination of the foregoing. Raising additional capital may subject us to unfavorable terms or conditions, may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, or may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates and technologies.\nWe require significant capital to fund our operations. We have historically funded our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, the issuance of the Convertible Notes (which we redeemed in July 2015 and are no longer outstanding), and from the upfront, milestone, and cost-sharing payments under agreements with our current and former collaboration partners, from collaboration revenue related to XTANDI net sales and, more recently and to a lesser extent, from short-term borrowings under a Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $225.9 million available to fund our operations. We expect to devote substantial financial resources to our future operations. Based on our current expectations, we believe our current capital resources, amounts available to us under our Revolving Credit Facility, and projected operating and other cash flows will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations for at least the next twelve months. This estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong, including assumptions regarding the amount and timing of net sales of XTANDI, potential XTANDI approvals in new markets and for other indications, and potential receipt of profit sharing and royalty payments under our Astellas Collaboration Agreement, causing us to exhaust our available cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments sooner than anticipated. For example, we may be required or choose to seek additional funds for the commercialization of XTANDI in the United States, to expand our preclinical and clinical development activities for enzalutamide, MDV3800, MDV9300 and other existing or potential future product candidates, to fund business acquisitions, investments or to in-license technologies, particularly if we face challenges or delays in connection with our clinical trials, and to maintain minimum cash balances that we deem reasonable and prudent. Our ability to raise additional funds on acceptable terms will be dependent on the climate of worldwide capital markets, which could be challenging for companies such as ours.\nWe may be constrained by our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility to operate our business to its full potential.\nThe terms of our Revolving Credit Facility contain customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness and dividends and other distributions. Furthermore, under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to comply with a maximum senior secured net leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio covenants. These terms may restrict our ability to operate our business in the manner we deem most effective or desirable, and may restrict our ability to fund our operations through new public offerings of our common stock or strengthen our candidate development pipeline through acquisitions or in-licenses which cause us to exceed our maximum senior secured net leverage ratio.\nFailure to comply with the representations and warranties or affirmative and negative covenants could constitute an event of default which, if continued beyond the cure period, would allow the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility), at the request of or with the consent of the Lenders holding a majority of the loans and commitments under the facility, to terminate the commitments of the Lenders to make further loans and declare all the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Revolving Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable, either of which would harm our business.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Our effective income tax rate in the future is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, future levels of research and development expenditures, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates in which we may conduct business, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, state income taxes, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, changes in estimates of prior years\u2019 items, tax costs for acquisition-related items, changes in accounting standards, non-deductible officers\u2019 compensation, limitations on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits due to changes in ownership, and overall levels of income before taxes. The impact of our income tax provision resulting from these items may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income.\nWe are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes in the United States. We may have additional exposure to non-income based tax liabilities.\nWe are regularly subject to audits by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, and we could be subject to assessments of additional taxes and/or substantial fines or penalties. The resolution of any audits or litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions. Although we believe that these transactions reflect arm\u2019s length terms and that proper transfer pricing documentation is in place, which should be respected for tax purposes, the transfer prices and terms and conditions of such transactions may be scrutinized by tax authorities, which could result in additional tax and/or penalties becoming due.\nIntellectual property protection for our product candidates is crucial to our business, and is subject to a significant degree of legal risk, particularly in the life sciences industry.\nThe success of our business will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection, primarily patent protection for the XTANDI product and any potential future product candidates, as well as successfully asserting and defending these patents against third-party challenges. We and/or our collaborators will only be able to protect the XTANDI product and our potential future product candidates from unauthorized commercialization by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them. Furthermore, future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means may afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us or our potential future collaborators to gain or keep our competitive advantage.\nThe patent positions of life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Further, changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be granted or enforced for our patents or for third-party patents that we have licensed. For example:\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nit is possible that none of our pending patent applications or the pending patent applications of our licensors will result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nour issued patents and future issued patents, or those of our licensors, may not provide a basis for protecting commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged by third parties and invalidated or rendered unenforceable; and\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies or product candidates that are patentable.\nFurther, even if we can obtain protection for and defend the intellectual property position of the XTANDI product or any potential future product candidates, we or any of our potential future collaborators still may not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing drugs. Should this occur, we and our potential future collaborators may not generate any revenues or profits from the XTANDI product or any potential future product candidates or our revenue or profits would be significantly decreased.\nWe could become subject to litigation or other challenges regarding intellectual property rights, which could divert management attention, cause us to incur significant costs, prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and/or subject us to competition by lower priced generic products.\nDuring the course of obtaining patent protection, we may receive rejections from national patent offices or be subject to pre-grant opposition proceedings instituted by third parties. Even after a patent is granted and issued by the national patent office, many countries allow post-grant opposition proceedings. In the U.S., these post-grant opposition proceedings include inter partes review whereby a third party can seek to challenge and invalidate an issued patent in an administrative proceeding before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, rather than through litigation in court, which is often lengthier and costlier. Our patents and patent applications, or those of our licensors, could face other challenges, such as interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, re-examination proceedings, derivation proceedings and pre-grant submissions. Any such challenge, if successful, could result in the invalidation of, or in a narrowing of the scope of, any of our patents and patent applications subject to the challenge. Any such challenges, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to defend and resolve and would divert our management\u2019s time and attention.\nGeneric and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are and have been very aggressive in challenging the validity of patents held by proprietary pharmaceutical companies, especially if these patents are commercially significant. Pursuant to the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, the XTANDI patents listed in the FDA \u201cOrange Book\u201d could be challenged by generic manufacturers as early as four years from the initial approval of the XTANDI product in the United States, which occurred on August 31, 2012. Companies seeking approval to market a generic version of a reference drug may also seek to challenge the validity of patents listed in the Orange Book or other patents covering such reference drug by filing petitions for inter partes review with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. If a generic pharmaceutical company or other third party were able to successfully invalidate any of our present or future\npatents, the XTANDI product and any potential future product candidates that may ultimately receive marketing approval could face additional competition from lower-priced generic products that would result in significant price and revenue erosion and have a significantly negative impact on the commercial viability of the affected product candidate(s).\nIn addition, we may be a party to litigation to protect our intellectual property or to defend our activities in response to alleged infringement of a third party\u2019s intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation, or a narrowing of the scope, of our proprietary rights. These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to litigate and resolve and would divert management time and attention. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us or our potential licensees to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ndiscontinue our products that use or are covered by the challenged intellectual property; or\n\u2022\nobtain from the owner of the allegedly infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we or our potential licensees are forced to take any of these actions, our business may be seriously harmed. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance does not cover potential claims of this type.\nWe may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement to protect our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors. These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel and we may not prevail in making these claims.\nWe rely on license agreements for certain aspects of our product candidates and our technology, and failure to meet our obligations under those agreements could severely negatively impact our business, and ability to generate revenue.\nWe have entered into agreements with third-party commercial and academic institutions to license intellectual property rights and technology. For example, we have a license agreement with UCLA pursuant to which we were granted exclusive worldwide rights to certain UCLA patents related to XTANDI and a family of related compounds. Some of these license agreements, including our license agreement with UCLA, contain diligence and milestone-based termination provisions, in which case our failure to meet any agreed upon diligence requirements or milestones may allow the licensor to terminate the agreement. If our licensors terminate our license agreements or if we are unable to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive license agreements, we may be unable to continue to develop and commercialize XTANDI or any potential future product candidates based on licensed intellectual property rights and technology.\nIn the future, we may need to obtain additional licenses of third-party technology that may not be available to us or are available only on commercially unreasonable terms, and which may cause us to operate our business in a more costly or otherwise adverse manner that was not anticipated.\nFrom time to time we may be required to license technology from additional third parties to further develop XTANDI and any future product candidates. Should we be required to obtain licenses to any third-party technology, including any such patents based on biological activities or required to manufacture our product candidates, such licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain any third-party license required to develop any of our product candidates could cause us to abandon any related development efforts, which could seriously harm our business and operations.\nWe may become involved in disputes with Astellas, NanoString or any potential future collaborators over intellectual property ownership, and publications by our research collaborators and scientific advisors could impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, which, in either case, could have a significant impact on our business.\nInventions discovered under research, material transfer or other such collaboration agreements, including the Astellas Collaboration Agreement or NanoString collaboration agreement, may become jointly owned by us and the other party(ies) to such agreements in some cases and the exclusive property of one of the parties in other cases. Under some circumstances, it may be difficult to determine who owns a particular invention, or whether it is jointly owned, and disputes could arise regarding ownership of those inventions. These disputes could be costly and time consuming and an unfavorable outcome could have a significant adverse effect on our business if we were not able to protect or license rights to these inventions. In addition, our research collaborators and scientific advisors generally have contractual rights to publish our data and other proprietary information, subject to our prior review. Publications by our research collaborators and scientific advisors containing such information, either with our permission or in contravention of the terms of their agreements with us, may impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, which could significantly harm our business.\nTrade secrets may not provide adequate protection for our business and technology.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our or any\npotential collaborators\u2019 employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. If we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, our enforcement efforts would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods or know-how, it will be more difficult or impossible for us to enforce our rights and our business could be harmed.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems to record and maintain financial, clinical trial, safety, laboratory and other corporate records. The size and complexity of our computerized information systems make them vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, catastrophic events, computer viruses, and human error. We have experienced at least one successful intrusion into our computer systems, and although it did not have a material adverse effect on our operations, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future as cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity.\nWe have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach; however, such measures cannot provide absolute security, and we have taken and are continually taking additional security measures to protect against any future intrusion, including employee training. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access our systems and confidential information and our relationships with third party vendors, who may or could have access to our confidential information, increases the risk of data security breaches.\nA data or security breach of our systems, or that of our third party vendors, such as third party clinical research organizations, third party clinical manufacturing organization, clinical trial sites, and administrators of our corporate employee benefit plans or of our current and potential future collaboration partners, could lead to public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers and other business partners, modification of or prevent us from accessing our clinical trial databases, or the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property.\nIf we or our third party vendors or business partners experience significant data security breaches, we could suffer harm to our reputation, be compelled to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, be subjected to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, be subjected to mandatory corrective action or government enforcement action, need to verify the correctness of clinical trial database contents, or be exposed to litigation claims. In addition, because these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Prolonged disruption would divert management\u2019s attention and could result in a delay to the development of our product candidate.\nWhile we do carry some insurance for these types of claims, our insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount.\nRisks generally associated with our company-wide implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe commenced implementation of a company-wide ERP system to upgrade certain existing business, operational, and financial processes. ERP implementations are typically complex and time-consuming projects that may require substantial time and resources to complete. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience delays or cost overruns during the ERP implementation process, or if the ERP system or associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect.\nRisks Related to the Pharmaceutical Industry, Including the Activities of Medivation, Inc.\nOur industry is highly regulated by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies. We must comply with extensive, strictly enforced regulatory requirements to develop, obtain, and maintain marketing approval for any of our product candidates.\nSecuring FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy for its intended use. It takes years to complete the testing of a new drug, biologic or medical device and development delays and/or failure can occur at any stage of testing. Any of our present and future clinical trials may be delayed, halted or approval of any of our products may be delayed or may not be obtained due to any of the following:\n\u2022\nany preclinical test or clinical trial may fail to produce safety and efficacy results satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\npreclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results from a preclinical test or clinical trial or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a preclinical study or clinical trial to be repeated or a program to be terminated, even if other studies or trials relating to the program are ongoing or have been completed and were successful;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities can place a clinical hold on a trial if, among other reasons, it finds that patients enrolled in the trial are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury;\n\u2022\nthe facilities that we utilize, or the processes or facilities of third party vendors, including without limitation the contract manufacturers who will be manufacturing drug substance and drug product for us or any potential collaborators, may not complete successful inspections by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities; and\n\u2022\nwe may encounter delays or rejections based on changes in FDA policies or the policies of foreign regulatory authorities during the period in which we develop a product candidate or the period required for review of any final regulatory approval before we are able to market any product candidate.\nIn addition, information generated during the clinical trial process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the approval process. Moreover, early positive preclinical or clinical trial results may not be replicated in later clinical trials. Failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the applicable product candidate. There can be no assurance that if clinical trials are completed, either we or our collaborative partners will submit applications for required authorizations to manufacture or market potential products or that any such application will be reviewed and approved by appropriate regulatory authorities in a timely manner, if at all.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and we may become subject to such litigation. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nCommercialization of drugs and biologics that receive FDA approval are subject, directly or indirectly, to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal False Claims Act and the state law equivalents of such laws. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing, and education programs.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willingly soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad, and despite a series of narrow regulatory safe harbors and statutory exceptions, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include, among other things, criminal and administrative penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, including private insurance programs.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons and entities from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim, or the knowing use of false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government, and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in a proportion of any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to have to defend False Claims Act actions. When it is determined that an entity has violated the False Claims Act, the entity may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. Although we have developed, implemented, and continue to improve a program for compliance with all federal and state laws, we cannot guarantee that our compliance program will be sufficient or effective, that our employees will comply with our policies and that our employees will notify us of any violation of our policies, that we will have the ability to take appropriate and timely corrective action in response to any such violation, or that we will make decisions and take actions that will necessarily limit or avoid liability for whistleblower claims that individuals, such as employees or former employees, may bring against us or that governmental authorities may prosecute against us based on information provided by individuals. If one or more individuals bring a whistleblower claim against us or if a governmental authority prosecutes a claim against us on the basis of information provided by one or more individuals, and if we are found liable and a fine and/or an injunction and/or a Corporate Integrity Agreement or similar government oversight program is imposed on us or we agree to pay a fine and/or accept an injunction and/or a Corporate Integrity Agreement or similar government oversight program in settlement of the claim, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and impair or prevent us from conducting our business. In addition, the costs and fees associated with defending a whistleblower claim would be significant.\nWe may also be subject to federal criminal healthcare fraud statutes that were created by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH. The HIPAA health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, and/or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The HIPAA false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and/or imprisonment.\nWe, and our business activities, are also subject to the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which is within the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act, (collectively, \u201cPPACA\u201d). The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and other healthcare providers. In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation on payments made to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices, and/or the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and remuneration to physicians.\nWe are unable to predict whether we could be subject to actions under any of these or other fraud and abuse laws, or the impact of such actions. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments to non-U.S. government officials for purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to comply with the FCPA or related laws governing the conduct of business with foreign government entities could disrupt our business and lead to severe criminal and civil penalties, including criminal and civil fines, denial of government reimbursement for our products and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Other remedial measures could include further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies, and controls and potential personnel changes and/or disciplinary actions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We could also be affected by any allegation that we, or any third party vendors that we rely on to perform key product development tasks, violated such laws.\nIf the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products that compete with any of our products or product candidates, the sales of our products or product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOnce an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201clisted drug\u201d which, in turn can be relied upon by potential competitors in support of an approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. U.S. laws and other applicable policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for a generic substitute. These manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use, or labeling, as our product or product candidate and that the generic product is bioequivalent to ours, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as our product or product candidate. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals, would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of sales of any branded product is typically lost to the generic product. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents to our products or product candidates would materially adversely impact our revenues, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments that we have made in our product candidates.\nTo the extent that we receive regulatory approval to market biological products in the future, we will face competition from biosimilar products. A growing number of companies have announced their intention to develop biosimilar products, some of which could potentially compete with our product candidates. Because of the abbreviated pathway for approval of biosimilars in the United State and abroad, we may in the future face greater competition from biosimilar products. This additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nHealthcare reform initiatives and other third party cost-containment pressures could cause us to sell our products at lower prices, resulting in decreased revenues.\nThe United States and some foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to profitably sell XTANDI and other product candidates should they receive marketing approval. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nIn March 2010, the PPACA became law in the United States. PPACA substantially changed and will continue to change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry. The provisions of PPACA most relevant to the pharmaceutical industry include:\n\u2022\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain governmental health care programs, not including orphan drug sales;\n\u2022\nan increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022\nMedicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers\u2019 outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level beginning in 2014, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\na new requirement to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in PPACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any payment or \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\na licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; and\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nWe anticipate that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria or maximum monthly out-of-pocket costs for patients, either of which could put additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement of our products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and expected revenue and profitability which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we will face competition from other approved drugs against which we compete, and the marketers of such other drugs are likely to be significantly larger than us and therefore enjoy significantly more negotiating leverage with respect to the individual payors than we may have.\nWe could experience adverse outcomes under existing litigation or become subject to product liability or other litigation, which could harm our ability to efficiently and effectively conduct our business, and, if successful, could materially and adversely harm our business and financial condition as a result of the costs of liabilities that may be imposed thereby.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the development, manufacturing, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical products. If XTANDI, MDV3800, MDV9300 or any other potential future product candidate harms people, or is alleged to be harmful, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, health care providers, corporate partners or others. We have product liability insurance covering commercial sales of XTANDI and our ongoing clinical trials. However, the amount of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we may be exposed to significant litigation costs and liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position. If we are sued for injuries allegedly caused by XTANDI, MDV3800, MDV9300 or any other of our current or future product candidates, our litigation costs and liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for XTANDI and any potential future product candidate that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any other products that we may develop.\nIn addition, we may from time to time become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of our business, such as our litigation with the Regents of the University of California, or Regents. See Part II, Item 1, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for additional information on this litigation. Any litigation to which we are subject could require significant involvement of our senior management and may divert management\u2019s attention from our business and operations. Litigation costs or an adverse result in any existing litigation, including our litigation with the Regents for which a decision by the appellate court on the appeal is due within 90 days of the oral argument which occurred on February 23, 2016, or any new litigation that may arise from time to time may adversely impact our operating results or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Business Acquisitions, Licenses, Investments and Strategic Alliances\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate MDV3800, MDV9300 or any other potential future product candidates we may acquire or we may otherwise fail to realize their full potential.\nA key component of our business strategy is to diversify our product development risk by identifying and acquiring new product opportunities for development such as our recent acquisition of MDV3800 from BioMarin and our earlier license of MDV9300 from CureTech. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to manage the risks associated with the transfer of development, regulatory and manufacturing activities for the ongoing clinical trials of MDV3800 from BioMarin to us or manage the risks associated with integrating MDV3800 and MDV9300 into our existing business and infrastructure. We may encounter unexpected difficulties during the transfer, integration or further development of MDV3800 or MDV9300, any of which may cause us to expend greater funds and efforts or may slow, delay or limit the progress of MDV3800\u2019s or MDV9300\u2019s development. Unexpected difficulties may further be disruptive to our ongoing development efforts, put a strain on our existing personnel, infrastructure and business and divert management\u2019s time and attention.\nOther companies, such as AstraZeneca, Clovis Oncology, AbbVie, and Tesaro are developing PARP inhibitors for various oncology indications, some of which have already been approved and on the market and others which are further along in development than MDV3800, both of which could limit our development opportunities for MDV3800. The competitive environment could further compromise our ability to successfully enroll the ongoing clinical trial by limiting the availability of clinical trial investigators, sites and/or patients which could slow, delay or limit the progress of MDV3800\u2019s development.\nAs a result of these or other problems and risks, we may never receive regulatory approval for MDV3800 or MDV9300, we may not realize the full potential or we may never generate significant value or revenues from these assets.\nBusiness acquisitions, licenses, investments and strategic alliances could disrupt our operations and may expose us to increased costs and unexpected liabilities.\nWe may acquire or make investments in other companies, enter into other strategic relationships, or in-license technologies, such as our acquisition of MDV3800 and license of MDV9300. To do so, we may use cash, issue equity that could dilute our current stockholders, or incur debt or assume indebtedness. These transactions involve numerous risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating acquired technologies, products, operations, and personnel with our existing business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention in connection with both negotiating the acquisition or license and integrating the business;\n\u2022\nstrain on managerial and operational resources;\n\u2022\ndifficulty implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting at businesses that we acquire, particularly if they are not located near our existing operations;\n\u2022\nexposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies or companies in which we invest;\n\u2022\npotential costly and time-consuming litigation, including stockholder lawsuits;\n\u2022\npotential issuance of securities to equity holders of the company being acquired which may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe need to incur additional debt or use our existing cash balances; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement to record potentially significant additional future non-cash operating costs for the amortization of intangible assets and potential future impairment or write-down of intangible assets and/or goodwill as well as potentially significant non-cash adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities which would be recorded within operating expenses.\nAs a result of these or other problems and risks, businesses we acquire or invest in may not produce the revenues, earnings or business synergies that we anticipated, acquired or licensed technologies may not result in regulatory approvals, and acquired or licensed commercial products may not perform as expected. As a result, we may incur higher costs and realize lower revenues than we had anticipated. We cannot assure you that any acquisitions or investments we have made or may make in the future will be successfully identified and completed or that, if completed, the acquired business, licenses, investments, products, or technologies will generate sufficient revenue to offset the negative costs or other negative effects on our business. Failure to manage effectively our growth through acquisition or in-licensing transactions could adversely affect our growth prospects, business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow.\nFunding may not be available for us to make acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or in-license technologies in order to grow our business.\nWe have made and anticipate that we may continue to engage in strategic transactions to grow our business through acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or in-licensing of technologies. In particular, we may choose to partner in certain geographies to commercialize our successful product candidates. Our growth plans rely, in part, on the successful identification and completion of these various strategic transactions. At any particular time, we may need to raise substantial additional cash or issue additional equity to finance such transactions, in addition to any amounts available from operations or under our Revolving Credit Facility. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funding on acceptable terms, or at all, or obtain stockholder approvals necessary to issue additional equity to finance such transactions. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining financing, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur consolidated financial statements may be impacted in future periods based on the accuracy of our valuations of our acquired businesses and other agreements.\nCertain of our asset acquisition or license agreements may be accounted for as a business combination. Accounting for business combinations may involve complex and subjective valuations of the assets and liabilities recorded, and in some instances contingent consideration, which is recorded in our consolidated financial statements pursuant to the standards applicable for business combinations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Differences between the inputs and assumptions used in the valuations and actual results experienced at a later date could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nWe have substantial intangible assets and goodwill as a result of the acquisition of MDV3800 from BioMarin and the license of MDV9300 from CureTech. A significant impairment or write-down of intangible assets and/or goodwill would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are required to perform an annual, or in certain situations a more frequent, assessment of intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment for accounting purposes. We recorded significant intangible assets and goodwill as a result of the CureTech and BioMarin transactions during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we had intangible assets and goodwill of approximately $662.9 million, or approximately 46% of our total assets. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $30.0 million impairment charge related to our IPR&D asset for MDV9300. If our development activities with respect to IPR&D for acquired product candidates are not successful in future periods, we may be required to incur further non-cash impairment charges that could materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or our recorded assets and liabilities.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and our stockholders\u2019 investment in our common stock could decline in value.\nThe market prices for our securities and those of other life sciences companies have been highly volatile and often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies, and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. There has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of life sciences companies because of problems or successes in a given market segment or because investor interest has shifted to other segments. These broad market and industry factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our operating performance. We have no control over this volatility and can only focus our efforts on our own operations, and even these may be affected due to the state of the capital markets.\nThe following factors, in addition to other risk factors described herein, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\ncomments made by securities analysts, including changes in their recommendations;\n\u2022\nselling by existing stockholders and short-sellers;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our directors, officers or significant stockholders, including sales effected pursuant to predetermined trading plans adopted under the safe-harbor afforded by Rule 10b5-1;\n\u2022\nnegative opinions that are misleading and/or inaccurate regarding our business, management or future prospects published by certain market participants intent on putting downward pressure on the price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nlack of volume of stock trading leading to low liquidity;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us of financing transactions and/or future sales of equity or debt securities;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts related to collaboration revenue generated from net sales of XTANDI, including the timing and amount thereof, and other financial metrics;\n\u2022\nchanges in our financial guidance or financial estimates by any securities analysts who might cover our company, or our failure to meet our financial guidance or estimates made by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nnew products, product candidates or uses for existing products or technologies introduced or announced by our competitors and the timing of these introductions and announcements;\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates conducted by us, Astellas or any future collaborative partners or licensees, if any, and any delays in enrolling a sufficient number of patients to complete clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our collaboration with Astellas or any future collaborations;\n\u2022\nour dependence on third parties, including Astellas, clinical manufacturing organizations and clinical research organizations, clinical trial sponsors and clinical investigators;\n\u2022\nlegislation or regulatory developments in the United States or other countries affecting XTANDI or product candidates, including those of our competitors, including the passage of laws, rules or regulations relating to healthcare and reimbursement or the public announcement of inquiries relating to these subjects;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe receipt or failure to receive funding necessary to conduct our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nlitigation; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance, including market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.\nThese factors and fluctuations, as well as political and other market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Securities-related class action litigation is often brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Securities-related litigation, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and financial resources, which could harm our business and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock. Additionally, volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain or recruit key employees, all of whom have been or will be granted equity awards as a part of their compensation.\nIf our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nVarious securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results, our projected development expenses, as well as the analysts\u2019 estimates of our future performance. The analysts\u2019 estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. We expect our projected development expenses to increase as we advance our product pipeline and grow our infrastructure. While management believes these expenses are an investment in the Company\u2019s long-term prospects, such expenses could substantially reduce our near-term earnings below the expectations of security analysts. If our operating results are below their expectations, the market value of our common stock could decline, perhaps substantially.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect for the foreseeable future to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to pay cash dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our success in completing sales or partnerships of our programs, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions (such as our Revolving Credit Facility) and applicable law.\nProvisions of our corporate charter documents, our stockholder rights plan and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our stockholders.\nProvisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay, deter or prevent a change in control. The anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. Specifically, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless its application has been waived, provides certain default anti-takeover protections in connection with transactions between us and an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d Generally, Section 203 prohibits stockholders who, alone or together with their affiliates and associates, own more than 15% of the subject company from engaging in certain business combinations for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder of such subject company without approval of the board or the vote of two-thirds of the shares held by the independent stockholders. Our board of directors has also adopted a stockholder rights plan, or \u201cpoison pill,\u201d which would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer. Additionally, provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including without limitation, the authority of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, which could cause our stock price to fall and cause dilution to existing stockholders. In addition, a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, including in connection with potential in-licensing and acquisition transactions. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock would dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock.\nThe issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock that were previously restricted from sale in the public market, or the perception that these issuances or sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. As a result, investors may not be able to sell their shares of our securities at a price equal to or above the price they paid to acquire them.\nFurthermore, the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or the perception that such issuances might occur, could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nWe rely on Astellas to timely deliver important financial information relating to net sales of XTANDI. In the event that this information is inaccurate, incomplete, or not timely, we may not be able to timely or fully meet our financial reporting obligations as required by the SEC.\nUnder the Astellas Collaboration Agreement, Astellas has exclusive control over the flow of information relating to net sales of XTANDI that we are dependent upon to meet our SEC reporting obligations. Astellas is required under the Astellas Collaboration Agreement to provide us with timely and accurate financial data related to net sales of XTANDI so that we may meet our reporting obligations under federal securities laws. In the event that Astellas fails to provide us with timely and accurate information, we may incur significant liability with respect to federal securities laws, our internal controls and procedures under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may be inadequate, and we could be required to record adjustments in future periods, any of which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and subject us to securities litigation.\nTo the extent that we create any joint ventures or have any variable interest entities for which we are required to consolidate, we would need to rely on those entities to timely deliver important financial information to us. In the event that the financial information is inaccurate, incomplete, or not timely, we would not be able to meet our financial reporting obligations as required by the SEC.\nWhile we currently do not have any joint ventures or variable interest entities that we are required to consolidate, to the extent we create such joint ventures or variable interest entities for which we would be required to consolidate and the financial statements of such entities are not prepared by us, we will not have direct control over their financial statement preparation. As a result, we will, for our financial reporting, depend on what these entities report to us, which could result in us adding monitoring and audit processes, which could increase the difficulty of implementing and maintaining adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. This may be particularly true when such entities do not have sophisticated financial accounting processes in place, or where we are entering into new relationships at a rapid pace, straining our integration capacity. Additionally, if we do not receive the information from the joint venture or variable interest entity on a timely basis, this could cause delays in our external reporting obligations as required by the SEC.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, accounting principles could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions.\nFor example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, is currently working together with the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow U.S. GAAP under SEC regulations and those who are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards outside of the United States. These efforts by the FASB and the IASB may result in different accounting principles under U.S. GAAP that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including, but not limited to, principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC require an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm attesting to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at the end of the fiscal year. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC. If we cannot in the future favorably assess, or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.", "PERMNO": 91141, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MDVN"}
