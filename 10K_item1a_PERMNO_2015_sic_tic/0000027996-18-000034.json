{"cik": "27996", "company": "DELUXE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all known material risks. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect us. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock or other securities.\nThe following important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements we make from time to time regarding our expected future results, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding revenue, earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and expected cost savings. Any forecast reflects various assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties and, as a matter of course, may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors that are beyond our control. Consequently, we caution investors that forward-looking statements are predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse. You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated statements, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical and forward-looking information made available by us, and other information affecting us and our products and services, including the following factors.\nWe may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies.\nWe continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained revenue and earnings growth with a focus on increasing marketing solutions and other services revenue, particularly treasury management, data-driven marketing solutions and web services. We believe these revenue streams represent our most significant growth opportunity. We have invested and plan to continue investing in several key enablers to achieve our strategies, including strengthening our portfolio of products and services, particularly technology-based solutions; investing in acquisitions; attracting and retaining customers; scaling our service offerings; enhancing brand awareness and positioning; growing our major accounts and dealer networks; and improving the customer experience. Our business strategies could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022\nour failure to generate profitable revenue growth;\n\u2022\nour failure to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;\n\u2022\nour inability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nour failure to effectively operate, integrate or leverage the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our digital services and products to achieve widespread customer acceptance;\n\u2022\nour inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;\n\u2022\nour inability to implement improvements to our technology and other key assets to increase efficiency, enhance our competitive advantage and scale our operations;\n\u2022\nour failure to effectively manage the growth, expanding complexity and pace of change of our business and operations; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nIn addition, we are focused on targeting our financial technology (\"FinTech\") solutions to larger financial institutions. These FinTech offerings include data-driven marketing solutions, including outsourced marketing campaign targeting and execution; treasury management solutions; and digital engagement solutions, including loyalty and rewards programs. If we are able to increase sales of these services to larger financial institutions, we may experience fluctuations in revenue driven by our clients' marketing campaign cycles. This may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict the timing of revenues and to meet short-term expectations of operating results. The resulting customer concentration could also increase our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments affecting our significant customers, and our top customers\u2019 purchasing power could, in some cases, give them the ability to make greater demands with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general.\nWe can provide no assurance that our growth strategies will be successful either in the short-term or in the long-term, that they will generate a positive return on our investment, or that they will not reduce our operating margins. Additionally, if our strategies are not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategies are not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may decline.\nIf we are unable to attract customers in a cost-effective manner or effectively develop and operate a multichannel customer experience, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including direct mail advertising, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, broadcast media, advertising banners, social media and other online links. The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. Additionally, our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have, at times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and the increasing use of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. In an attempt to offset these impacts, we continually modify our marketing and sales efforts and continue to shift a greater portion of our advertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies may not be successful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset a decline in response rates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts.\nIn addition to print and email advertising, many customers come to our websites through internet search engines. If the search engines on which we rely modify their algorithms or terminate their relationship with us, fewer customers may be directed to our websites. As we analyze our overall advertising strategy, we may be forced to resort to more costly resources to replace lost internet traffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the cost of purchased search engine listings will likely increase as demand for them continues to grow, and further cost increases could negatively affect our profitability.\nWe believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience for our customers. Customers expect to be able to order products and services from us however they please, whether that is via the mail, land-line phone, computer, tablet or\nmobile phone. In particular, smart phones and tablet computing devices are increasingly being used as the primary means for accessing the internet and conducting e-commerce. Designing and purchasing custom products on mobile devices is more difficult than doing so with a traditional computer due to limited screen sizes, bandwidth and other variables. Beyond these difficulties, the development of mobile-oriented user interfaces and other technologies is complex and expensive. We are also dependent on the functionality of our systems with web browsers, mobile devices and operating systems that are controlled by third parties. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. Network carriers may also impact the ability to access specified content on mobile devices, and with the repeal of net neutrality rules in December 2017, network carriers could, at their discretion, negatively impact the speeds of our websites. In this situation, it may be necessary to pay additional fees for higher internet speeds, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nAlthough we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and repeat visitors to our websites and convert these visitors to customers, which would result in decreased revenue.\nThe check printing and related products portion of the payments industry is mature, and check usage is declining.\nCheck printing continues to be a significant portion of our business. Revenue generated by the sale of checks was 43% of our consolidated revenue in 2017. We sell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks for the foreseeable future, although the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990's. According to the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December 2016, the total number of checks written declined 4.8% each year between 2012 and 2015. We believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire and ACH transfers, and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines.\nIn addition, steps have been taken in the development of a real-time payments system in the United States. The Federal Reserve established the Faster Payments Task Force with the objective of identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a faster payments system. In late 2017, The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC (TCH) implemented a clearing and settlement system allowing consumers and businesses to send and receive payments in real-time directly from their accounts at financial institutions. The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) adopted Same-Day ACH rules to speed up the processing of ACH payments and systems such as Zelle\u00ae, Venmo\u00ae, Apple Pay\u00ae and various other mobile applications allow individuals to transfer funds to other users. In addition, cryptocurrencies have been gaining acceptance in the marketplace.\nThe rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSmall Business Services' standardized business forms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences.\nRevenue generated by the sale of business forms was 11% of our consolidated revenue in 2017. Continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, small businesses now have alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms. Greater acceptance of electronic signatures also contributes to the overall decline in printed products. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will achieve widespread acceptance and replace standardized business forms. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition in all areas of our business, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.\nAlthough we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from some retailers. In addition, the suppliers of small business and financial services products and services are intensely competitive, highly fragmented and geographically dispersed. Current and potential competitors for our Small Business Services segment include traditional storefront printing companies; office superstores; companies offering website design and hosting and domain name registration; wholesale printers; online printing companies; email and social media marketing services companies; small business products and services resellers; media directory providers; and offline and online suppliers of custom apparel, promotional products and customized gifts. Additionally, the\ncompetitive landscape for online small business suppliers continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced and traditional businesses establish an online presence. Current and potential competitors for Financial Services service offerings include financial institution core banking software providers, advertising agencies, providers of data and analytics marketing solutions, and numerous FinTech service providers offering services such as customer and account acquisition, fraud and security risk management, receivables management and treasury support services, and rewards and loyalty solutions. In addition, many of our potential financial institution clients have historically developed their key applications in-house and thus, we must compete with their in-house capacities. For financial institutions, switching from one vendor to another can be a significant undertaking, with some potential clients perceiving disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality, conversion costs and business disruption. Through our ongoing efforts to expand well beyond our legacy check-related products, we strive to overcome this resistance to changing vendors. We offer several solutions designed to help financial institutions operate more effectively and better address the needs of their customers throughout the customer life cycle, building on our reputation as a longstanding and trusted partner of financial institutions. However, our clients may continue to be reluctant to change suppliers and they may be hesitant to rely on outsourced solutions.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. In recent years, our revenue has benefited from price increases in all 3 of our business segments. Pricing is becoming more competitive for product and service providers, as the internet allows customers to easily compare prices. Pricing also continues to be competitive in our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future while remaining competitive. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially harm our reputation and business.\nInformation security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and increased use of the internet, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists, some of which may be linked to hostile nation-state actors. We use internet-based channels that collect customers\u2019 account and credit card information, as well as other sensitive information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. We process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and small businesses. The secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, and of the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage and transmission of information, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' personally identifiable information. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, employee or contractor error, or malfeasance by rogue employees.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees and contractors. We have experienced distributed denial of service attacks by hackers aimed at disrupting internet traffic and/or attempting to place illegal or abusive content on our or our customers\u2019 websites. Additionally, our customers and employees have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent \"phishing\" emails to misappropriate personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through \"trojan horse\" programs to our users' computers. To-date, these various threats have not materially impacted our business or financial results. However, we can provide no assurance of a similar result in the future.\nAlthough we invest in a system of information security and controls, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers' personal and proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services, and result in the termination of client contracts. Additionally, it is possible that there could be vulnerabilities that could impact large segments of mobile, computer or server architecture. Any of these events would adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, if we were to experience an information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts to remedy, protect against, or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a lawsuit regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, any of which would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nIn addition, there are federal, state and international laws requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which could negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make\nsuch a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.\nInterruptions to our website operations or information technology systems, or failure to maintain our information technology platform, could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others: human error, software errors, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism, and other events beyond our control. Furthermore, as we focus resources on our growth strategies, we have reduced our investment in the development of our legacy systems that support our checks and forms businesses, with a focus on sustaining and maintaining such systems. These legacy systems operate with minimal or no vendor support, contain hardware and software that we are not able to update and are difficult to maintain, yet any interruption caused by a failure or breach of these systems could create disruption in the core businesses that generate a declining portion of our revenue. In addition, our technology, infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults that may cause our websites or operating systems to fail. Over the past two years, we shifted a substantial portion of our applications to a private cloud-based environment. While we maintain redundant systems and backup databases and applications software to ensure continuous access to cloud services, it is possible that access to our software capabilities could be interrupted and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims, all of which would adversely affect our reputation and operating results.\nIn addition, our continued development and implementation of new generation software solutions and information technology infrastructure may take longer than originally expected and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any inability to deploy new generation information technology throughout our organization would result in our operating multiple platforms, which would increase costs.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the success of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe have acquired over 25 companies in the last 3 years, the details of which appear under the caption \u201cNote 5: Acquisitions\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. We have invested in acquisitions that offer marketing solutions and other services and that extend the range of products and services we offer to financial institutions and small businesses, including treasury management and data-driven marketing solutions. In addition, over the past several years, we have purchased the operations of many small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our major accounts and dealer channels. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:\n\u2022\ndifficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations, products and services, including effectively scaling revenue and ensuring a strong system of information security and controls is in place;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize expected synergies and savings or to achieve projected profitability levels on a sustained basis;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns and risks of managing an increasingly diverse set of products and services across expanded and new industries;\n\u2022\nunanticipated integration costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies, especially when the acquired business was a non-public company and may not have employed the same rigor in these areas as required for a publicly traded company;\n\u2022\ndecisions by our customers or the customers of the acquired business to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in assimilating the acquired business into our corporate culture;\n\u2022\nfailure to address legacy distributor account protection rights;\n\u2022\nunidentified issues not discovered during our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and tax or legal contingencies; and\n\u2022\nloss of key employees.\nOne or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully operate, integrate or leverage an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe expect to continue to invest in acquisitions. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management\u2019s attention. We\ncannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. We may need to seek financing for larger acquisitions, which would increase our debt obligations and may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, significant acquisitions typically result in additional contingent liabilities and/or additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.\nThe success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to attract new and repeat customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is essential for the success of our service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. To promote our brand, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that our revenue will increase at a level commensurate with our marketing expenditures. There is also the risk that negative information about Deluxe, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. In early 2018, we entered into a partnership with television personality Ty Pennington, who will appear in our online series, Small Business Revolution - Main Street. Previously, we had a partnership with Robert Herjavec of the television show Shark Tank, and his episodes of the Small Business Revolution series remain available online. If our business partners are the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, such events could reduce the effectiveness of our partnerships, which in turn, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA component of our brand promotion strategy is establishing a relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. If we are unable to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason, our reputation may be harmed and our efforts to develop brand loyalty could be adversely impacted. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, adversely harming our business and results of operations.\nIf we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the nature of technology solutions used by small businesses and their customers may occur rapidly. In addition, the markets for many of the services provided by our Financial Services segment are characterized by constant technological changes. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services could make some or all of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. These potential changes are magnified by the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet these changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, our operating results could be adversely affected if we are required to incur substantial costs to keep pace with technological advances.\nIf third-party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.\nWe have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server, cloud computing and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services such as online payment solutions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional actions, electrical disruptions, or other conditions. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken reasonable steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a material disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense.\nAsset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations.\nGoodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name represented 52% of our total assets as of December 31, 2017. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of these assets is impaired. This analysis considers factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions. Circumstances that could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\na decline in our stock price for a sustained period;\n\u2022\na downturn in economic conditions that negatively affects our actual and forecasted operating results;\n\u2022\na material acceleration of order volume declines for our Direct Checks segment;\n\u2022\nthe failure of recent acquisitions to achieve expected operating results; or\n\u2022\nchanges in our business strategies.\nSuch situations may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and/or our indefinite-lived trade name. For example, during 2017, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $28.4 million related to our Small Business Services Safeguard reporting unit. The impairment analysis of this reporting unit, which incorporated the results of the annual strategic planning process, indicated lowered projected long-term revenue growth and profitability levels resulting from changes in market trends and the mix of products and services sold, including the continuing decline in checks and forms. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including amortizable intangibles and assets held for sale. If we were required to record additional asset impairment charges for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur variable-rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk and our credit facility matures in February 2019.\nBorrowings under our credit facility are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nOur credit facility matures in February 2019. As such, we will need to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise extend the maturity of our credit facility. Our ability to do so will be dependent on, among other things, business conditions, our financial performance and the general condition of the financial markets. If a financial disruption were to occur at the time that we are required to repay, refinance or replace indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility, we could be forced to undertake alternate financings under current market terms, negotiate for an extension of the maturity of the credit facility or sell assets and delay capital expenditures in order to generate proceeds that could be used to repay our indebtedness. We can provide no assurance that the terms of any new debt agreements will be as favorable as those under our current credit facility, which would negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nGovernmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. The cost of complying with these laws and regulations is significant. In addition, regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time, including triggering enforcement actions, or their interpretation of existing laws may change and/or differ from ours. These various regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations on our business activities, require changes to our business, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in our customers' purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly and/or less efficient and may require us to modify our current or future products, services, systems or processes. We cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such changes on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nPortions of our business operate within highly regulated industries and our business results could be significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject. For example, federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. Portions of our business are subject to regulations affecting payment processing, including ACH, remote deposit capture, and lockbox services. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement, and maintain certain policies and procedures related to payment processing. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses\u2019 customer information. These regulations and agreements typically limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed cyber security regulations may also increase the cost of compliance for the protection of nonpublic personal information. The complexity of compliance with these various regulations may increase our cost of doing business and may affect our financial institution clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, reducing their capacity to purchase our products and services.\nDue to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, search engine optimization, behavioral advertising and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as net neutrality, digital and social marketing, privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Changing data protection regulations may increase the cost of compliance in servicing international markets for our wholesale and retail business services channels. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions, \u201canti-spam\u201d regulations, or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites, and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.\nBecause of additional regulatory costs, financial institutions may put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, some financial institutions are wary of offering add-on services, such as bundled products, fraud/identity protection, expedited check delivery or rewards programs, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.\nWe are subject to environmental risks which, if realized, could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our printing facilities are subject to many federal, state and local regulations designed to protect the environment, including those related to air emissions, wastewater discharge, waste disposal, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties and, in some instances, have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. Unforeseen conditions at current or former facilities could result in additional liability and expense beyond our insurance coverage.\nSales and other tax collection requirements could have an adverse effect on our business. We currently collect sales, use and similar taxes in jurisdictions where our legal entities have a physical presence, in accordance with landmark decisions of the United States Supreme Court. States and local jurisdictions have begun enacting legislation requiring collection beyond our current practices. This potential increased cost to our customers may discourage them from purchasing our products and services, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if one or more state or local jurisdictions successfully asserts that we should have collected sales or other taxes in the past, but did not, we could incur a substantial liability for uncollected taxes. In addition, federal and state income tax laws and regulations are subject to change and could impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Federal tax reform legislation, which was enacted in December 2017 as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Act), resulted in a reduction in our 2017 income tax expense of approximately $20.5 million. We expect that our annual effective income tax rate for 2018 will be approximately 25% and we expect that our total tax payments in 2018 will be approximately $25.0 million less than in 2017, driven primarily by the 2017 Act.\nEconomic conditions could have an adverse effect on operating results in each of our business segments.\nEconomic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect consumer and business spending, including unemployment levels, the availability of credit, and small business confidence, as well as the financial condition and growth prospects of our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. As such, the level of small business confidence and the rate of small business formations and closures impact our business. We believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) publishes the results of monthly surveys that provide an indication of small business owners' view of economic conditions. The index of small business optimism published by the NFIB in December 2017 was 104.9, down slightly from 105.8 in December 2016. For 2017, the average index was 104.8, up significantly from the 96.3 average in 2016. At the same time, the net percent of small business owners expecting general business conditions to be better in 6 months declined to 37% in December 2017, as compared to 50% in December 2016. Although there continues to be some optimism from small business owners, including some belief that they will benefit from federal tax reform under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we cannot predict whether sustainable positive trends will translate into economic growth. Within our personal check printing businesses, consumer spending, employment levels, and housing stock and starts impact the number of checks consumers use. We estimate that the 2017 growth rates for consumer spending and private sector employment most likely had a neutral impact on our personal check businesses. An increase in housing stock and starts has a positive impact on the number of checks purchased, as new households typically are in need of new checks. According to statistics released by the United States Census Bureau in January 2018, housing units completed during 2017 increased almost 9% as compared to 2016. We cannot predict whether these economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.\nAs a result of global economic conditions in recent years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. This turmoil in the financial services industry affected and may continue to affect our results of operations. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover contract acquisition payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply and business services contracts. This results in providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the merger/acquisition. In addition, we are focused on targeting our FinTech solutions to larger financial institutions. The resulting customer concentration could increase our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments affecting our significant customers, including adverse economic conditions. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality selection of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.\nA deterioration in financial markets and/or in general business conditions in 2018 would negatively affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer.\nThe success of our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in our digital services businesses and specifically in sales, marketing, product management, data analytics and information technology. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and/or attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nThe cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, retail packaging supplies, promotional materials, other raw materials, delivery services and energy. Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by our paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers and these suppliers are under financial pressure as paper use declines. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur.\nWe depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for outsourced products and services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns or extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the United States Postal Service (USPS) and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services in the future. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Increased fuel costs can increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products and services. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products.\nThe failure to reduce costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nIntense competition, declines in the use of checks and business forms, the commoditization of web services, and sluggish economic conditions compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. We have significantly reduced costs over the past several years, primarily within sales, marketing, service fulfillment and operational support, as well as our shared services functions, including product fulfillment, information technology, real estate, finance and human resources. We realized net cost reductions of approximately $45.0 million in 2017, as compared to our 2016 results of operations, and we will continue to explore ways to simplify our business processes and reduce our cost and expense structure. Cost reduction initiatives have required and will continue to require up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business and, as a result, may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.\nWe could lose access to data sources which could harm our ability to provide certain of our products and services.\nWe rely upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data received from customers, strategic partners and various government and public record sources. This data includes credit and non-credit data from the national credit bureaus and other data brokers. Although we have not experienced material issues in this regard, our data sources could stop providing data, they could provide untimely data, or they could fail to adhere to our quality control standards, causing us to incur additional expense to appropriately utilize the data. In addition, our data sources could increase the costs of their data for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use, a perception that our systems are insecure, or for competitive reasons.\nIf a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw their services, if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation, if we were to lose exclusive right to the use of data, or if the collection of data were to become uneconomical, our ability to provide our products and services could be negatively impacted. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and integrate these data sources into our product and service offerings.\nThird-party claims could result in costly and distracting litigation, and in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business, including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices; claims alleging breach of contractual obligations; claims asserting deceptive, unfair or illegal business practices; or claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our business. The number and significance of these claims and proceedings has increased as our businesses have evolved and expanded in scope. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, or both. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimates of our probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution mechanisms. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to customer payment-related risks, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe accept payments for our products and services on our websites by a variety of methods, including credit and debit cards, checks and wire transfers. For debit and credit cards, we pay interchange and other fees that may increase over time. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and requirements, including Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. These rules and requirements have changed over time and could change in the future or be reinterpreted to make it more costly, more difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules and requirements, we may be subject to fines and/or higher transaction fees. Any changes could increase our cost of compliance, which would negatively affect our financial results. We could also lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers.\nIn addition, we may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers. While we do have safeguards in place, we cannot prevent all fraudulent transactions. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud. However, such transactions negatively impact our results of operations and could subject us to penalties from payment card associations for inadequate fraud protection.\nWe may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.\nA decline in the value of our postretirement medical plan assets and/or a significant increase in the number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nThe fair value of our postretirement medical plan assets is subject to various risks, including credit, interest and overall market volatility risk. If the equity markets were to experience a significant decline in value, the fair value of our plan assets would decrease. This would affect the funded status of our plan and result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable, future declines in the fair value of our plan assets could also result in the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.\nThe number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could increase significantly. For the 2018 plan year, 43.8% of those eligible to participate in our postretirement medical plan have elected not to participate. If a significant portion of those not participating were to opt-in to our plan, our benefit obligation would increase, which would result in increased expense. Although our plan is currently overfunded, a significant increase in plan participants could also require us to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.", "PERMNO": 61743, "SIC": 2780, "TIC": "DLX"}
