{"cik": "876343", "company": "BIOTIME INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks, including those described below. You should consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, which could materially adversely affect our proposed operations, our business prospects, and financial condition, and the value of an investment in our business. There may be other factors that are not mentioned here or of which we are not presently aware that could also affect our business operations and prospects. Those of our subsidiaries and other affiliates within BioTime that are developing therapeutic products derived from pluripotent stem cells will face substantially the same kind of risks that affect our business, as well as the risks related to our industry generally.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception and we do not know if we will attain profitability.\nOur total operating losses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $38.9, $59.0 million, and $65.8 million respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of $216.3 million, as of December 31, 2017. We primarily finance our operations through the sale of equity securities, research grants, licensing fees, royalties on product sales by our licensees, and subscription fees and advertising revenue from database products. Ultimately, our ability to generate sufficient operating revenue to earn a profit depends upon our success in developing and marketing or licensing our products, diagnostic tests, and technology. As a developer of therapeutic products derived from pluripotent stem cells, Asterias will face substantially the same kind of risks that affect our business, as well as the risks related to our industry generally.\nWe will spend a substantial amount of our capital on research and development but we might not succeed in developing products and technologies that are useful in medicine.\nWe are attempting to develop new medical products and technology. None of our experimental products and technologies has received regulatory approval for commercialization and have only been used in laboratory studies in vitro or in animals. These new products and technologies might not prove to be safe and efficacious in the human medical applications for which they are being developed. The experimentation we are doing is costly, time consuming, and uncertain as to its results. We incurred research and development expenses amounting to $24.0 million, $36.1 million and $42.6 million during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If we are successful in developing a new technology or products, refinement of the new technology or product and definition of the practical applications and limitations of the technology or product may take years and require the expenditure of large sums of money. Future clinical trials of new therapeutic products, particularly those products that are regulated as drugs or devices, will be very expensive and will take years to complete. We may not have the financial resources to fund clinical trials on our own and we may have to enter into licensing or collaborative arrangements with other companies. Any such arrangements may be dilutive to our ownership or economic interest in the products we develop, and we might have to accept royalty payments on the sale of products rather than receiving the gross revenues from product sales. In addition, we may discontinue one or more of the research or product development programs. Other programs slated for development including those we consolidate in a new subsidiary, AgeX Therapeutics, Inc., may be delayed or discontinued should adequate funding on acceptable terms not be available.\nThe amount and pace of research and development work that we and our subsidiaries can do or sponsor, and our ability to commence and complete clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval to market our therapeutic and medical device products, depends upon the amount of money we have.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $38.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities on hand, including $7.4 million held by AgeX. Although BioTime and subsidiaries combined have raised a total of approximately $55.0 million of net proceeds through the sale of equity securities in 2017, there can be no assurance that we or subsidiaries will be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all, or that any funds raised will be sufficient to permit us or our subsidiaries to develop and market our products and technology. Unless we and our subsidiaries are able to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional funds when needed, it is likely that we will be unable to continue our planned activities, even if we make progress in our research and development projects. We may have to postpone or limit the pace of our research and development work and planned clinical trials of our product candidates unless our cash resources increase through a growth in revenues or additional equity investment or borrowing.\nWe will need to issue additional equity or debt securities in order to raise additional capital needed to pay our operating expenses.\nWe and our subsidiaries and affiliates, including Asterias and OncoCyte, expect to continue to incur substantial research and product development expenses, and will need to raise additional capital to pay operating expenses until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from product sales, royalties and license fees. Our ability, and the ability of Asterias and OncoCyte, to raise additional equity or debt capital will depend, not only on progress made in developing new products and technologies, but also on access to capital and conditions in the capital markets. There can be no assurance that we, Asterias and OncoCyte will be able to raise capital on favorable terms or at times and in amounts needed to successfully finance product development, clinical trials, and general operations. Sales of additional equity securities by us or our subsidiaries could result in the dilution of the interests of shareholders or may otherwise limit our ability to finance further in the future, which may negatively impact our business and operations.\nIn addition to our own research and development expenses we may need to support to the research and development efforts of our affiliates if they are unable to independently raise sufficient capital\nWe have in the past supported the operations of our affiliates OncoCyte and Asterias while they were consolidated subsidiaries. We still own substantial equity interests in those companies, though less than a majority interest, and if either or both of those affiliates were unable to obtain sufficient funding to continue their respective operations we may agree to provide financial support to them in order to preserve or increase the value of the significant equity stakes we continue to hold. However, there is no assurance that we would elect to provide additional financing to our affiliates and if we determine not to do so our equity ownership may be diluted and value of the shares of our affiliates may decrease significantly.\nComprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government has recently enacted comprehensive tax legislation that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. This newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had federal and state gross net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $258 million. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, in varying amounts between 2018 and 2036. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the newly enacted federal income tax law, federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nFailure in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.\nOur ability to execute our business plan and maintain operations depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. IT systems are vulnerable to risks and damages from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our and our vendors\u2019 servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we lose the services of the key personnel upon whom we depend.\nWe believe that our continued success depends to a significant extent upon our efforts and ability to retain highly qualified personnel, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Dr. Michael West and Adi Mohanty. All of our officers and other employees are at-will employees, and therefore may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. The loss of the services of Dr. West, Mr. Mohanty or other members of senior management of BioTime or of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, the replacement of any of such individuals likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business and clinical objectives and would harm our business.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Our growth and entry into new products, technologies and markets will place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. Operating our business through subsidiaries, some of which are located in foreign countries, also adds to the complexity of our internal control over financial reporting and adds to the risk of a system failure, an undetected improper use or expenditure of funds or other resources by a subsidiary, or a failure to properly report a transaction or financial results of a subsidiary. We allocate certain expenses among BioTime itself and one or more of our subsidiaries, which creates a risk that the allocations we make may not accurately reflect the benefit of an expenditure or use of financial or other resources by BioTime as the parent company and the subsidiaries among which the allocations are made. An inaccurate allocation may impact our consolidated financial results, particularly in the case of subsidiaries that we do not wholly own since our financial statements include adjustments to reflect the minority ownership interests in our subsidiaries held by others.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or has not fully complied, with such laws, it could face substantial penalties.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates or technologies and begin commercializing those products or technologies in the United States, our operations may be subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, (\u201cHITECH\u201d) and our implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; and\n\u25cf state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payors, including commercial insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nIf we do not receive regulatory approvals we will not be permitted to sell our therapeutic and medical device products.\nThe therapeutic and medical device products that we and our subsidiaries develop cannot be sold until the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities approve the products for medical use. The need to obtain regulatory approval to market a new product means that:\n\u25cf We will have to conduct expensive and time-consuming clinical trials of new products. The full cost of conducting and completing clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approval of a new product cannot be presently determined, but could exceed our current financial resources.\n\u25cf Clinical trials and the regulatory approval process for a pharmaceutical or cell-based product can take several years to complete. As a result, we will incur the expense and delay inherent in seeking FDA and foreign regulatory approval of new products, even if the results of clinical trials are favorable.\n\u25cf Data obtained from preclinical and clinical studies is susceptible to varying interpretations and regulatory changes that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory agency approvals.\n\u25cf Because the therapeutic products we are developing with pluripotent stem cell technology involve the application of new technologies and approaches to medicine, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject those products to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologicals derived from other technologies.\n\u25cf A product that is approved may be subject to restrictions on use.\n\u25cf The FDA can recall or withdraw approval of a product, if it deems necessary.\n\u25cf We will face similar regulatory issues in foreign countries.\nGovernment-imposed bans or restrictions and religious, moral, and ethical concerns about the use of hES cells could prevent us from developing and successfully marketing stem cell products.\nGovernment-imposed bans or restrictions on the use of embryos or hES cells in research and development in the United States and abroad could generally constrain stem cell research, thereby limiting the market and demand for our products. During March 2009, President Obama lifted certain restrictions on federal funding of research involving the use of hES cells, and in accordance with President Obama\u2019s Executive Order, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has adopted new guidelines for determining the eligibility of hES cell lines for use in federally funded research. The central focus of the proposed guidelines is to assure that hES cells used in federally funded research were derived from human embryos that were created for reproductive purposes, were no longer needed for this purpose, and were voluntarily donated for research purposes with the informed written consent of the donors. The hES cells that were derived from embryos created for research purposes rather than reproductive purposes, and other hES cells that were not derived in compliance with the guidelines, are not eligible for use in federally funded research. California law requires that stem cell research be conducted under the oversight of a stem cell review oversight committee (SCRO). Many kinds of stem cell research, including the derivation of new hES cell lines, may only be conducted in California with the prior written approval of the SCRO. A SCRO could prohibit or impose restrictions on the research that we plan to do. The use of hES cells may give rise to religious, moral, and ethical issues. These considerations could lead to more restrictive government regulations or could generally constrain stem cell research, thereby limiting the market and demand for our products.\nThere is a risk that OncoCyte\u2019s planned diagnostic tests could become subject to FDA regulation\nWe cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including premarket review, will not be required in the future for OncoCyte\u2019s diagnostic tests, whether through additional guidance or regulations issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. If premarket review, including approval, is required, OncoCyte\u2019s business could be negatively affected until such review is completed and clearance to market or approval is obtained. If OncoCyte is selling diagnostic tests when new FDA approval requirements are implemented, OncoCyte may be required to suspend sales until premarket clearance or approval is obtained. If OncoCyte\u2019s diagnostic tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about the legal status of those tests.\nFDA regulations could also require, among other things, additional clinical studies and submission of a premarket notification or filing a PMA with the FDA. For example, LDTs with the same intended use as a cleared or approved companion diagnostic are defined in the FDA\u2019s draft guidance as \u201chigh-risk LDTs (Class III medical devices)\u201d for which premarket review would be required. This may include the use of LDTs for screening patients for cancer. If a PMA review is required by the FDA, there can be no assurance that OncoCyte\u2019s diagnostic tests will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, nor can there any be assurance that labeling claims allowed by the FDA will be consistent with OncoCyte\u2019s intended claims or will be sufficient to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for the tests.\nThe price and sale of our products and OncoCyte\u2019s diagnostic tests may be limited by health insurance coverage and government regulation.\nSuccess in selling our pharmaceutical and cell-based products, medical devices, and diagnostic tests may depend in part on the extent to which health insurance companies, HMOs, and government health administration authorities such as Medicare and Medicaid will pay for the cost of the products, tests, and related treatment. Until we introduce a new product or diagnostic test into the medical marketplace, we will not know with certainty whether adequate health insurance, HMO, and government coverage will be available to permit the product or test to be sold at a price high enough for us to generate a profit. In some foreign countries, pricing or profitability of health care products is subject to government control, which may result in low prices for our products. In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls, and new proposals are likely to be made in the future.\nWe expect that the commercial opportunity for some of our products may depend on our ability to obtain reimbursement and continued coverage from various payors, including government entities and insurance companies. Reimbursement Programs\nIf these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies or diagnostic tests, they may not cover our products or diagnostic tests as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nFor example, in the United States, healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs, as well as through private payers. Pharmacies are also reimbursed in a similar manner for drug products they dispense. We may be required to provide specified rebates or discounts on the products we sell to certain government funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and those rebates or discounts have increased over time. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, increased many of the mandatory discounts and rebates required of us and imposed a new Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers fee payable each year by us and other manufacturers. The new U.S. presidential administration has identified repealing and replacing the ACA as a priority. The timing and method of repeal of the ACA remains uncertain, but impending changes will likely impact the number of patient lives covered, the quality of the insurance and potentially the available reimbursement, Medicaid eligibility and the level of patient protections provided.\nWe face similar issues outside of the United States. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.\nThe ACA and future changes to that law may adversely affect our business.\nAs a result of the adoption of the ACA, in the United States, substantial changes have been made to the system for paying for healthcare in the United States. The changes contemplated by the ACA are subject to rule-making and implementation timelines that extend for several years, as well as initiatives in Congress to amend or repeal the law, and this uncertainty limits our ability to forecast changes that may occur in the future. Certain provisions related to cost-savings and reimbursement measures could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business.\nOur activities, and the activities of the BioTime Group, our collaborators, distributors and other third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions will directly regulate many of our most critical business activities, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting and product risk management. Our interactions in the U.S. or abroad with physicians and other health care providers that may prescribe or purchase our products are also subject to government regulation designed to prevent fraud and abuse in the sale and use of the products and place greater restrictions on the marketing practices of health care companies. Health care companies are facing heightened scrutiny of their relationships with health care providers from anti-corruption enforcement officials. In addition, health care companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of health care business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations or violations related to environmental matters. Risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations may be heightened as we bring products to the market globally.\nRegulations governing the health care industry are subject to change, with possibly retroactive effect, including:\n\u25cf new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, pricing or marketing practices, compliance with wage and hour laws and other employment practices, method of delivery, payment for health care products and services, compliance with health information and data privacy and security laws and regulations, tracking and reporting payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, extensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption prohibitions, product serialization and labeling requirements and used product take-back requirements;\n\u25cf changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;\n\u25cf requirements that provide for increased transparency of clinical trial results and quality data, such as the EMA\u2019s clinical transparency policy, which could impact our ability to protect trade secrets and competitively-sensitive information contained in approval applications or could be misinterpreted leading to reputational damage, misperception or legal action which could harm our business; and\n\u25cf changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products.\nViolations of governmental regulation may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions against us, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as against executives overseeing our business. In addition to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to repay amounts we received from government payors, or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the government. We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, collaborators, partners or third-party providers that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business.\nEven if we receive approval for our products, we may be subject to extensive regulatory obligations in order to commercialize our products.\nEven after initial FDA or foreign regulatory agency approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. Use of a product during testing and after marketing could reveal side effects that could delay, impede, or prevent marketing approval, result in a regulatory agency-ordered product recall, or in regulatory agency-imposed limitations on permissible uses or in withdrawal of approval. For example, if the FDA or foreign regulatory agency becomes aware of new safety information after approval of a product, it may require us to conduct further clinical trials to assess a known or potential serious risk and to assure that the benefit of the product outweigh the risks. If we are required to conduct such a post-approval study, periodic status reports must be submitted to the FDA or foreign regulatory agency. Failure to conduct such post-approval studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties. Data resulting from these clinical trials may result in expansions or restrictions to the labeled indications for which a product has already been approved. Any of these requirements or actions may negatively impact our business or operations.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted.\nAn entity that, among other things, is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, trading or holding certain types of securities would be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d). Based on the securities we hold, including our equity ownership in our publicly traded subsidiaries, we may not meet the requirements for an exemption promulgated under the 1940 Act and as a result we may be unable finance and subject to additional limitations on the operation of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Clinical Development and Commercial Operations\nClinical studies are costly, time consuming and are subject to risks that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future product candidates.\nWe cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of development. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf inability to generate satisfactory preclinical, toxicology, or other in vivo or in vitro data or diagnostics to support the initiation or continuation of clinical studies necessary for product approval;\n\u25cf delays in securing clinical investigators and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with CROs and clinical study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical study sites;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining required Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d), approval at each clinical study site;\n\u25cf failure to obtain permission from regulatory authorities to conduct a clinical study, after review of an investigational new drug (\u201cIND\u201d) or equivalent foreign application or amendment;\n\u25cf slower than anticipated rates of patient recruitment and enrollment, or failing to reach the targeted number of patients due to competition for patients from other trials;\n\u25cf failure by clinical sites or our CROs or other third parties to adhere to clinical study requirements or report complete findings;\n\u25cf failure to perform the clinical studies in accordance with the FDA\u2019s good clinical practices requirements, or applicable foreign regulatory guidelines;\n\u25cf patients dropping out of our clinical studies;\n\u25cf occurrence of adverse events associated with our product candidates;\n\u25cf negative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials which may result in our deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical studies or to curtail or abandon development programs for a product candidate;\n\u25cf unforeseen side effects, possibly resulting in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our product candidates;\n\u25cf approval and introduction of new therapies or changes in standards of practice or regulatory guidance that render our clinical trial endpoints or the targeting of our proposed indications obsolete;\n\u25cf inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment or problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols;\n\u25cf inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u25cf unavailability of clinical trial supplies\n\u25cf inability to use clinical trial results from foreign jurisdictions in support of U.S. regulatory approval;\n\u25cf changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u25cf the cost of clinical studies of our product candidates; and\n\u25cf delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with third-party manufacturers and the time for manufacture of sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical studies.\nAny inability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow competitors to develop and bring products to market before we do and may harm our business and results of operations.\nThe commercial success of any of our current or future product candidates will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nEven with the approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the commercial success of our products will depend in part on the health care providers, patients, and third-party payors accepting our product candidates as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe. Any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and other health care providers. The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including without limitation:\n\u25cf the efficacy of the product as demonstrated in clinical studies and potential advantages over competing treatments;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of the disease and any side effects;\n\u25cf the clinical indications for which approval is granted, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u25cf the convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf the cost of treatment, particular as additive to existing treatments;\n\u25cf the willingness of the patients and physicians to accept and use these therapies;\n\u25cf the marketing, sales and distribution support for the products;\n\u25cf the publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u25cf the pricing and availability of third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement.\nEven if a product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile upon approval, market acceptance of the product remains uncertain. Efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of the products may require significant investment and resources and may never be successful. If our products fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and other health care providers, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become or remain profitable.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, we may not meet our revenue expectations and, even assuming approval of a product candidate, our business may suffer.\nOur projections of both the number of potential users in the markets we are attempting to address are based on our beliefs and estimates. You should bear in mind the following:\n\u25cf Our estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including publications and scientific literature estimating the total number of patients, currently approved or used therapies, or market research as well as certain assumptions regarding the potential size of the market assuming broad regulatory approval or potential usage by physicians beyond the approved label, any of which may prove to be incorrect.\n\u25cf The scope of approval and potential use may be significantly narrower and the number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected.\n\u25cf Competitive agents or approaches may be approved or come into use by the relevant medical provider and the potentially addressable patient population for each of our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, any which could adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nSales of the products we may develop will be adversely impacted by the availability of competing products.\nOur products and product candidates will face substantial competition, whether through the development of safer and more effective alternatives to our products, lower costs to administer than our products or other forms of competition such as more favorable distribution, reimbursement and pricing or formulary and health care provider acceptance. For example, sales of Hextend\u00ae have been adversely impacted by the availability of other products that are commonly used in surgery and trauma care and sell at low prices. Ocata, which was recently acquired by a subsidiary of Astellas Pharma, Inc. for $379 million, is conducting clinical trials of a pluripotent stem cell product designed to treat AMD. If the Ocata product is proven to be safe and effective, it may be approved and reach the market ahead of OpRegen\u00ae. Moreover, Ocata was recently issued a patent in the U.S. with respect to the manufacture of RPE products that could adversely impact our rights to manufacture OpRegen\u00ae. In addition, even if our products are approved, physicians and hospitals may be reluctant to try a new product due to the high degree of risk associated with the application of new technologies and products in the field of human medicine.\nWe will face risks related to the manufacture of medical products for any product candidates that we develop.\nThe manufacture of medical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. We are developing manufacturing capability through Cell Cure for OpRegen\u00ae in Israel, but we will need to greater manufacturing capacity if we successfully commercialize those products. Unless we are able to raise the capital required to construct our own commercial scale manufacturing facilities, and are able to develop the expertise to manage and operate a manufacturing facility of our own, we may need to rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture any products that we develop. There is no assurance that we will be able to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all. Regardless of whether we do our own manufacturing or rely on third parties to manufacture products for us, we will face all risks related to the manufacture of therapeutic products for use in medicine including the following risks:\n\u25cf We or any third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely formulate and manufacture our products or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any.\n\u25cf We or any third-party manufacturers may not be able to execute our manufacturing procedures appropriately.\n\u25cf Any third-party manufacturers we engage may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products on a commercial scale.\n\u25cf We or any third-party manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We will not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with applicable regulations and standards.\n\u25cf We may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our product candidates.\n\u25cf Third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreements with us.\n\u25cf We or third-party manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments.\nIn addition, we may rely on third parties to perform release testing on our product candidates prior to delivery to patients. If these tests are not appropriately conducted and test data are not reliable, patients could be put at risk of serious harm which could result in product liability suits.\nIf we or any third-party manufacturers that we may engage were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide our product candidates to patients in clinical trials or to the medical market place would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, could require us to either commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely. Each of these risks could delay our clinical trials, any approval of our product candidates by the FDA, or the commercialization of our product candidates, and could result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenue.\nOur reliance on third parties to manufacture products, including Renevia\u00ae, will subject us to risks over which we may have little or no control, and which could lead to excessive product acquisition costs, production delays, and supply shortages that could impair our ability to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe do not currently have nor do we plan to acquire the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our clinical supplies for Renevia and our other HyStem\u00ae products on a clinical or commercial scale. In addition to the risks associated with manufacturing our products generally, discussed above, our reliance on third-party manufacturers for products, including Renevia\u00ae will expose us to the following additional risks:\n\u25cf We may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all.\n\u25cf Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely formulate and manufacture our products or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs.\n\u25cf Contract manufacturers may not be able to execute our manufacturing procedures appropriately.\n\u25cf Our future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products commercially.\n\u25cf Contract manufacturers could be forced to suspend the production of our products if their facilities and operating procedures fail to pass inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies conducted to assure compliance with their applicable regulations. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards.\n\u25cf We may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our product candidates.\n\u25cf We may not be able to obtain enabling licenses of third-party intellectual property rights needed by the manufacturers to produce our products.\n\u25cf Our third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreements with us.\nAdditionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to provide our product candidates to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenue. In addition, we rely on third parties to perform release testing on our product candidates prior to delivery to patients. If these tests are not appropriately conducted and test data are not reliable, patients could be put at risk of serious harm and could result in product liability suits.\nAny cell-based products that receive regulatory approval may be difficult and expensive to manufacture profitably.\nCell-based products are among the more expensive biological products to manufacture in accordance with cGMP. We do not yet have sufficient information to reliably estimate the cost of commercially manufacturing any of our product candidates. Excessive manufacturing costs could make our product candidates too expensive to compete in the medical market place with alternative products manufactured by our competitors, or might result in third party payors such as health insurers and Medicare, declining to cover our products or setting reimbursement levels too low for us to earn a profit from the commercialization of one or more of our products.\nWe face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use or misuse of our product candidates harm patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our product candidates, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.\nWe face the risk of incurring liabilities to clinical trial patients if they are injured as a result of their participation in our clinical trials. If any claims are made and if liability can be established, the amount of any liability that we or our affiliates may incur, could exceed any insurance coverage that is in effect, and the amount of the liability could be material to our financial condition.\nThe use or misuse of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. There is a risk that our product candidates may induce adverse events. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf impairment of our business reputation;\n\u25cf initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf costs due to related litigation;\n\u25cf distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; and\n\u25cf decreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.\nWe believe our current product liability insurance coverage is appropriate in light of our clinical programs; however, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If and when we obtain marketing approval for product candidates, we intend to increase our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur intellectual property may be insufficient to protect our products.\nOur patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of matter, formulations, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing, as appropriate. In addition to patenting our own technology and that of our subsidiaries, we and our subsidiaries have licensed patents and patent applications for certain stem cell technology, hEPC, and hES cell lines, diagnostic markers, hydrogel technology, and other technology from other companies.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our business could be negatively impacted by any of the following:\n\u25cf the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection, may not provide a basis for commercially viable products or may not provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u25cf our patents may be challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf others may have patents that relate to our technology or business that may prevent us from marketing our product candidates unless we are able to obtain a license to those patents;\n\u25cf the pending patent applications to which we have rights may not result in issued patents;\n\u25cf our patents may have terms that are inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products;\n\u25cf we may not be successful in developing additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nIn addition, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, duplicate any of our technologies and, if patents are licensed or issued to us, design around the patented technologies licensed to or developed by us. Moreover, we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we have to defend ourselves in patent lawsuits brought by third parties or if we initiate such lawsuits.\nIn Europe, there is uncertainty about the eligibility of hES cell subject matter for patent protection. The European Patent Convention prohibits the granting of European patents for inventions that concern \u201cuses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes.\u201d A recent decision at the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreted parthenogenetically produced hES cells as patentable subject matter. Consequently, the European Patent Office now recognizes that human pluripotent stem cells (including human ES cells) can be created without a destructive use of human embryos as of June 5, 2003, and patent applications relating to hES cell subject matter with a filing and priority date after that date are no longer automatically excluded from patentability under Article 53 (a) EPC and Rule 28(c) EPC.\nIn addition, the United States Supreme Court decisions in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics may limit OncoCyte\u2019s ability to obtain patent protection on diagnostic methods that merely recite a correlation between a naturally occurring event and a diagnostic outcome associated with that event.\nIf we are unable to obtain and enforce patents and to protect our trade secrets, others could use our technology to compete with us, which could limit opportunities for us to generate revenues by licensing our technology and selling products.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and maintain trade secrets in the United States and in other countries. If we are unsuccessful at obtaining and enforcing patents, our competitors could use our technology and create products that compete with our products, without paying license fees or royalties to us. The preparation, filing, and prosecution of patent applications can be costly and time consuming. Our limited financial resources may not permit us to pursue patent protection of all of our technology and products in all key markets. Even if we are able to obtain issued patents covering our technology or products, we may have to incur substantial legal fees and other expenses to enforce our patent rights to protect our technology and products from infringing uses. We may not have the financial resources to finance the litigation required to preserve our patent and trade secret rights. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. This means that patents owned or licensed by us may be lost if the outcome of a proceeding is unfavorable to us.\nThere is no certainty that our pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our products and processes in the U.S. and in other important markets remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts, administrative bodies and lawmakers in these countries. We can provide no assurance that we will successfully obtain or preserve patent protection for the technologies incorporated into our products and processes, or that the protection obtained will be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business. If we cannot prevent others from exploiting our inventions, we will not derive the benefit from them that we currently expect. Furthermore, we can provide no assurance that our products will not infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties.\nIn Europe, there is uncertainty about the eligibility of hES cell subject matter for patent protection. The European Patent Convention prohibits the granting of European patents for inventions that concern \u201cuses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes.\u201d A recent decision at the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreted parthenogenetically produced hES cells as patentable subject matter. Consequently, the European Patent Office now recognizes that human pluripotent stem cells (including human ES cells) can be created without a destructive use of human embryos as of June 5, 2003, and patent applications relating to hES cell subject matter with a filing and priority date after this date are no longer automatically excluded from patentability under Article 53 (a) EPC and Rule 28(c) EPC.\nIntellectual property we may develop using grants received from governments are subject to rights maintained by those governments.\nResearch and development we perform that is funded by grants from government, and any intellectual property that we create using those grants, is subject to certain rights of the government entities to require that we license or grant rights to the intellectual property developed using government funding in certain circumstances.\nThere is no certainty that we will be able to obtain licenses to intellectual property rights owned by third-parties.\nThere are no assurances that any of our intellectual property rights will guarantee protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates. In such cases, we may need to obtain enabling licenses from third parties to protect our products and product candidates, try to secure market exclusivity or avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties. If we are unable to fully protect our product candidates or achieve market exclusivity for our products and product candidates, our financial success will be dependent, in part, on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, or, when necessary, our ability to obtain enabling licenses.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends.\nOur business depends on several critical technologies that are based in part on technology licensed from third parties. Those third-party license agreements impose obligations on us, including payment obligations and obligations to pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents or technology. If a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement, the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights, which could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation and, potentially, a loss of the licensed rights. During the period of any such litigation, our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential products, and our ability to raise any capital that we might then need, could be significantly and negatively affected. If our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost, we would not be able to continue to use the licensed technology in our business.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nAsterias could lose its CIRM grant if Asterias fails to meet the clinical trial milestones that are a condition to CIRM\u2019s obligation to provide funding.\nAsterias depends on its grant from CIRM as a source of financing for the costs of conducting its Phase I/IIa clinical trial and process development of AST-OPC1. Under the terms of the CIRM grant, Asterias must meet certain efficacy and progress milestones pertaining to the clinical trial. If Asterias fails to meet any of the milestones within the specified time frame, CIRM may discontinue providing grant funds to Asterias, which could force Asterias to postpone, delay, or discontinue the clinical trial and development work for the product.\nWe may become dependent on possible future collaborations to develop and commercialize many of our product candidates and to provide the regulatory compliance, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities required for the success of our business.\nWe may enter into various kinds of collaborative research and development and product marketing agreements to develop and commercialize our products. The expected future milestone payments and cost reimbursements from collaboration agreements could provide an important source of financing for our research and development programs, thereby facilitating the application of our technology to the development and commercialization of our products, but there are risks associated with entering into collaboration arrangements.\nThere is a risk that we could become dependent upon one or more collaborative arrangements. A collaborative arrangement upon which we might depend might be terminated by our collaboration partner or a partner might determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of our products. A collaboration partner also may not be precluded from independently pursuing competing products and drug delivery approaches or technologies.\nThere is a risk that a collaboration partner might fail to perform its obligations under the collaborative arrangements or may be slow in performing its obligations. In addition, a collaboration partner may experience financial difficulties at any time that could prevent it from having available funds to contribute to the collaboration. If a collaboration partner fails to conduct its product development, commercialization, regulatory compliance, sales and marketing or distribution activities successfully and in a timely manner, or if it terminates or materially modifies its agreements with us, the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue such development and commercialization on our own.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nWe will need to rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, data management companies, contract clinical research associates, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct any clinical trials that we may undertake for our products. We may also rely on third parties to assist with our preclinical development of product candidates. If we outsource clinical trials we may be unable to directly control the timing, conduct and expense of our clinical trials. If we enlist third parties to conduct clinical trials and they fail to successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may need to rely on marketing partners or contract sales companies.\nIf we are able to develop our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals, we may choose to partner on one or more products for marketing, selling or distributing our products. If we do not partner for commercial services, we and our subsidiaries will be dependent on our ability to build our own marketing and distribution capability for our new products, which would require the investment of significant financial and management resources, or we will need to find collaborative marketing partners or sales representatives, or wholesale distributors for the commercial sale of our products.\nIf we market products through arrangements with third parties, we may pay sales commissions to sales representatives or we may sell or consign products to distributors at wholesale prices. As a result, our gross profit from product sales may be lower than it would be if we were to sell our products directly to end users at retail prices through our own sales force. There can be no assurance we will able to negotiate distribution or sales agreements with third parties on favorable terms to justify our investment in our products or achieve sufficient revenues to support our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Affiliates\nDelays in the successful completion of the clinical validation study and commercialization of DetermaVu\u2122 would negatively affect OncoCyte\u2019s business operations.\nOncoCyte is experiencing a delay in conducting the clinical validation study of its confirmatory lung cancer diagnostic text DetermaVu\u2122. During the process of running initial blood samples for the DetermaVu\u2122 clinical validation study, inconsistent analytic results were observed. OncoCyte believes that the cause was a variance in a recently received lot of consumables used in the processing equipment that analyzes blood samples. OncoCyte anticipates that completion of the clinical validation study necessary for the commercial launch of DetermaVu\u2122 will be delayed into the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to the successful rectification of the cause of the inconsistent analytic results. Clinical validation studies can fail for a variety of reasons. Accordingly, a resolution of the issue that caused the inconsistent analytic results that was observed will not necessarily assure a successful outcome of the clinical validation study of DetermaVu\u2122.\nIt is not yet known whether OncoCyte will be able to resolve the issue that has caused the delay in the clinical validation study or whether a successful resolution will result in additional costs to OncoCyte, other than a loss of productivity during the period of the delay. There is a risk that OncoCyte could incur additional quality control and analytic platform related costs on an ongoing basis in conducting DetermaVu\u2122 tests if the issue is resolved and the test is commercialized. OncoCyte is also considering changing analytic platforms, which would entail the incurrence of additional cost and delay in acquiring the new analytic equipment and reagents from a different manufacturer, training OncoCyte personnel in the use of the new platform, and re-testing clinical blood samples to validate or adjust the algorithm and to validate, if feasible, the past results of OncoCyte\u2019s previous research and development studies before undertaking the clinical validation study on the new platform. There is no assurance that OncoCyte will be able to replicate its past research and development study results on a new analytic platform, or that if those results are replicated that the results of its clinical validation study will support commercialization of DetermaVu\u2122.\nDelays in the successful completion of the clinical validation study and commercialization of DetermaVu\u2122 could prevent OncoCyte from raising, when needed, sufficient additional capital to finance its operations, including completion of development and commercial launch of DetermaVu\u2122 or the other cancer diagnostic tests that it is developing.\nThe FDA may impose additional regulations for laboratory developed tests such as the ones OncoCyte is developing.\nThe FDA issued two draft guidance documents and a discussion paper that set forth a proposed risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs such as those OncoCyte is developing. If the FDA implements the new regulatory measures set forth in these documents:\n\u25cf OncoCyte may be required to obtain pre-market clearance or approval before selling its diagnostic tests;\n\u25cf As a result of required FDA pre-market review, OncoCyte\u2019s tests may not be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u25cf FDA labeling requirements may limit OncoCyte\u2019s claims about its diagnostic tests, which may have a negative effect on orders from physicians;\n\u25cf The regulatory approval process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and making a 510(k) submission, or filing a pre-market approval application with the FDA; and,\n\u25cf If regulatory actions affect any of the reagents OncoCyte obtain from suppliers and use in conducting its tests, its business could be adversely affected in the form of increased costs of testing or delays, limits or prohibitions on the purchase of reagents necessary to perform its testing.\nOncoCyte will depend on Medicare and a limited number of private payers for a significant portion of its revenues, and its revenues could decline if these payers fail to provide timely and adequate payment for its diagnostic tests.\nOncoCyte expects that a substantial portion of the patients for whom it will perform diagnostic tests will have Medicare as their primary medical insurance. Even if OncoCyte\u2019s planned tests are otherwise successful, reimbursement for the Medicare-covered portions of its planned tests might not, without Medicare reimbursement, produce sufficient revenues to enable it to reach profitability and achieve its other commercial objectives. It generally takes two to three years to obtain Medicare coverage and other third party reimbursement approvals for a new LDT and there can be no assurance OncoCyte will obtain such approvals for any of the cancer diagnostics that it is developing. Until a new cancer diagnostic test is accepted by third party payers for reimbursement, OncoCyte will have to market the test to physicians on a patient pay basis. In the absence of reimbursement by Medicare, patients who would be candidates for the use of OncoCyte\u2019s diagnostic tests and who rely on Medicare coverage may decline to use those tests, and physicians may be reluctant to prescribe the tests, due to the cost of the test to the patients. Because of this patient cost factor, revenues from any new cancer test that OncoCyte markets will experience slow growth until the test is approved for reimbursement in an amount commensurate with the cost to the patient.\nMedicare and other third-party payers may change their coverage policies or cancel future contracts with OncoCyte at any time; review and adjust the rate of reimbursement; or stop paying for OncoCyte\u2019s tests altogether, which would reduce OncoCyte\u2019s total revenues. Payers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization, and delivery of health care services, and have undertaken measures to reduce payment rates for and decrease utilization of clinical laboratory testing. Because of the cost-trimming trends, any third-party payers that will cover and provide reimbursement for diagnostic tests may suspend, revoke or discontinue coverage at any time, or may reduce the reimbursement rates payable to OncoCyte. Any such action could have a negative impact on OncoCyte\u2019s revenues, which may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in healthcare laws and policies may have a material adverse effect on OncoCyte\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ACA substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the ACA\u2019s key changes, the ACA reduced payment rates under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and established an Independent Payment Advisory Board to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if spending exceeds a target growth rate. Such provisions may negatively impact payment rates for OncoCyte\u2019s diagnostic tests. The new U.S. presidential administration has identified repealing and replacing the ACA as a priority. On March 6, 2017, the American Health Care Act (\u201cAHCA\u201d) was introduced as the new administration\u2019s proposed replacement of ACA. The timing and method of repeal of ACA and adoption of the AHCA remains uncertain, but impending changes will likely impact the number of patient lives covered, the quality of the insurance, Medicaid eligibility and the level of patient protections provide.\nThe Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (\u201cPAMA\u201d) significantly altered the payment methodology under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule that determines Medicare coverage for laboratory tests. Under PAMA, clinical laboratories are required to report test payment data for each Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic lab test and beginning in 2017, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test will be equal to the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period.\nCongress has proposed on several occasions to impose a 20% coinsurance payment requirement on patients for clinical laboratory tests reimbursed under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, which would require OncoCyte to bill patients for these amounts. In the event that Congress were to ever enact such legislation, the cost of billing and collecting for OncoCyte\u2019s tests could often exceed the amount actually received from the patient.\nBeginning January 1, 2017, Medicare payment for any new advanced diagnostic test will be based on the list price or charge. After the test is commercially available for three quarters, the laboratory will be required to report payment and volume information and that data will be used to set payment for the test for the following year.\n\u25cf If data shows that the list price was greater than 130% of the payment using established methodology (a weighted median), CMS will recoup the difference from the laboratory through a payment claw back.\n\u25cf Payment will be updated annually based on the weighted median of commercial payer reimbursement.\nWe cannot predict whether future health care initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or how any future legislation or regulation may affect OncoCyte. The expansion of government\u2019s role in the U.S. health care industry as a result of the ACA, and changes to the reimbursement amounts paid by Medicare and other payers for diagnostic tests may have a materially adverse effect on OncoCyte\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause of certain Medicare billing policies, OncoCyte may not receive complete reimbursement for tests provided to Medicare patients.\nMedicare has coverage policies that can be national or regional in scope. Coverage means that the test or assay is approved as a benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. If there is no coverage, neither the supplier nor any other party, such as a diagnostic laboratory, may receive reimbursement from Medicare for the service. Regional policies are directed by Medicare\u2019s regional Medicare Administrative Contractors (\u201cMACs\u201d). Reimbursement for diagnostic testing may be negatively impacted by California MAC policies.\nLong payment cycles of Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors, or other payment delays, could hurt OncoCyte\u2019s cash flows and increase its need for working capital.\nMedicare and Medicaid have complex billing and documentation requirements that OncoCyte will have to satisfy in order to receive payment. Failure to comply with these requirements and other laws applicable to billing may result in, among other things, non-payment, refunds, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal liabilities, any of which may have a material adverse effect on OncoCyte\u2019s revenues and earnings. Similarly, the failure of private health insurers or other private third-party payers to properly process OncoCyte\u2019s payment claims in a timely manner could delay its receipt of payment for its diagnostic tests and services, which may have a material adverse effect on its cash flows.\nPrivate health insurance company policies may deny coverage or limit the amount they will reimburse OncoCyte for the performance of its diagnostic tests.\nPatients who are not covered by Medicare will generally rely on health insurance provided by private health insurance companies. If OncoCyte is considered a \u201cnon-contracted provider\u201d by a third-party payer, that payer may not reimburse patients for diagnostic tests performed by OncoCyte or doctors within the payer\u2019s network of covered physicians may not use its services to perform diagnostic tests for their patients. As a result, OncoCyte may need to enter into contracts with health insurance companies or other private payers to provide diagnostic tests to their insured patients at specified rates of reimbursement which may be lower than the rates OncoCyte might otherwise collect.\nRisks Pertaining to Our Common Shares\nThe market price of our common shares may be impacted if we spinoff AgeX.\nOur Board of Directors has initiated plans for BioTime to distribute to our shareholders, on a pro rata basis, all or a portion of the AgeX common stock we hold. We expect that after the distribution the AgeX shares will be publicly traded but we cannot assure that a public market for AgeX shares will develop or be sustained or that the prices at which the AgeX shares may trade will reflect the actual value of AgeX\u2019s business, assets, and prospects. If the distribution is completed, the market price of BioTime common shares should decline by an amount that reflects the market value of the AgeX shares distributed, but it is not possible to predict the actual market value of AgeX shares or the exact amount of the initial reduction in the BioTime share price, and it is possible that the change in price might be greater than the price at which the AgeX shares received by our shareholders in the distribution will trade in the public market. Accordingly, there is a risk that if the distribution is effected, after the distribution the combined market value of BioTime shareholders\u2019 BioTime common shares and the AgeX common stock the shareholders receive in the distribution could be less than the market value of the BioTime common shares immediately before the distribution.\nFurther, if the distribution of AgeX shares occurs before the October 1, 2018 expiration date of our outstanding, publicly traded, common share purchase warrants, we will be required by the warrant agreement to reduce the exercise price of the warrants and increase the number of shares that may be purchased through the exercise of the warrants based on the fair market value of the distributed AgeX shares as determined by our Board of Directors. The impact of those adjustments could have a dilutive effect on the interests of holders of our common shares, depending on the value of the AgeX shares and the relationship between the reduced exercise price of the warrants and the prices at which our common shares trade after the exercise price reduction.\nThe implementation of a new FASB accounting standard could increase the risk that our future consolidated financial statements could be qualified by going concern uncertainty.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d ASU No. 2014-15 defines management\u2019s responsibility to assess an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU No. 2014-15 was effective for us for the year ended December 31, 2016, and all annual and interim periods thereafter. In connection with preparing consolidated financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, ASU No. 2014-15 requires that an entity\u2019s management evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). As a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2014-15, we will be required to have more cash, cash equivalents, and liquid investments on hand on the date we issue or file our consolidated financial statements than had been the case during prior years in order to avoid a going concern qualification in our auditor\u2019s report and in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements. If our consolidated financial statements were to become subject to a going concern qualification or uncertainty or if we are unable to alleviate substantial doubt as part of our going concern assessment, or both, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nAsterias and OncoCyte are also be impacted by ASU No. 2014-15 in much the same manner as us. If the financial statements of Asterias, or OncoCyte, or both, were to become subject to a going concern qualification or uncertainty, the market price of their common stock could decline, resulting in a loss or decline in value of the Asterias shares we own, the OncoCyte shares we own, or both, as equity method investments at fair value.\nOur net income or loss will be impacted by changes in the market value of Asterias and OncoCyte common stock.\nBecause we use the equity method of accounting for the common stock of Asterias and OncoCyte that we hold at fair value, we will recognize gain or loss to the extent that the market value of Asterias and OncoCyte common stock changes from calendar quarter to calendar quarter, regardless of whether we sell any of those shares.\nBecause we are engaged in the development of pharmaceutical and stem cell therapy products and cancer diagnostic tests, the price of our common shares may rise and fall rapidly.\n\u25cf The market price of our common shares, like that of the shares of many biotechnology companies, has been highly volatile.\n\u25cf The price of our common shares may rise rapidly in response to certain events, such as the commencement of clinical trials of an experimental new therapy or diagnostic test, even though the outcome of those trials and the likelihood of ultimate FDA approval of a therapeutic product remain uncertain.\n\u25cf Similarly, prices of our common shares may fall rapidly in response to certain events such as unfavorable results of clinical trials or a delay or failure to obtain FDA approval.\n\u25cf The failure of our earnings to meet analysts\u2019 expectations could result in a significant rapid decline in the market price of our common shares.\nCurrent economic and stock market conditions may adversely affect the price of our common shares.\nThe stock market has been experiencing extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of the equity securities without regard to the operating performance of the issuing companies. Broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic and political conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nBecause we do not pay dividends, our common shares may not be a suitable investment for anyone who needs to earn dividend income.\nWe do not pay cash dividends on our common shares. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that any earnings generated in our business will be used to finance the growth of our business and will not be paid out as dividends to holders of our common shares. This means that our common shares may not be a suitable investment for anyone who needs to earn income from their investments.\nInsiders continue to have substantial control over our company, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur directors, executive officers and each of our shareholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, owned approximately 31% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2017. As a result, these shareholders, if acting together, will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deter certain public investors from purchasing our common stock and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common shares and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our common shares.\nThe trading market for our common shares will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about our business and our common shares. We do not have any control over these analysts. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our common shares. If securities analysts do not cover our common shares, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of those shares. If securities analysts do cover our common shares, they could issue reports or recommendations that are unfavorable to the price of our common shares, and they could downgrade a previously favorable report or recommendation, and in either case our share prices could decline as a result of the report. If one or more of these analysts does not initiate coverage, ceases to cover our common shares or fails to publish regular reports on our business, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share prices or trading volume to decline.\nIf we or our subsidiaries issue additional common shares or preferred shares, investors in our common shares may experience dilution of their ownership interests.\nWe and our subsidiaries may issue additional common shares or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common shares in order to raise additional capital, or in connection with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, or in connection with future acquisitions of licenses to technology or rights to acquire products, or in connection with future business acquisitions, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional common shares or other securities may be dilutive to our current shareholders and may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common shares.\nWe plan to ask our shareholders approve an increase in the number of our authorized shares to make available for issues a sufficient number of additional shares to meet our financing needs. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 152,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 150,000,000 common shares and 2,000,000 \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares. As of December 31, 2017, there were 126,865,634 issued and outstanding common shares, 8,043,229 common shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options under our employee stock option plans; 62,500 common shares reserved for issuance upon the lapse of restricted stock units (RSUs) under our Equity Incentive Plan; and 9,394,862 shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of common share purchase warrants, including the publicly traded warrants.\nThe operation of some of our subsidiaries has been financed in part through the sale of capital stock in those subsidiaries to private investors. Sales of additional subsidiary shares could reduce our ownership interest in the subsidiaries, and correspondingly dilute our shareholder\u2019s ownership interests in our consolidated enterprise. Our subsidiaries also have their own stock option plans and the exercise of subsidiary stock options or the sale of restricted stock under those plans would also reduce our ownership interest in the subsidiaries, with a resulting dilutive effect on the ownership interest of our shareholders in our consolidated enterprise.\nWe may also issue preferred shares having rights, preferences, and privileges senior to the rights of our common shares with respect to dividends, rights to share in distributions of our assets if we liquidate our company, or voting rights. Any preferred shares may also be convertible into common shares on terms that would be dilutive to holders of common shares. Our subsidiaries may also issue their own preferred shares with a similar dilutive impact on our ownership of the subsidiaries.\nThe market price of our common shares could be impacted by prices at which we sell shares in our subsidiaries.\nThe operation of some our subsidiaries has been financed in part through the sale of capital stock in those subsidiaries, and our subsidiaries may sell shares of their capital stock in the future for financing purposes. The prices at which our subsidiaries may sell shares of their capital stock could impact the value of our company as a whole and could impact the price at which our common shares trade in the market. A sale of capital stock of one of our subsidiaries at a price that the market perceives as low could adversely impact the market price of our common shares. Even if our subsidiaries sell their capital stock at prices that reflect arm\u2019s length negotiation with investors, there is no assurance that those prices will reflect a true fair market value or that the ascribed value of the subsidiaries based on those share prices will be fully reflected in the market value of our common shares.", "PERMNO": 77393, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "LCTX"}
