While the cycles of each industry do not necessarily coincide, demand and prices in each may drop substantially during the same period. Real estate development of residential lots is further influenced by new home construction activity, which has been volatile in recent years. Oil and gas may be further influenced by national and international commodity prices, principally for oil and gas. Cyclical downturns may materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. All of our operations are impacted by both national and global economic conditions.\nThe real estate, oil and gas and natural resource industries are highly competitive and a number of entities with which we compete are larger and have greater resources, and competitive conditions may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe real estate, oil and gas, and natural resources industries in which we operate are highly competitive and are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, new housing starts, home repair and remodeling activities, credit availability, consumer confidence, unemployment, housing affordability, changes in oil and gas prices, and federal energy policies.\nThe competitive conditions in the real estate industry may result in difficulties acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices, lower sales volumes and prices, increased development or construction costs and delays in construction and leasing. We compete with numerous regional and local developers for the acquisition, entitlement, and development of land suitable for development. We also compete with national, regional and local home builders who develop real estate for their own use in homebuilding operations, many of which are larger and have greater resources, including greater marketing budgets. Any improvement in the cost structure or service of our competitors will increase the competition we face.\nWe face intense competition from both major and independent oil and gas companies. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours, and some of them are fully integrated oil and gas companies. These companies also may have greater geologic or other technical expertise than we do.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected by any of these factors.\nWe may be unable to successfully divest our non-core assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have announced that we are focused on our core residential housing business, and that we intend to exit non-core, non-residential housing assets. The sale of non-core real estate assets may be impacted by market conditions outside of our control, such as capitalization rates, anticipated market demand and job growth, property location and other existing or anticipated competitive properties, interest rates, availability of financing, and other factors that we do not control. Additionally, the sale of non-core oil and gas assets may be impacted by oil and gas commodity prices, demand for similar assets, extraction costs, regulatory environment, and other factors that we do not control. Our ability to divest non-core assets, the timing for such divestments, and the prices we may ultimately receive may be impacted by the foregoing or other factors.\nOur activities are subject to environmental regulations and liabilities that could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. Compliance with these provisions or the promulgation of new environmental laws and regulations may result in delays, may cause us to invest substantial funds to ensure compliance with applicable environmental regulations and can prohibit or severely restrict timber harvesting, real estate development or mineral production activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.\nSignificant reductions in cash flow from slowing real estate, oil and gas or other natural resources market conditions could lead to higher levels of indebtedness, limiting our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe must comply with various covenants contained in our senior secured credit facility, the indentures governing our 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 (Convertible Notes), 4.50% senior amortizing notes due 2016 (Senior Amortizing Notes), 8.50% senior secured notes due 2022 (Senior Secured Notes) and any other existing or future debt arrangements. Significant reductions in cash flow from slowing real estate, oil and gas or other natural resources market conditions could require us to increase borrowing levels under our senior secured credit facility or to borrow under other debt arrangements and lead to higher levels of indebtedness, limiting our financial and operating flexibility, and ultimately limiting our ability to comply with our debt covenants, including the maintenance covenants under our senior secured credit facility. Realization of any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictive covenants under our senior secured credit facility and indentures governing our 3.75% convertible senior notes, 4.50% senior amortizing notes and 8.50% senior secured notes may limit the manner in which we operate.\nOur senior secured credit facility and indentures covering our Convertible Notes, Senior Amortizing Notes and Senior Secured Notes contain various covenants and conditions that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nincur restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nDebt within some of our ventures may not be renewed or may be difficult or more expensive to replace.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our unconsolidated ventures had approximately $134.7 million of debt, of which $28.3 million was non-recourse to us. When debt within our ventures matures, some of our ventures may be unable to renew existing loans or secure replacement financing, or replacement financing may be more expensive. If our ventures are unable to renew existing loans or secure replacement financing, we may be required to contribute additional equity or elect to loan or contribute funds to our ventures, which could increase our risk or increase our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, or both. If our ventures secure replacement financing that is more expensive, our profits may be reduced.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $390 million of consolidated debt outstanding. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance current or future debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot be certain that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face could intensify.\nOur business may suffer if we lose key personnel.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in our business segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled personnel in each of our business segments.\nIn addition, we have determined that certain of our assets are not part of our core residential housing business. We have retained advisors to sell a hotel in Austin and to market non-core oil and gas assets. Although we have implemented compensation arrangements designed to retain key personnel associated with operating non-core assets, we may be unable to retain all such personnel until all non-core assets have been divested.\nRisks Related to our Real Estate Operations\nReduced demand for new housing or commercial tracts in the markets where we operate could adversely impact our profitability.\nThe residential development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions, such as employment levels, availability of financing for home buyers, interest rates, consumer confidence and housing demand. Adverse changes in these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand for lots for new homes in these areas. Decline in housing demand could negatively affect our real estate development activities, which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings.\nFurthermore, the market value of undeveloped land and lots held by us, including commercial tracts, can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and real estate market conditions. If there are significant adverse changes in economic or real estate market conditions, we may have to hold land in inventory longer than planned. Inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or lower returns and adversely affect our liquidity.\nDevelopment of real estate entails a lengthy, uncertain and costly entitlement process.\nApproval to develop real property entails an extensive entitlement process involving multiple and overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and often requiring discretionary action by local governments. This process is often political, uncertain and may require significant exactions in order to secure approvals. Real estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. The process to comply with these regulations is usually lengthy and costly, may not result in the approvals we seek, and can be expected to materially affect our real estate development activities, which may adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur real estate development operations are currently concentrated in the major markets of Texas, and a significant portion of our undeveloped land holdings are concentrated in Georgia. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and strength of those areas.\nThe economic growth and strength of Texas, where the majority of our real estate development activity is located, are important factors in sustaining demand for our real estate development activities. The recent sharp decline in oil prices may impact near-term job growth and housing demand in Texas, particularly in Houston, where the energy industry has generated significant job growth over the past several years. Further, the future economic growth and real estate development opportunities in broad area around Atlanta, Georgia may be adversely affected if its infrastructure, such as roads, utilities, and schools, are not improved to meet increased demand. There can be no assurance that these improvements will occur. As a result, any adverse impact to the economic growth and health, or infrastructure development, of those areas could materially adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur real estate development operations are highly dependent upon national, regional and local home builders.\nWe are highly dependent upon our relationships with national, regional, and local home builders to purchase lots in our residential developments. If home builders do not view our developments as desirable locations for homebuilding operations, or if home builders are limited in their ability to conduct operations due to economic conditions, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we enter into contracts to sell lots to home builders. A home builder could decide to delay purchases of lots in one or more of our developments due to adverse real estate conditions wholly unrelated to our areas of operations, such as the corporate decisions regarding allocation of limited capital or human resources. As a result, we may sell fewer lots and may have lower sales revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategic partners may have interests that differ from ours and may take actions that adversely affect us.\nWe enter into strategic alliances or venture relationships as part of our overall strategy for particular developments or regions. While these partners may bring development experience, industry expertise, financing capabilities, local credibility or other competitive attributes, they may also have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors unrelated to our business. We may also be subject to adverse business consequences if the market reputation or financial condition of a partner deteriorates, or if a partner takes actions inconsistent with our interest.\nWhen we enter into a venture, we may rely on our venture partner to fund its share of capital commitments to the venture and to otherwise fulfill its operating and financial obligations. Failure of a venture partner to timely satisfy its funding or other obligations to the venture could require us to elect whether to increase our financial or other operating support of the venture in order to preserve our investment, which may reduce our returns or cause us to incur losses, or to not fund such obligations, which may subject the venture and us to adverse consequences or increase our financial exposure in the project.\nDelays or failures by governmental authorities to take expected actions could reduce our returns or cause us to incur losses on certain real estate development projects.\nFor certain projects, we rely on governmental utility and special improvement districts (SID) to issue bonds to reimburse us for qualified expenses, such as road and utility infrastructure costs. Bonds must be supported by district tax revenues, usually from ad valorem taxes. Slowing new home sales, decreasing real estate prices or difficult credit markets for bond sales can reduce or delay district bond sale revenues, causing such districts to delay reimbursement of our qualified expenses. Failure to receive timely reimbursement for qualified expenses could adversely affect our cash flows and reduce our returns or cause us to incur losses on certain real estate development projects.\nDevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability.\nWe may develop and construct single family or multifamily communities as wholly-owned projects or through ventures with unaffiliated parties. Our development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:\n\u2022\nwe may incur construction costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials, labor or other costs or unforeseen environmental or other conditions, which could make completion of the property uneconomical, and we may not be able to increase rents or sales to compensate for the increase in construction costs;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to complete construction and/or lease-up of a community on schedule and meet financial goals for development projects;\n\u2022\nan adverse incident during construction or development could adversely affect our ability to complete construction, conduct operations or cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment, pollution or other environmental contamination, regulatory penalties, suspension of operations, and attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation; and\n\u2022\nbecause occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, we may be unable to meet our profitability goals for that community.\nPossible difficulty of selling multifamily communities could limit our operational and financial flexibility.\nPurchasers may not be willing to pay acceptable prices for multifamily communities that we wish to sell. If we are unable to sell multifamily communities or if we can only sell multifamily communities at prices lower than are generally acceptable, then we may receive lower returns than expected or may have to take on additional leverage in order to provide adequate capital to execute our business strategy.\nIncreased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit our ability to retain residents, lease apartments or increase or maintain rents.\nOur multifamily communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other multifamily communities and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes. Competitive housing could adversely affect our ability to retain residents, lease apartments and increase or maintain rents.\nFailure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth.\nWe may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. Our historical experience in existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets. We may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets, including, among others:\n\u2022\nan inability to accurately evaluate local housing market conditions and local economies;\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nan inability to hire and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\nan inability to successfully integrate operations; and\n\u2022\nlack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures.\nRisks Related to our Oil and Gas Operations\nVolatile oil and gas prices could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur cash flows and results of operations are dependent in part on oil and gas prices, which are volatile. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices averaged $48.66 per Bbl in 2015, nearly 48 percent lower than in 2014 due to growth in global oil inventories and weakening global demand, particularly in Asia. There is a risk that commodity prices could remain depressed for sustained periods. We can be impacted by short-term changes in commodity prices. Oil and gas prices also\nimpact the amounts we receive for selling and renewing our mineral leases. Moreover, oil and gas prices depend on factors we cannot control, such as: changes in foreign and domestic supply and demand for oil and gas; actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC); weather; political conditions in other oil-producing countries, including the possibility of insurgency or war in such areas; prices of foreign exports; domestic and international drilling activity; price and availability of alternate fuel sources; the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies; the level and effect of trading in commodity markets; the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and governmental regulations. Any substantial or extended decline in the price of oil and gas could have a negative impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to the numerous risks of oil and gas drilling and production activities.\nOil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include the risk of fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards. Environmental hazards include oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures, discharges of toxic gases, underground migration and surface spills or mishandling of any toxic fracture fluids, including chemical additives. In addition, title problems, weather conditions and mechanical difficulties or shortages or delays in delivery of drilling rigs and other equipment could negatively affect our operations. If any of these or other similar industry operating risks occur, we could have substantial losses. Substantial losses also may result from injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, clean-up responsibilities, environmental damage, regulatory investigation, enforcement actions and penalties, and restriction or suspension of operations. In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities. Also, we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex involving decisions and assumptions in evaluating the available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. Accordingly, these estimates are imprecise. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves might vary from those estimated. Any variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of proved reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Such adjustments could negatively impact our ability to obtain financing.\nThe estimates of our reserves as of December 31, 2015 are based upon various assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be correct over time. In particular, estimates of oil and gas reserves, future net revenue from proved reserves and the standardized measure thereof for our oil and gas interests are based on the assumption that future oil and gas prices remain the same as the twelve month first-day-of-the-month average oil and gas prices for the year ended December 31, 2015. The average realized sales prices as of such date used for purposes of such estimates were $2.59 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas and $50.28 per barrel of oil. The December 31, 2015 estimates also assume that the working interest owners will make future capital expenditures which are necessary to develop and realize the value of proved reserves.\nThe standardized measure of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated reserves.\nAny material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. As required by SEC regulations, we base our present value of estimated future oil and gas revenues on prices and costs in effect at the time of the estimate. However, actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by numerous factors not subject to our control and will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\ndecisions and activities of the well operators;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for oil and gas;\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for oil and gas;\n\u2022\nactual operating costs;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of production will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow, which is required\nby the SEC, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nHydraulic fracturing, the process used for extracting oil and gas from shale and other formations, and other subsurface injections have come under increased scrutiny and could be the subject of further regulation that could impact the timing and cost of extractive activities.\nHydraulic fracturing is the primary production method used to extract hydrocarbon reserves located in many of the unconventional oil and gas plays in the United States. Following years of study, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in June 2015 issued a draft report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The draft report did not find evidence of widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources, but did identify spills and other mechanisms associated with hydraulic fracturing that could impact drinking water resources. The report, when finalized, may influence federal and state legislative and regulatory developments. Other federal regulatory developments in 2015 include (i) new rules by EPA which tightened the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone, which could result in additional mandatory controls on oil and gas sector volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions; and (ii) new rules by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management addressing hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands, including new requirements for well casing, cementing, wastewater disposal, and disclosure of chemicals used in well completions. In addition, in September 2015, EPA proposed, as part of the agency\u2019s Climate Action Plan, new regulations to further reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, including during well completions and hydraulic fracturing, and asserted that the industry is one of the largest emitters of methane, a green-house gas.\nHydraulic fracturing is also extensively regulated at the state and local level and has been subject to temporary or permanent moratoria in some states, although in 2015, it has not been subject to such moratoria in the states and locations of our oil and gas operations or minerals. Also under public and governmental scrutiny is subsurface injection of water or other produced fluids from drilling or hydraulic fracturing processes due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible links to swarms of earthquakes occurring in areas near certain injection wells. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas has hired a staff seismologist to study seismic activity and in 2014 adopted new rules for injection wells aimed at reducing the potential for earthquakes. Tighter regulation of injection wells could increase our costs of operations, including costs for well completions.\nDepending on legislation that may ultimately be enacted or regulations that may be adopted at the federal, state and local levels, exploration, exploitation and production activities that entail hydraulic fracturing or other subsurface injection could be subject to additional regulation and permitting requirements. Individually or collectively, such new legislation or regulation could lead to operational delays, increased costs and other burdens that could delay the development of oil and gas resources from formations that are not commercial without the use of these techniques. This could have a material effect on our oil and gas production operations and on the operators conducting activities on our minerals and on the cash flows we receive from them.\nOur reserves and production will decline from their current levels.\nThe rate of production from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced. Our reserves will decline as they are produced which could materially and adversely affect our future cash flow, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur oil and gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us.\nOur oil and gas production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including as a result of accidents, natural disasters, weather conditions, loss of gathering, processing, compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as oil and gas prices that the operators of our mineral leases, whose decisions we do not control, deem uneconomic. If a substantial amount of production is interrupted, our business, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities.\nThe exploration for, and production of, oil and gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities, result in injury or death, and damage property and the environment. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operations on our property in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. In addition, we require third party operators to maintain customary and commercially practicable types and limits of insurance, but potential losses or liabilities may not be covered by such third party\u2019s insurance which may subject us to liability as the mineral estate owner. The occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate and are unable to ensure their proper operation and profitability.\nMany of the properties in which we have working interests are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs and materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, operators determine when and where to drill wells and we have no influence over these decisions. The success and timing of the drilling and development activities on our non-operated properties therefore depends upon a number of factors currently outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s timing and amount of capital expenditures, expertise and financial resources, inclusion of other participants in drilling wells and use of technology, and the operators of our properties may not have the same financial and other resources as other oil and gas companies with whom they compete. Further, new wells may not be productive or may not produce at a level to enable us to recover all or any portion of our capital investment where we have a non-operating working interest.\nThe ability to sell and deliver oil and gas produced from wells on our mineral leasehold interests could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering, processing, compression and transportation services are not obtained.\nThe sale of oil and gas produced from wells on our mineral leasehold interests depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities owned or operated by third parties. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available in the future on terms the operator considers acceptable, if at all. In addition, federal, state and provincial governments in the United States and Canada have issued or are considering issuance of additional regulations governing transportation of crude oil and its byproducts by rail. Such regulations could increase the cost of transportation or limit the availability of suitable rail cars or both. Any significant change in market or other conditions affecting these facilities or the availability of these facilities, including due to the failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to the operator or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our Louisiana owned net mineral acres are subject to prescription of non-use under Louisiana law.\nA significant portion of our Louisiana owned net mineral acres were severed from surface ownership and retained by creation of one or more mineral servitudes shortly before our 2007 spin-off. Under Louisiana law, a mineral servitude that is not producing minerals or which has not been the subject of good-faith drilling operations will cease to burden the property upon the tenth anniversary of the date of its creation. Upon such event, the mineral rights effectively will revert to the surface owner and we will no longer own the right to lease, explore for or produce minerals from such acreage. Approximately 40,000 acres of our Louisiana owned net mineral acres may revert to the surface owner in 2017 unless drilling operations are commenced prior to the tenth anniversary of severance from the surface.\nWeather, climate and climate change regulation may have a significant and adverse impact on us.\nDemand for natural gas is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities produced from gas wells and, in turn, our cash flow and results of operations. For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for gas, higher inventory (as less gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, relatively lower prices for gas production.\nDrilling for and production of oil and gas also can be impacted by weather and climate. Specifically, cold temperatures or significant precipitation or both can restrict operation of machinery or access to well sites by personnel or equipment. These restrictions may reduce our production and, in turn, our cash flow and results of operations.\nThe EPA has proposed regulations for the purpose of restricting greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources. Such regulatory and legislative proposals to restrict greenhouse gas emissions, or to address climate change generally, could increase our operating costs as well operators incur costs to comply with new rules. Such increased costs may include installation of new or expanded emissions control systems, purchase of allowances to authorize greenhouse gas emissions, and increased taxes. Regulation of greenhouse gases may also occur at the state level. Depending on legislation that may ultimately be enacted or regulations that may be adopted at the Federal or state level, there could be increased costs, operational delays and other burdens affecting the oil and gas industry. This could have a material effect on our oil and gas production operations and on the operators conducting activities on our properties and on cash flows we receive from them.\nRisks Related to our Other Natural Resources Operations\nOur water interests may require governmental permits, the consent of third parties and/or completion of significant transportation infrastructure prior to commercialization, all of which are dependent on the actions of others.\nMany jurisdictions require governmental permits to withdraw and transport water for commercial uses, the granting of which may be subject to discretionary determinations by such jurisdictions regarding necessity. In addition, we do not own the executory rights related to our non-participating royalty interest, and as a result, third-party consent from the executor rights owner(s) would be required prior to production. The process to obtain permits can be lengthy, and governmental jurisdictions or third parties from whom we seek permits or consent may not provide the approvals we seek. We may be unable to secure buyers at commercially economic prices for water that we have a right to extract and transport, and transportation infrastructure across property not owned or controlled by us is required for transport of water prior to commercial use. Such infrastructure can require significant capital and may also require the consent of third parties. We may not have cost effective means to transport water from property we own, lease or manage to buyers. As a result, we may lose some or all of our investment in water assets, or our returns may be diminished.\nOur ability to harvest and deliver timber may be affected by our sales of timberland and may be subject to other limitations, which could adversely affect our operations.\nSales of our timberland reduce the amount of timber that we have available for harvest. In addition, weather conditions, timber growth cycles, access limitations, availability of contract loggers and haulers, and regulatory requirements associated with the protection of wildlife and water resources may restrict harvesting of timberlands as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought, flooding and other natural disasters. Although damage from such natural causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of the timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be so limited. As is common in the forest products industry, we do not maintain insurance coverage with respect to damage to our timberlands.\nThe revenues, income and cash flow from operations for our other natural resources segment are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels.\nOther Risks\nThe market price of and trading volume of our shares of common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our shares of common stock has fluctuated substantially and may continue to fluctuate in response to the following factors, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results, including results that vary from expectations of management, analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in investors\u2019 and analysts\u2019 perception of the business risks and conditions of our business;\n\u2022\nbroader market fluctuations;\n\u2022\ngeneral financial, economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our businesses and operations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulations and liabilities that could have a negative effect on our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions, financings and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock held by existing security holders in the public market; and\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the real estate and mineral resources industries.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, make it difficult to predict the market price of our common stock in the future and cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our charter documents, the indentures governing the 3.75% convertible senior notes, 8.50% senior secured notes and the stock purchase contracts under the 6.00% tangible equity units may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our board of directors has the power, without stockholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of\npreferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock. These and other impediments to third party acquisition or change of control could limit the price investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock, which could in turn reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change under the terms of the convertible senior notes, the senior secured notes or the tangible equity units, certain repurchase rights and early settlement rights would be triggered under the indentures governing the convertible senior notes, senior secured notes and the stock purchase contracts under the 6.00% tangible equity units, respectively. In such event, the increase of the conversion or early settlement rate, as applicable, in connection with certain make-whole fundamental change transactions under the terms of the convertible senior notes or the stock purchase contracts, respectively, could discourage a potential acquirer.", "PERMNO": 92478, "SIC": 6552, "TIC": "FOR"}
