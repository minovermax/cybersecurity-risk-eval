RISK FACTORS\nThe following are significant risk factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results, industry, financial position, or future financial performance:\nOur net sales and earnings could be adversely affected by economic conditions and outlook in the U.S. and in other countries in which we conduct business.\nAdverse economic conditions and outlook in the U.S. and in other countries in which we conduct business can impact demand for our products and, ultimately, our net sales and earnings. These include, but are not limited to, recessionary conditions; slow or negative economic growth rates; the impact of U.S. federal debt, state debt, and sovereign debt defaults and austerity measures by certain European countries; reduced governmental or municipal spending; slow down or reductions in levels of golf course development, renovation, and improvement; golf course closures; reduced levels of home ownership, construction, and sales; home foreclosures; negative consumer confidence; reduced consumer spending levels resulting from tax increases or other factors; increased unemployment rates; prolonged high unemployment rates; higher costs of commodities, components, parts, and accessories and/or transportation-related costs, including as a result of inflation, changing prices, tariffs, and/or duties; inflationary or deflationary pressures; reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for our distributors, dealers, and end-user customers; higher short-term, mortgage, and other interest rates; reduced infrastructure spending; and general economic and political conditions and expectations. In the past, some of these factors have caused our distributors, dealers, and end-user customers to reduce spending and delay or forego purchases of our products, which have had an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.\nWeather conditions may reduce demand for some of our products and adversely affect our net sales or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nFrom time to time, weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales, demand, and field inventory levels of some of our products. For example, in the past, drought or unusually wet conditions have had an adverse effect on sales of certain mowing equipment products, unusually rainy weather or severe drought conditions that result in watering bans, or otherwise, have had an adverse effect on sales of our irrigation products, and lower snowfall accumulations in key markets have had an adverse effect on sales of our Residential snow thrower products and products of our Professional snow and\nice management business. Similarly, adverse weather conditions in one season may negatively impact customer purchasing patterns and net sales for some of our products in another season. For example, lower snowfall accumulations may result in lower winter season revenues for landscape contractor professionals, causing such customers to forego or postpone spring purchases of our mowing equipment products. To the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, our sales and operating results may be affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have affected our operating results and could continue to result in declines in our reported net sales and net earnings.\nBecause the functional currency of most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency, and because our financial reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires that we translate the assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. Accordingly, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries, sales to third-party customers, purchases from suppliers, and bank lines of credit with creditors denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary foreign currency exchange rate exposure is with the Euro, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Mexican peso, the Japanese yen, the Chinese Renminbi, and the Romanian New Leu against the U.S. dollar, as well as the Romanian New Leu against the Euro.\nOur reported net sales and net earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that have affected our operating results and could continue to result in declines in our reported net sales and net earnings. Because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the U.S. and Mexico, a stronger U.S. dollar and Mexican peso generally have a negative impact on our operating results, while a weaker U.S. dollar and Mexican peso generally have a positive effect. In addition, currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect the comparative prices between products we sell and products our foreign competitors sell in the same market, which may adversely affect demand for our products. Substantial exchange rate fluctuations as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar or otherwise, may have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows, as well as the comparability of our Consolidated Financial Statements between reporting periods. Further, we may also experience foreign currency exchange rate exposure as a result of the volatility and uncertainty that may arise as a result of the United Kingdom's process for exiting the EU.\nWhile we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency market risk in the normal course of business by entering into various derivative instruments to hedge against such risk, these derivative instruments involve risks and may not effectively limit our underlying exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or minimize our net earnings and cash volatility\nassociated with foreign currency exchange rate changes. Further, the failure of one or more counterparties to our foreign currency exchange rate contracts to fulfill their obligations to us could adversely affect our operating results.\nIncreases in the cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories that we purchase and/or increases in our other costs of doing business, have, and could continue to, adversely affect our profit margins and businesses.\nWe purchase commodities, components, parts, and accessories for use in our manufacturing process and end-products or to be sold as standalone end-products. Most of the commodities, components, parts, and accessories used in our manufacturing process and end-products are exposed to commodity cost changes, including, for example, as a result of inflation, deflation, changing prices, tariffs, and/or duties. Our primary commodity cost exposures are with steel, aluminum, petroleum and natural gas-based resins, copper, lead, rubber, linerboard, and others. To the extent that commodity, component, parts, or accessories costs increase, as a result of inflation, tariffs, duties, or otherwise, and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers, or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices, we may experience a decline in our profit margins. Furthermore, changes to international trade policies or agreements could result in additional tariffs, duties or other charges on commodities, components, parts or accessories we import into the U.S. and/or use in our products. In addition, increases in other costs of doing business may also adversely affect our profit margins and businesses. For example, an increase in fuel costs and/or freight rates may result in an increase in our transportation costs, which also could adversely affect our operating results and businesses.\nHistorically, we have mitigated commodity, component, parts, or accessories cost increases, in part, by collaborating with suppliers, reviewing alternative sourcing options, substituting materials, utilizing Lean methods, engaging in internal cost reduction efforts, and increasing prices on some of our products, all as appropriate. However, we may not be able to fully offset increased commodity, component, parts, or accessories costs in the future. Further, if our price increases are not accepted by our customers and the market, our net sales, profit margins, earnings, and market share could be adversely affected.\nDisruption and/or shortages in the availability of commodities, components, parts, or accessories used in our products has, and could continue to, adversely affect our business.\nAlthough most of the commodities, components, parts or accessories used in our end-products or sold as standalone end-products are generally commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply, certain items are sourced from single suppliers. Any disruption or shortages in the availability of commodities, components, parts, or accessories used in our end-products or sold as standalone end-products, including as a result of labor staffing or other challenges that may be experienced by our suppliers, natural disasters, adverse weather, or other events, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our\nrelationships with, the financial viability or quality of, or the personnel relationships at, our suppliers, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur Professional segment includes a variety of product portfolios that are dependent upon certain and varied factors.\nOur Professional segment includes a variety of product portfolios that are sold by distributors or dealers, or directly to government customers, rental companies, construction companies, and professional users engaged in maintaining and creating properties and landscapes, such as golf courses, sports fields, residential and commercial properties and landscapes, and governmental and municipal properties. Among other things, any one or a combination of the following factors could result in a decrease in spending and demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our Professional segment net sales:\n\u2022\nreduced levels of investment in golf course renovations and improvements and new golf course development; reduced revenue for golf courses resulting from a decrease in rounds played and/or memberships, as applicable; and increased number of golf course closures;\n\u2022\nreduced consumer and business spending on property maintenance, such as lawn care and snow and ice removal activities, and/or unfavorable weather conditions, causing property owners and landscape contractor professionals to forego or postpone purchases of our products;\n\u2022\nlow or reduced levels of residential, commercial, and/or municipal construction projects and/or infrastructure improvements;\n\u2022\na decline in acceptance of and demand for ag-irrigation solutions for agricultural production;\n\u2022\navailability of cash or credit on acceptable terms to finance new product purchases; and\n\u2022\ncustomer and/or government budgetary constraints resulting in reduced spending for grounds maintenance or construction equipment.\nOur Residential segment net sales are dependent upon consumers buying our Residential segment products at dealers, mass retailers, and home centers; the amount of product placement at mass retailers and home centers; consumer confidence and spending levels; changing buying patterns of customers; and the impact of significant sales or promotional events.\nThe elimination or reduction of shelf space assigned to our Residential segment products or other changes to the placement of our products by or at mass retailers and home centers, could adversely affect our Residential segment net sales. Our Residential segment net sales also are dependent upon the buying patterns of consumers and changing buying patterns of consumers could result in reduced sales of one or more of our Residential segment products. For example, as consumers purchase products at home centers and mass retailers that offer broader and lower price points than dealers, we have experienced increased demand and sales of our Residential segment products purchased at mass retailers and home centers. Historically, The Home Depot has been a substantial customer\nof ours, which accounted for approximately 10.0 percent of our total consolidated gross sales in fiscal 2017. We believe that our diverse distribution channels and customer base should reduce the long-term impact on us if we were to lose any substantial customer. However, the loss of any substantial customer, a significant reduction in sales to such customers, or our inability to maintain adequate product placement at mass retailers and home centers or our inability to respond to future changes in buying patterns of consumers or new distribution channels could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. Furthermore, our quarterly or annual results can be impacted as a result of the timing of significant sales or promotional events for our Residential products.\nChanges in our product mix between reportable segments and/or within a reportable segment could adversely impact our financial performance, including profit margins and net earnings.\nOur Professional segment products generally have higher profit margins than our Residential segment products. Accordingly, our financial performance, including our profit margins and net earnings, can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell during a given period. For example, if we experience lower sales of our Professional segment products that generally carry higher profit margins than our Residential segment products, our financial performance, including profit margins and net earnings, could be negatively impacted. Similarly, within each reportable segment, if we experience lower sales of products that generally carry higher profit margins, our financial performance, including profit margins and net earnings, could be negatively impacted.\nWe intend to grow our business in part through acquisitions and alliances, strong customer relations, and new joint ventures, investments, and partnerships, which could be risky and may harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOne of our strategies is to drive growth in our businesses and accelerate opportunities to expand our global presence through targeted acquisitions and alliances, such as our CMW acquisition, strong customer relations, and new joint ventures, investments, and partnerships that add value while supplementing and complementing our existing brands and product portfolio. Our ability to grow through acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices, terms, and conditions, our ability to compete effectively for acquisition candidates, and the availability of capital and personnel resources to complete such acquisitions and run and integrate the acquired business effectively. Any acquisition, alliance, joint venture, investment, or partnership could impair our business, financial condition, reputation, and operating results. The benefits of an acquisition, or new alliance, joint venture, investment, or partnership may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee that previous or future acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, investments, or partnerships will, in fact, produce any benefits. Acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, investments, and partnerships may involve a number\nof risks, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention;\n\u2022\ndisruption to our existing operations and plans;\n\u2022\ninability to effectively manage our expanded operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations, manufacturing processes and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings, and synergies;\n\u2022\ninability to successfully integrate or develop a distribution channel for acquired product lines;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, or dealers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, customers, distributors, and dealers;\n\u2022\nwrite-off of significant amounts of goodwill, other intangible assets, and/or long-lived assets as a result of deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line, adverse market conditions, changes in the competitive landscape, changes in laws or regulations that restrict activities of an acquired business or product line, or as a result of a variety of other circumstances;\n\u2022\ndelays or challenges in transitioning distributors and dealers of acquired businesses to available floor plan financing arrangements;\n\u2022\nviolation of confidentiality, intellectual property, and non-compete obligations or agreements by employees of an acquired business or lack of or inadequate formal intellectual property protection mechanisms in place at an acquired business;\n\u2022\nadverse impact on overall profitability if our expanded operations do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models;\n\u2022\nreallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay acquisition purchase prices or other business venture investment costs, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\n\u2022\nfailure by acquired businesses or other business ventures to comply with applicable international, federal, and state product safety or other regulatory standards;\n\u2022\ninfringement by acquired businesses or other business ventures of intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition or business venture investments, undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition or other business venture, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and\n\u2022\nincorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions and incurrence of non-recurring charges.\nIn addition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively\nprevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses may result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement, and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, particularly in the context of acquisitions of other businesses, regardless of whether such acquired business was previously privately or publicly held. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our internal control framework could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Also, some acquisitions may require the consent of the lenders under our credit agreements. We cannot predict whether such approvals would be forthcoming or the terms on which the lenders would approve such acquisitions. These risks, among others, could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or other business venture or multiple transactions within a relatively short period of time.\nOur recent acquisition of The Charles Machine Works, Inc. involves a number of risks, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOn April 1, 2019, we completed our acquisition of CMW. Such acquisition involves certain risks, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention to manage the CMW businesses and integrate CMW\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\ndisruption to our existing operations and plans or inability to effectively manage our expanded operations;\n\u2022\nfailure, difficulties or delays in securing, integrating and assimilating information, financial systems, internal controls, operations, manufacturing processes and products, or the distribution channel for CMW\u2019s businesses and product lines;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, dealers, or suppliers or other adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers, distributors, dealers, and suppliers;\n\u2022\nadverse impact on overall profitability if our expanded operations do not achieve the growth prospects, net sales, earnings, cost or revenue synergies, or other financial results projected in our valuation models, delays in the realization thereof or costs or charges incurred to achieve any revenue or cost synergies, including as a result of the Toro underground wind down or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to fund the purchase price of the acquisition could restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed, result in a decrease in our credit rating, or limit our ability to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities, unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition, and despite the existence of representations, warranties and indemnities in the merger agreement and a\nrepresentation and warranty insurance policy, an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and\n\u2022\nimpacts as a result of purchase accounting adjustments, incorrect estimates made in the accounting for the acquisition, or the potential future write-off of significant amounts of goodwill, intangible assets and/or other tangible long-lived assets if the CMW business does not perform in the future as expected, or other potential financial accounting or reporting impacts.\nWe may be required to incur impairment and other charges resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions.\nWe recently completed the CMW acquisition and expect to continue to complete selected acquisitions in the future as a component of our growth strategy. In connection with acquisitions, applicable accounting standards generally require the net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill. Definite lived-intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this amortization expense may be significant. If it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business, the assets, including both definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets, or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired. In this case, the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment. This write-down of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a non-cash expense in the statement of operations of the acquirunsuing company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs. As of October 31, 2019, we had goodwill of $362.3 million, which is maintained in various reporting units, including goodwill from the CMW acquisition, and other intangible assets of $352.4 million, which together comprise 30.7 percent of our total assets as of October 31, 2019. If we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets recorded in connection with the CMW acquisition or any other prior or future acquisitions have become impaired, we will be required to record a charge resulting from the impairment. Impairment charges could be significant and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nOur labor needs, and those of our suppliers and distribution channel partners, fluctuate throughout the year and by region. Any failure by us, or our suppliers or distribution channel partners, to hire and/or retain a labor force to adequately staff manufacturing operations, perform service or warranty work, or other necessary activities or by such labor force to adequately and safely perform their jobs could, among other things, result in disruptions in our manufacturing and other processes, which have, and could\ncontinue to, adversely affect our business and operating results and, our reputation could suffer.\nOur labor needs, and those of our suppliers and distribution channel partners, fluctuate throughout the year and by region. During periods of peak manufacturing activity it is often necessary to sharply increase the number of production staff by utilizing new hires and temporary labor. Production staff hired during such periods of peak manufacturing activity may not have the same level of training, competency, experience, or commitment as regular production employees. In addition, as a result of low unemployment rates, a limited workforce population available in areas around the locations where we, or our suppliers and distribution channel partners, manufacture products or conduct business, or other factors, we, or our suppliers and distribution channel partners, may not have a sufficient pool of experienced and competent individuals with the right skills available to fulfill labor requirements on a cost-effective basis or otherwise. If we, or our suppliers and distribution channel partners, are unable to hire and/or retain a labor force to adequately staff manufacturing operations, perform service or warranty work, or other necessary activities, particularly during periods of peak manufacturing activity, or if such labor force is not adequately trained or does not adhere to protocols established to create a safe workplace, we could experience, among other things, disruptions in our manufacturing and other processes, which could adversely impact our business, operating results and reputation.\nFailure to successfully complete divestitures or other restructuring activities could negatively affect our operations.\nFrom time to time, we may divest of all or a portion of certain businesses, joint venture or minority equity investment interests, subsidiaries, or product categories. For example, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we divested of a used underground construction equipment business, which we acquired as a result of our acquisition of CMW. Divestitures involve risk, including, potential increased expense associated with the divestitures, potential issues with the customers or suppliers of the divested business or products, and potential issues with the acquirers of any divested business. Additionally, from time to time, we may wind down certain business activities, product lines, and/or perform other organizational restructuring projects in an effort to reduce costs and streamline operations. For example, in fiscal 2019, we decided to wind down our Toro-branded large directional drill and riding trencher product categories and pursue other organizational restructuring activities as part of our initial CMW integration objectives. Such activities involve risks as they may divert management's attention from our core businesses, increase expenses on a short-term basis and lead to potential issues with employees, customers or suppliers. If these activities are not completed in a timely manner, anticipated cost savings, synergies and efficiencies are not realized, business disruption occurs during the pendency of or following such activities, or unanticipated charges are incurred, particularly if material, there may be a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we underestimate or overestimate demand for our products and do not maintain appropriate inventory levels, our net sales and/or working capital could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to manage our inventory levels to meet our customers' demand for our products is important for our business. Our production levels and inventory management goals for our products are based on estimates of demand for our products, taking into account production capacity, timing of shipments, and field inventory levels. If we overestimate or underestimate both channel and retail demand for any of our products during a given season, we may not maintain appropriate inventory levels, which could negatively impact our net sales, profit margins, net earnings, and/or working capital, hinder our ability to meet customer demand, result in loss of customers, or cause us to incur excess and obsolete inventory charges.\nOur business and operating results are subject to the inventory management decisions of our distribution channel customers.\nWe are subject to risks relating to the inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices of our distribution network. Our distribution channel customers carry inventories of our products as part of their ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs, including anticipated end-customer demand. Such adjustments may impact our inventory management and working capital goals as well as operating results. If the inventory levels of our distribution channel customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our inventory management and working capital goals as well as our operating results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of sales if either we do not produce an adequate supply of products for our distribution channel and/or our distribution channel customers do not maintain field inventory levels sufficient to meet end-user demand.\nChanges in composition of, financial viability of, and the relationships with, our distribution channel customers could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective network of dealers and distributors for our products, we may not have adequate market coverage for the optimal level of sales of our products. Additionally, our distribution channel customers may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations, and, regardless of the resources they commit, they may not be successful. Any weak demand for, or quality issues with, our products may cause our distribution channel customers to reduce or terminate their relationships with us or adversely affect our ability to engage new dealers and distributors. Changes in the ownership or control of our distribution channel customers could also adversely affect our relationships with them. If we are not able to maintain effective distribution channels, if our distribution channel customers are not successful in the marketing and selling our products, or if we experience a significant reduction in, cancellation or change in the size and timing of orders from\nour distribution channel customers, our sales could decline and have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn addition, if adverse economic or business conditions or other events causes a decline in sales by our distribution channel customers or weakens their financial condition, our net sales and earnings could be adversely affected. Such situation could adversely affect the ability of such customers to pay amounts owed, which could require us to repurchase financed product.\nWe face intense competition in all of our product lines with numerous manufacturers, including some that have larger operations and greater financial resources than us. We may not be able to compete effectively against competitors' actions, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Principal competitive factors in our markets include product innovation, quality and reliability, pricing, product support and customer service, warranty, brand awareness, reputation, distribution, product availability, product placement and shelf space, and financing options. We compete in many product lines with numerous manufacturers, some of which have substantially larger operations and greater financial resources than us. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer preferences, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products or disruptive new products or technologies than we can. In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the market, existing competitors combine or consolidate their operations or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines. Our current products, products under development, and our ability to develop new and improved products may be insufficient to enable us to compete effectively with our competitors. Internationally, our Residential segment products typically face more competition because many foreign competitors design, manufacture, and market products in their respective countries. We experience this competition primarily in Europe. In addition, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect the price of our products in foreign markets, thereby impacting their competitiveness. We may not be able to compete effectively against competitors' actions, which may include the movement by competitors with manufacturing operations to low cost countries for significant cost and price reductions, and which could harm our business and operating results.\nA significant percentage of our consolidated net sales is generated outside of the U.S., a portion of which is financed by third-parties, and we intend to continue to expand our international operations. Our international operations require significant management attention and financial resources, expose us to difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, regulatory, accounting, and business factors, and may not be successful or produce desired levels of net sales.\nWe currently manufacture our products in the U.S., Mexico, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Germany, Poland, and China for sale throughout the world. We maintain\nsales offices in the U.S., Belgium, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, China, Italy, Poland, Germany, Spain, and France. Our net sales outside the U.S. were 23.1 percent, 24.6 percent, and 24.4 percent of our total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. International markets have been, and will continue to be, a focus for us for revenue growth, both organically and through acquisitions. We believe many opportunities exist in the international markets, and over time, we intend for international net sales to comprise a larger percentage of our total consolidated net sales. Several factors, including the implications of the United Kingdom's process for exiting the EU, implications of withdrawal by the U.S. from, or revisions to, international trade agreements, foreign trade or other policy changes between the U.S. and other countries, weakened international economic conditions or the impact of sovereign debt defaults by certain European countries, could adversely affect our international net sales. Additionally, the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets require significant management attention and financial resources. Many of the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products, or otherwise have an international presence are, to some degree, subject to political, economic, and/or social instability. Our international operations expose us and our representatives, agents, and distribution channel customers to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u2022\nincreased costs of customizing products for foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations and increases in infrastructure costs including legal, tax, accounting, and information technology;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n\u2022\nnew or enhanced trade restrictions and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and distribution channel customers;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal from or revisions to international trade policies or agreements and the imposition or increases in import and export licensing and other compliance requirements, customs duties and tariffs, import and export quotas and other trade restrictions, license obligations, and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country, company, person, or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit our business with the sanctioned country, company, person, or entity;\n\u2022\ninternational pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nadverse currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nhigher tax rates and potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating cash and/or earnings to the U.S.;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating performance based on our geographic mix of sales;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\nnational and international conflicts, including foreign policy changes, acts of war or terrorist acts;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting, enforcing or defending intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nmultiple, changing, and often inconsistent enforcement of laws, rules, regulations and standards, including rules relating to taxes, environmental, health and safety matters.\nOur international operations may not produce desired levels of net sales or, among other things one or more of the factors listed above may harm our business and operating results. Any material decrease in our international sales or profitability could also adversely impact our operating results.\nIn addition, a portion of our international net sales is financed by third-parties. The termination of our agreements with these third-parties, any material change to the terms of our agreements with these third-parties or in the availability or terms of credit offered to our international customers by these third-parties, or any delay in securing replacement credit sources, could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nBrexit and political uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the EU could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have manufacturing operations and a sales office in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom\u2019s intention to exit the EU, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d has caused significant political and economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom, EU, and elsewhere. The impact of Brexit and the resulting turmoil on the political and economic future of the United Kingdom and the EU is uncertain, and we may be adversely affected in ways we cannot currently anticipate. The ultimate effects of Brexit will depend, in part, on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to the EU markets, and vice versa, either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit also may result in significant changes in the British regulatory environment, which could increase our compliance costs. We may find it more difficult to conduct business in the United Kingdom and the EU, as Brexit may result in increased regulatory complexity and increased restrictions on the movement of capital, goods and personnel. Any of these effects of Brexit, and other similar referenda that we cannot anticipate, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges to or withdrawal from trade regulation, quotas, duties, agreements, policies, or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nUncertainty exists regarding the future relationship between the U.S. and other countries with respect to trade regulation, quotas, duties, agreements, policies, and tariffs. The current U.S. administration has called for support for implementing and, in some instances, has already proposed or taken action with respect to major changes to certain trade agreements or policies. Furthermore, the U.S. or other countries that are parties to various trade agreements may not approve or ratify any new or revised trade agreements. Implications of withdrawal by the U.S. from, or revisions to, international trade agreements, foreign trade or other policy changes between the U.S. and other countries could adversely and materially affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to continue to enhance existing products, as well as develop and market new products, that respond to customer needs and preferences and achieve market acceptance, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products, and our net sales, which have historically benefited from the introduction of new products, may be adversely affected.\nOne of our strategies is to develop innovative, customer-valued products to generate revenue growth. In the past, our sales from new products, which we define as those introduced in the current and previous two fiscal years, have represented a significant component of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales. We may not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers, unless we can continue to enhance existing products and develop new innovative products for the markets in which we compete, including by incorporating new, emerging, and/or disruptive technologies that may become preferred by our customers. Product development requires significant financial, technological, talent, and other resources. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant research, planning, design, development, engineering, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels and we may not be able to timely develop and introduce product improvements or new products. Our competitors' new products may beat our products to market, be higher quality or more reliable, be more effective with more features and/or less expensive than our products, incorporate new, emerging, and/or disruptive technologies, obtain better market acceptance, or render our products obsolete. Any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs, and research and development.\nAny disruption at any of our facilities or in our manufacturing or other operations, or those of our distribution channel customers or suppliers, or our inability to cost-effectively expand existing, open and manage new or acquired, and/or move production between manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe currently manufacture most of our products at 14 locations in the U.S., two locations in both Mexico and China, and one location in each of Australia, Italy, the United Kingdom, Romania, Germany, and Poland. We also have several locations that serve as distribution centers, warehouses, test labs, service centers, and corporate offices. In addition, we have agreements with other third-party manufacturers to manufacture products on our behalf. We also market our products through domestic and international distributors, as well as a large number of dealers, hardware retailers, home centers, mass retailers and online, and source commodities, components, parts, and accessories from a variety of international and domestic suppliers.\nOur facilities and our manufacturing and other operations and those of our distribution channel customers and suppliers may incur losses or experience disruptions as a result of natural disasters, inclement weather, and/or climate change-related events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, typhoons, drought, fire, other extreme weather conditions, and other natural disasters and events that occur as a result of such events, such as water or other natural resource shortages, rising sea levels, power shortages, or telecommunications failures. In addition, losses or disruptions could occur as a result of man-made disasters and other external events, such as terrorist acts or acts of war, pandemics, boycotts and sanctions or widespread criminal activities such as drug cartel-related violence that may disrupt our production activities and maquiladora operations based in Juarez, Mexico. A work slowdown, strike, or similar action could occur at any one of our facilities (or the facilities of our distribution channel customers and suppliers) currently operating under a collective bargaining agreement, such facilities could fail to renew or enter into new collective bargaining agreements, or we may have to enter into a new collective bargaining agreement at a facility not currently covered by an agreement. Furthermore, we could decide, or be forced, to shift production to one of our other manufacturing facilities or we may decide to open new or acquired manufacturing or distribution facilities or move production between our facilities to align production capacity with production goals.\nSuch events and disruptions could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or to deliver products to our distribution channel customers, produce or maintain sufficient inventory of our products, meet the demands of our customers, receive commodities, components, parts or accessories from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business globally or in certain regions. Such events also may result in shortages of commodities, components, parts, or accessories, higher fuel and commodity costs, and delays in shipments to our distribution channel customers. Our business and operating results could be\nimpacted to a greater degree than we previously experienced to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise. Our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters and other disruptions is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate, or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. The occurrence of any such events could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nManagement information systems are critical to our business. If our management information systems or those of our business partners or third-party service providers fail to adequately perform, or if we, our business partners, or third-party service providers experience an interruption in the operation of such systems, our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have many management information systems that are critical to our business, some of which are managed by third-parties. These management information systems are used to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including, among other things, our accounting and financial functions, including maintaining our internal controls; our manufacturing and supply chain processes; and the data related to our research and development efforts.\nWe may be unable to enhance our existing management information systems or implement new management information systems when necessary, may experience unanticipated delays, complications or expenses in implementing, integrating and operating our systems, and/or require substantial expenditures as well as interruptions in operations in connection with any system changes we might pursue, including as may be necessary during the integration of CMW. The failure of our management information systems or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly, or difficulties encountered in the development of or transfer over to new systems or the modification or upgrade of existing systems, could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.\nAdditionally, we take steps to secure our management information systems and any access provided by our business partners or third-party service providers, including our computer systems, intranet and internet sites, email and other telecommunications and data networks. However, the security measures we have implemented may not be effective and our systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage, and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, natural or man-made disasters, cyber attacks, computer viruses, malware, phishing, denial of service attacks, power loss, or other disruptive events. Information technology security threats have been increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cyber attacks\nmay be random, coordinated, or targeted, including sophisticated computer crime threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and those of our business partners and third-party service providers, and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations are disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; our intranet and internet sites are compromised; data is manipulated or destroyed; we incur costs, are required to pay fines, or our customers lose confidence in our ability to adequately protect their information in connection with stolen or disclosed customer, employee, or other confidential or sensitive information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.\nOur reliance upon patents, trademark laws, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products. In addition, our products may infringe the proprietary rights of others.\nWe hold patents relating to various aspects of our products and believe that proprietary technical know-how is important to our business and the loss of such intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third-parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. We cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In the absence of enforceable patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know-how. Others may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, allege that we infringe their patents, or use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors or others initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or allege that we infringe their patents, or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe also cannot be certain that our products or technologies have not infringed or will not infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third-parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs, possible damages and substantial uncertainty. We could also be forced to develop an alternative that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license, which we might not be able to do on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nWe rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our\nemployees, suppliers, consultants, and others. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Even if these confidentiality agreements are not breached, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nOur business, properties, and products are subject to governmental policies and regulations, with which compliance may require us to incur expenses, or modify our products or operations, and non-compliance may result in harm to our reputation and/or expose us to penalties. Governmental policies and regulations may also adversely affect the demand for some of our products and our operating results.\nOur business, properties, and products are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and other governmental laws, rules, policies, and regulations relating to, among other things; climate change; emissions to air, including engine emission requirements; discharges to water; restrictions placed on water usage and water availability; product and associated packaging; use of certain chemicals; restricted substances, including \"conflict minerals\" disclosure rules; import and export compliance, including country of origin certification requirements; worker and product user health and safety; energy efficiency; product life-cycles; outdoor noise laws; the generation, use, handling, labeling, collection, management, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, and other regulated materials; and the registration of certain technologies with various government agencies throughout the world and operation of those technologies within the limits imposed by those agencies, including but not limited to radio frequency, broadband or other wireless technologies and technologies within the airspace of commercial airplanes, such as unmanned aerial systems. In addition, our business is subject to numerous international, federal, state, and other governmental laws, rules, policies, and regulations that may adversely affect our operating results, including, (i) taxation and tax policy changes, tax rate changes, new tax laws, or revised tax law interpretations or guidance, including as a result of the Tax Act, which individually or in combination may cause our effective tax rate to increase or result in tax charges, (ii) healthcare laws or regulations, which may cause us to incur higher employee healthcare costs, or (iii) changes to U.S. or international trade policies or agreements that could result in additional tariffs, duties or other charges on commodities, components, parts or accessories that we import and/or use in our products. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws, rules, policies, and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or future laws, rules, policies, and regulations on our business, properties, or products. Any of these laws, rules, policies, or regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses to achieve or maintain compliance, require us to modify our products, adversely affect the price of, or demand for, some of our products, and ultimately affect the way we conduct our operations. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules, policies, or regulations could result in harm to our reputation and/or could lead to fines and other penalties,\nincluding restrictions on the importation of our products into, and the sale of our products in, one or more jurisdictions until compliance is achieved. In addition, our competitors may adopt strategies with respect to compliance with any such laws, rules, policies or regulations that differ significantly from our strategies. This may have the effect of changing customer preferences and our markets in ways that we did not anticipate which may adversely affect market demand for our products and, ultimately, our net sales and financial results. Other laws or regulations impacting our supply chain, such as the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act, or data privacy requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, may have similar consequences.\nChanges in accounting standards, policies, or assumptions utilized in determining accounting estimates could adversely affect our financial statements, including our operating results and financial condition.\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we must make decisions that impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial and other independent external third-party specialist valuations, all as appropriate. As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared. In addition, various authoritative accounting or regulatory entities, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the SEC may amend, expand, and/or eliminate the financial accounting or reporting standards that govern the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements or could reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various financial accounting and/or reporting standards should be applied. For example, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, that amend the accounting standards and related disclosure requirements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting, respectively. Additionally, the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Stock-based Compensation, during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 has added, and we expect that it will continue to add, variability to our provision for income taxes, mainly due to the timing of stock option exercises, vesting of restricted stock units, and the trading price of our common stock. We disclose the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet adopted within our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. However, we do not provide an assessment of proposed accounting pronouncements, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore, we cannot meaningfully assess their effects on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Future changes to accounting standards could modify the accounting policies and procedures that are\ncurrently utilized in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such changes may be difficult to predict and implement and could materially, or otherwise, impact how we prepare and report our Consolidated Financial Statements, results of operations, and financial condition. For additional information regarding our accounting policies, accounting pronouncements adopted, and accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" of this report in the section entitled \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Related Data, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nClimate change legislation, regulations, or accords may adversely impact our operations.\nWe are currently subject to rules limiting emissions and other climate-related rules and regulations in certain jurisdictions where we operate. In addition, we may become subject to additional legislation, regulations, or accords regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly as a result of increased energy, environmental, and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with any such legislation, regulation, or accord. Due to uncertainty in the regulatory and legislative processes and the negotiation and adoption of international climate change accords, as well as the scope of such requirements and initiatives, we cannot currently determine the effect any such legislation, regulation, or accord may have on our products and operations.\nThe costs of complying with the various environmental laws related to our ownership and/or lease of real property, such as clean-up costs and liabilities that may be associated with certain hazardous waste disposal activities, could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nBecause we own and lease real property, various environmental laws may impose liability on us for the costs of cleaning up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been released on our property, including releases unknown to us. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at third-party locations where we disposed of or recycled hazardous substances. We are currently involved in the evaluation and clean-up of a limited number of properties we either currently or previously owned. Although we do not expect that these current matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operating results, our future costs of complying with the various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future, could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nLegislative enactments could impact the competitive landscape within our markets and affect demand for our products.\nVarious legislative proposals, if enacted, could put us in a competitively advantaged or disadvantaged position and affect customer demand for our products relative to the product offerings of our competitors. For example, any fiscal-stimulus or other legislative enactment that inordinately impacts the lawn and garden, outdoor power equipment, or irrigation industries generally by promoting the purchase, such as through customer rebate or other incentive programs, of certain types of mowing, snow and ice management, or irrigation equipment or other products that we sell, could impact us positively or negatively, depending on whether we manufacture products that meet the specified legislative criteria, including in areas such as fuel efficiency, alternative energy or water usage, or if, as a result of such legislation, customers perceive our product offerings to be relatively more or less attractive than our competitors' product offerings. We cannot currently predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, what any such legislation's specific terms and conditions would encompass, how any such legislation would impact the competitive landscape within our markets, or how, if at all, any such legislation might ultimately affect customer demand for our products or our operating results.\nWe operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws.\nThe U.S. FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making certain improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The continued expansion of our international operations could increase the risk of violations of these laws in the future. Significant violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could harm our reputation, disrupt our business, and result in significant fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to product quality issues, product liability claims, and other litigation from time to time that could adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results or financial condition.\nThe manufacture, sale, and use of our products expose us to significant risks associated with product quality issues and product liability claims. If a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage, and it is ultimately determined that we are liable, our business could suffer. While we believe that we appropriately instruct our customers on the proper usage of our products, we cannot ensure that they will implement our instructions accurately or completely. If our products are defective or used incorrectly by our customers, injury may result and this could give rise to product quality issues and/or product liability claims against us or adversely affect our brand image or reputation. Any losses that we may suffer from product\nquality issues and/or product liability claims, and the effect that any product quality and/or product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability of our products, may have a negative impact on our business, reputation, and operating results. Product defects can occur through our own product development, design, and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third-parties for certain component design and manufacturing activities. Some of our products or product improvements were developed relatively recently and defects or risks that we have not yet identified, such as unanticipated use of our products, may give rise to product quality issues and/or product liability claims. Additionally, we could experience a material design, testing, or manufacturing failure in our products, a quality system failure, failures in our products and other challenges that are associated with our inability to properly manage changes in the suppliers and components that we use in our products, insufficient testing procedures, other safety issues, or heightened regulatory scrutiny that could warrant a recall of some of our products. A recall of some of our products could also result in increased product liability claims. Unforeseen product quality and/or product liability problems in the development and production of new and existing products could also result in loss of market share, decreased demand, reduced sales, rework costs, and higher warranty expense.\nWe are also subject to other litigation from time to time that could adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results or financial condition.\nIf we are unable to retain our executive officers or other key employees, attract and retain other qualified personnel, or successfully implement executive officer, key employee or other personnel transitions, we may not be able to meet strategic objectives and our business could suffer.\nOur ability to meet our strategic objectives and otherwise grow our business will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our leadership team. Our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to identify, attract, engage, train, and retain other highly qualified personnel worldwide, including in particular managerial, functional support, technical, sales and marketing, operations, and customer service personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not succeed in identifying, attracting, or retaining qualified personnel. The loss or interruption of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the inability to identify, attract, or retain qualified personnel in the future, the inability to successfully implement executive officer, key employee or other personnel transitions, delays in hiring qualified personnel, inability to hire necessary office or production employees due to low unemployment conditions or otherwise, or any employee work slowdowns, strikes, or similar actions could make it difficult for us to conduct and manage our business and meet key objectives, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are dependent upon the availability of floor plan financing, including through our Red Iron financing joint venture with TCFIF or otherwise, to provide competitive\ninventory financing programs to certain distributors and dealers of our products. Any material change in the availability or terms of credit offered to our customers by our floor plan arrangements, challenges or delays in transferring new distributors and dealers from any business we might acquire or otherwise to available floor plan platforms, any termination or disruption of our floor plan arrangements, or any delay in securing replacement credit sources could adversely affect our net sales and operating results.\nWe are a party to various floor plan arrangements, including a financing joint venture with TCFIF and TCFCFC, for the primary purpose of providing reliable, competitive floor plan financing to certain of our distributors and dealers primarily in the U.S. and Canada, as applicable, to support their businesses, as well as to improve our working capital for our other strategic purposes. As a result, we are dependent upon such arrangements for our inventory financing programs.\nThe availability of financing from our floor plan arrangements will be affected by many factors, including, among others, the overall credit markets, the credit worthiness of our dealers and distributors, and regulations that may affect such financing providers. Any material change in the availability or terms of credit offered to our customers by our floor plan financing providers, challenges or delays in transferring new distributors and dealers from any business we might acquire or otherwise to our available financing platforms, any termination or disruption of our floor plan arrangements, or any delay in securing replacement credit sources could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nThe terms of our credit arrangements and the indentures governing our senior notes and debentures could limit our ability to conduct our business, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions. Additionally, we are subject to counterparty risk in our credit arrangements.\nOur credit arrangements and the indentures governing our 3.81 percent Series A Senior Notes, 3.91 percent Series B Senior Notes, 6.625 percent senior notes, and 7.8 percent debentures include a number of financial and operating restrictions. For example, our credit arrangements contain financial covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. Our credit arrangements and/or indentures also contain provisions that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate liens or other encumbrances on our assets;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations; and\n\u2022\npay dividends that are significantly higher than those currently being paid, make other distributions to our shareholders, or redeem shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions may limit our ability to conduct our business, take advantage of business opportunities, and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions. In addition, they may place us at a competitive disadvantage\nrelative to other companies that may be subject to fewer, if any, restrictions or may otherwise adversely affect our business. Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as significant acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of the lenders under our credit arrangements, which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.\nAlthough we have in place a $600.0 million revolving credit facility that does not expire until June 2023, market deterioration or other factors could jeopardize the counterparty obligations of one or more of the banks participating in our revolving credit facility, which could have an adverse effect on our business if we are not able to replace such revolving credit facility or find other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms.\nIf we are unable to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements and indentures, especially the financial covenants, our credit arrangements could be terminated and our senior notes, debentures, and any amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility could become due and payable.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements, senior notes, and indentures, particularly the financial covenants. Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results. Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements, senior notes, and/or indentures. If we were out of compliance with any covenant required by our credit arrangements following any applicable cure periods, the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver. The banks could condition such waiver on amendments to the terms of our credit arrangements that may be unfavorable to us. In addition, our 3.81 percent Series A Senior Notes, 3.91 percent Series B Senior Notes, 6.625 percent senior notes, and 7.8 percent debentures, and any amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility could become due and payable if we were unable to obtain a covenant waiver or refinance our debt under our credit arrangements. If our debt rating falls below investment grade and/or our leverage ratio rises above 1.50, the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility could increase, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our cost of funding and/or adversely affect our access to capital markets or the availability of funding from a variety of lenders.\nOur credit ratings are important to our cost and availability of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate our credit profile and assign credit ratings to us. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. The addition of further leverage to our capital structure could result in a downgrade to our credit ratings in the future. For instance, if our credit rating falls below investment grade and/or our leverage ratio rises above 1.50, the interest rate we currently\npay on outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility could increase. As such, failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funding and our liquidity by limiting the access to capital markets or the availability of funding from a variety of lenders.\nWe are expanding and renovating our corporate and other facilities and could experience disruptions to our operations in connection with such efforts.\nWe are expanding and renovating our corporate and other facilities, primarily driven by our need to expand the capacity available for our manufacturing operations and office space. These expansion efforts include expanding and/or renovating certain of our facilities, such as our Tomah, Wisconsin manufacturing facility and Plymouth, Wisconsin warehouse. We financed, and expect to continue to finance, such efforts with cash on hand and cash from operating activities. The expansion and renovation of our corporate and other facilities entail risks that could cause disruption in the operations of our business. Such risks include potential interruption in manufacturing processes, delivery of raw materials, shipping finished goods, and data flow; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental, or geological problems; and unanticipated cost increases.\nWe may not achieve our projected financial information or other business initiatives in the time periods that we anticipate, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe generally provide projected financial information, such as our expected revenue growth and net earnings per share. These financial projections are based on management\u2019s current assumptions and expectations. The failure to achieve our financial projections could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also set goals and objectives for the timing of certain accomplishments, initiatives and milestones regarding our business or operating results. Whether we achieve our goals and objectives of such initiatives can vary due to a number of factors, including the risk factors described in this report. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in achieving the goals and objectives of our initiatives in the time periods that we anticipate, or ever. The failure to achieve such goals and objectives in the time periods that we anticipate, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 60580, "SIC": 3523, "TIC": "TTC"}
