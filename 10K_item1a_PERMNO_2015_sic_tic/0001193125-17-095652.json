{"cik": "1599891", "company": "Sunshine Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves certain risks. The following risk factors, as well as other information contained in this report, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes should be carefully considered. The following factors affect our business, the industry in which we operate and our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or which we consider immaterial as of the date hereof may also have an adverse effect on our business. If any of the matters discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans generally carry greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one-to-four family real estate, and these risks will increase if we succeed in our plan to increase these types of loans.\nAt December 31, 2016, $457.0 million, or 66.5%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one-to-four family real estate. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. These loans also have greater credit risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans for the following reasons:\n\u2022\ncommercial real estate and multi-family loans - repayment is generally dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.\n\u2022\ncommercial business loans - repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business.\nIf loans that are collateralized by real estate or other business assets become troubled and the value of the collateral becomes significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses, which would in turn adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have a high concentration of loans in a small geographic market area, which makes our business highly susceptible to downturns in the local economies and depressed banking markets, which could be detrimental to our financial condition.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, we are a community banking franchise concentrated in Central Florida. As of December 31, 2016, almost all of the loans in our loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live and/or conduct business in Central Florida and almost all of our loans were secured by real estate or other assets located in that market area. Deterioration in local economic conditions in the real estate market could have a material adverse effect on the quality of our portfolio by eroding the loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio, the demand for our products and services, the ability of borrowers to timely repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. In addition, if the population or income growth in the region is slower than projected, income levels, deposits and real estate development could be adversely affected and could result in the curtailment of our expansion, growth and profitability. If any of these developments were to result in losses that materially and adversely affected the Bank\u2019s capital, we might be subject to regulatory restrictions on operations and growth and required to raise additional capital.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAt December 31, 2016, $155.3 million, or 22.6%, of our total loan portfolio was secured by one-to-four family real estate. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. The decline in residential real estate values as a result of the downturn in the Florida housing market between 2008 and 2011 reduced the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans. Future declines could cause certain of our residential mortgage loans to be secured by liens on mortgage properties in which the borrowers may have little or no equity. As a result, we have increased risk that we could incur losses if borrowers default on their loans because we may be unable to recover all or part of the defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, they may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds.\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduced demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nNationally, economic growth has been slow and uneven. A return to deteriorating economic conditions or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets could significantly affect our customers\u2019 operations, the value of our loans and investments, and the demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values.\nNet income is the amount by which net interest income and noninterest income exceeds noninterest expense and the provision for loan losses and income taxes. Net interest income makes up a majority of our income and is the difference between:\n\u2022\ninterest income we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\n\u2022\ninterest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nWe are vulnerable to changes in interest rates, including the shape of the yield curve, because of a mismatch between the terms to maturity and repricing of our assets and liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, our net interest margin was 3.53% and 3.66%, respectively. Changes in interest rates also can affect: (i) our ability to originate loans; (ii) the value of our interest-earning assets; (iii) our ability to obtain and retain deposits; and (iv) the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, particularly adjustable rate loans.\nHistorically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nIn recent years it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. As a result, market rates on the loans we have originated and the yields on securities we have purchased have been at lower levels compared to those that existed prior to 2008. As of December 30, 2016, 78.3% of our deposit balances do not have stated maturities. Our non-maturity deposits and time deposits may reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets. Our ability to lower our interest expense on deposits may be limited at these current low interest rate levels while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease. The Federal Reserve Board may continue to maintain low interest rates. Accordingly, our net interest income (the difference between interest income we earn on our assets and the interest expense we pay on our liabilities) may continue to decrease, which will have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur financial performance will be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our growth strategy and manage our growth.\nOur current growth strategy is to grow organically and through select acquisitions. Our ability to grow organically depends primarily on generating loans and deposits of acceptable risk and expense, and we may not be successful in continuing this organic growth. Our ability to identify and consummate appropriate acquisitions, depends upon prevailing economic conditions, availability of sufficient capital, our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, competitive factors and changes in banking laws, among other factors. Sustaining our growth will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our firm and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we grow too quickly and are unable to control costs and maintain asset quality, such growth, whether organic or through select acquisitions, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may make future acquisitions, which may be restricted by applicable regulation, difficult to integrate, divert management resources, result in unanticipated costs, or dilute our stockholders.\nPart of our business strategy is to make acquisitions of, or investments in, companies that complement our current position or offer growth opportunities. Federal and Florida state banking laws restrict the activities that the Company and the Bank may lawfully conduct, whether directly or indirectly through acquisitions, subsidiaries and certain interests in other companies. These laws also affect the ability to effect a change of control of the Company or another savings and loan holding company. Our acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval. We may not receive regulatory approval for future acquisitions or, if received, such regulatory approval may not be timely. Changes in the number or scope of permissible activities under applicable law could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy.\nFurthermore, future acquisitions could pose numerous risks to our operations, including:\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty integrating the purchased operations;\n\u2022\nwe may incur substantial unanticipated integration costs;\n\u2022\nassimilating the acquired businesses may divert significant management attention and financial resources from our other operations and could disrupt our ongoing business;\n\u2022\nacquisitions could result in the loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired operations;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty retaining or developing the acquired businesses\u2019 customers;\n\u2022\nacquisitions could adversely affect our existing business relationships with customers;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to effectively compete in the markets serviced by the acquired bank;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to realize the potential cost savings or other financial benefits and/or the strategic benefits of the acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nwe may incur liabilities from the acquired businesses and we may not be successful in seeking indemnification for such liabilities or claims.\nIn connection with these acquisitions or investments, we could incur debt, amortization expenses related to intangible assets or large and immediate write-offs, assume liabilities, or issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership. We may not be able to complete acquisitions or integrate the operations, products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease.\nLending is inherently risky and we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may default on their obligations. A borrower\u2019s default on its obligations may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management\u2019s time and resources to the collection and work-out of the loan. In certain situations, where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work-out arrangements cannot be reached, we may have to charge-off the loan in whole or in part. In such situations, we may acquire real estate or other assets, if any, that secure the loan through foreclosure or other similar available remedies, and the amount owed under the defaulted loan may exceed the value of the assets acquired.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate other factors including, among other things, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance, which could materially decrease our net income.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and, based on their judgments and information available to them at the time of their review, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. An increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may reduce our net income and our capital, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nAt December 31, 2016, our nonperforming assets, which consist of non-performing loans and other real estate owned, were approximately $291,000, or 0.03% of total assets. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways:\n\u2022\nwe record interest income only on the cash basis or cost-recovery method for non-accrual loans and we do not record interest income for other real estate owned;\n\u2022\nwe must provide for probable loan losses through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses;\n\u2022\nnoninterest expense increases when we write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values;\n\u2022\nthere are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees; and\n\u2022\nthe resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activity.\nIf additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our nonperforming assets, our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur small size makes it more difficult for us to compete.\nOur small asset size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions which are generally larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. In addition, our smaller customer base makes it difficult to generate meaningful noninterest income. Finally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the ongoing increased costs of compliance with banking and other regulations.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that may benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued industry consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services than we can as well as better pricing for those products and services.\nWe have more limited resources than many of our competitors to invest in technology.\nOur industry is experiencing rapid technological change. These new technologies are often designed to provide better customer service as well as cost reduction. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to enhance customer convenience while operating more efficiently. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. If we are unable to effectively implement new technological developments on pace with our competitors, our competitive position may be harmed.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. As a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our clients\u2019 information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation, or damage to our reputation.\nSuch fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyberattacks. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents in recent periods. Moreover, recently, several large corporations, including retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, where in some cases, exposing sensitive financial and other personal information of their clients and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with the Bank.\nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on our networks and systems, those of our clients and certain of our third party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients\u2019 confidence. Increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, the inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business, and/or our ability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or exposure to civil litigation or possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMore generally, publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-based applications or solutions as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Such publicity may also cause damage to our reputation as a financial institution. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by disruptions to our network and computer systems or to those of our service providers as a result of denial-of-service or other cyber-attacks.\nWe may experience disruptions or failures in our computer systems and network infrastructure or in those of our service providers as a result of coordinated denial-of-service or other cyber-attacks in the future. Due to the increasing sophistication of such attacks, we may not be able to prevent denial-of-service or other cyber-attacks that could compromise our normal business operations, compromise the normal business operations of our clients, or result in the unauthorized use of clients\u2019 confidential and proprietary information. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of network and computer systems resulting from denial-of-service or other cyber-attacks could damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations and we could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe depend upon the services of the members of our senior management team to implement our business strategy and execute our operations. Accordingly, our success and future growth depend upon the continued success of our management team, in particular our Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Samuel, and other key employees. Members of our senior management team and lending personnel who have expertise and key business relationships in our markets could be difficult to replace. The loss of these persons or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to compete.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank and our reputation is one of the most valuable assets of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe face reputation and business risks due to our interactions with business partners, service providers and other third parties.\nWe rely on third parties in a variety of ways, including to provide key components of our business infrastructure or to further our business objectives. These third parties may provide services to us and our clients or serve as partners in business activities. We rely on these third parties to fulfill our obligations, to accurately inform us of relevant information and to conduct our activities professionally and in a manner that reflects positively on us. Any failure of these business partners, service providers or other third parties to meet their commitments to us or to perform in accordance with our expectations could result in operational issues, increased expenditures, and damage to our reputation or loss of clients, which could harm our business and operations, financial performance, strategic growth and reputation.\nIn recent years regulators have increased scrutiny of financial institutions\u2019 relationships with third parties. If our activities, policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or inappropriate, or those of third parties with whom we have a relationship are deemed deficient or inappropriate, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our permitted activities.\nIn particular, we receive core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems, deposit processing, wire processing and other processing services from third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we were able to replace them, it may be at higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and results of operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other adverse weather events, terrorist activities or by international hostilities.\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential impact of natural disasters, terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted. Our market area is susceptible to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, other severe weather events and related flooding and wind damage. These natural disasters could negatively impact regional economic conditions, disrupt operations, cause a decline in the value or destruction of mortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures or loss on loans originated by us, damage our banking facilities and offices, result in a decline in local loan demand and our loan originations and negatively impact our growth strategy. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that natural disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in a particular region. We cannot predict whether or to what extent future natural disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of natural disasters.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to us. We require sufficient liquidity to meet our expected financial obligations, as well as unexpected requirements stemming from client activity and market changes.\nThe Company manages liquidity using several liquidity key risk indicators measured at the Bank. The key risk indicators include, but are not limited to, the loan to deposit ratio, the ratio of non-reciprocal brokered deposits to total deposits, and the ratio of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings to total assets. As of December 31, 2016, these ratios were 94.8%, 7.0%, and 9.9%, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, Sunshine Bank had outstanding advances with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\u201cFHLB\u201d) of $65.0 million. The FHLB advance is secured by a blanket lien on loans with a remaining credit availability of approximately $52.8 million, collateralized by real estate loans.\nAn inability to maintain or raise funds through these sources could have a substantial negative effect on us. Access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on attractive terms, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include an increase in costs of capital in financial capital markets, a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, or a decrease in depositor or investor confidence. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe volatility or disruption of financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Any failure to manage our liquidity effectively could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations of enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, payment processors, and other institutional clients, which may result in payment or delivery obligations to us or to our clients due to products arranged by us. Many of these transactions expose us to credit, market and execution risk as a result of possible counterparty or client default. In addition, the Bank is exposed to market risk when the collateral it holds cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the secured obligation. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur internal control systems could fail to detect certain events.\nWe are subject to operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors and client or employee fraud. We maintain a system of internal controls designed to mitigate against such occurrences and maintain insurance coverage for such risks. However, should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls, uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued and may continue to issue accounting standards that adversely impact the earnings and capital of the Company.\nThe bodies responsible for establishing or interpreting accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes may be hard to predict and may materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nOn June 16, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-13, Current Expected Credit Loss Standard (\u201cCECL\u201d) that will impact the methodology used to estimate the allowance for loan and lease losses. Although the new standard does not become effective for several years, the impact of CECL may not be estimable for some time. Furthermore, the FASB may issue additional accounting standards that may adversely impact the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nFinancial reform legislation will result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our cost of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has changed the bank regulatory framework. For example, it has created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, established more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies and gives the Federal Reserve Board exclusive authority to regulate savings and loan holding companies. The legislation has also resulted in new regulations affecting the lending, funding, trading and investment activities of banks and bank holding companies. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as Sunshine Bank, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. Banks and savings institutions with $10.0 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings and loan associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business will not be known until all of the regulations implementing the statute are adopted and implemented. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act will impact our business, operations or financial condition. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has the power to adopt new regulations to protect consumers and exercise control over existing consumer protection regulations adopted by federal banking regulators. The Volcker Rule, a component of the Dodd-Frank Act, generally prohibits the Company from engaging in proprietary trading and having ownership interests in, or acting as sponsors to, certain hedge funds and private equity funds, activities that, in prior regulatory regimes, might have generated higher returns on capital. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may require us to make changes to our business and operations and will likely result in additional costs and divert management\u2019s time from other business activities, any of which may adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn 2013, the OCC adopted final rules to update the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule applies to all depository institutions, and top-tier bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more.\nThe final rule includes minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015, and refined the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The minimum capital requirements under the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms are as follows: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. For 2017, the capital conservation buffer is 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III has impacted the competitive investment and deposit gathering strategies of larger financial institutions that may have a collateral impact on our Bank.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and, to a lesser extent, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Such regulators govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a financial institution, the classification of assets by a financial institution, and the adequacy of a financial institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation could have a material impact on us and our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and applicable regulations are subject to regular modification and change. Laws, rules and regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.\nBanking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we become subject as a result of such examinations could materially and adversely affect us.\nFederal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. Accommodating such examinations may require management to reallocate resources, which would otherwise be used in the day-to-day operation of other aspects of our business. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, allowance for loan losses, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us, our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, we could be materially and adversely affected.\nFlorida financial institutions face a higher risk of noncompliance and enforcement actions with respect to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nLike all U.S. financial institutions, we are subject to monitoring requirements under federal law, including anti-money laundering, or AML, and Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, matters. Since September 11, 2001, banking regulators have intensified their focus on AML and BSA compliance requirements, particularly the AML provisions of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. Moreover, we operate in areas designated as High Intensity Financial Crime Areas and High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas. Since 2004, federal banking regulators and examiners have been extremely aggressive in their supervision and examination of financial institutions located in the State of Florida with respect to institutions\u2019 BSA and AML compliance. Consequently, a number of formal enforcement actions have been issued against Florida financial institutions. Although we have adopted policies, procedures and controls to comply with the BSA and other AML statutes and regulations, this aggressive supervision and examination and increased likelihood of enforcement actions may increase our operating costs, which could negatively affect our results of operation and reputation.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief and imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and state and federal law could prevent or impede the ability of stockholders to obtain representation on our board of directors, and may discourage hostile acquisitions of control of the Company, which could negatively affect our stock value.\nCertain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage attempts to acquire the Company, pursue a proxy contest for control of the Company, assume control of the Company by a holder of a large block of common stock, or remove the Company\u2019s management, all of which stockholders might think are in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nrestrictive requirements regarding eligibility for service on the board of directors, age requirements, a prohibition on service by persons who are or have been the subject of certain legal or regulatory proceedings, a prohibition on service by persons who are party to agreements that may affect their voting discretion, and a prohibition on service by nominees or representatives (as defined in applicable Federal Reserve Board regulations) of another person who would not be eligible for service or of an entity the partners or controlling persons of which would not be eligible for service;\n\u2022\nthe election of directors to staggered terms of three years;\n\u2022\nprovisions requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u2022\na limitation on voting rights of persons who directly or indirectly beneficially own more than 10% of the outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022\na prohibition on cumulative voting;\n\u2022\na requirement that the calling of a special meeting by stockholders requires the request of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting;\n\u2022\na requirement that directors may only be removed for cause and by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board;\n\u2022\nthe board of directors\u2019 ability to cause the Company to issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to amend and repeal the bylaws and the required stockholder vote to amend or repeal the bylaws;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to consider a variety of factors in evaluating offers to purchase or acquire the Company; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement of the vote of 80% of the votes entitled to be cast in order to amend certain provisions of the articles of incorporation, including those set forth above.\nFederal regulations prohibit for three years following the completion of a mutual-to-stock conversion, the offer to acquire or the acquisition of more than 10% of any class of equity security of the Bank or the Holding Company without prior regulatory approval. In addition, the business corporation law of Maryland, the state where the Company is incorporated, provides for certain restrictions on acquisition of the Company.\nA significant percentage of our common stock is held or controlled by our directors and executive officers and benefit plans.\nOur board of directors and executive officers collectively own approximately 9.3% and our employee stock ownership plan (\u201cESOP\u201d) owns approximately 4.2% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The ownership by executive officers, directors and our ESOP could result in actions being taken that are not in accordance with other stockholders\u2019 wishes, and could prevent any action requiring a supermajority vote under our articles of incorporation and bylaws (including the amendment of certain protective provisions of our articles and bylaws discussed immediately above).\nWe have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets, including our stock in the Bank, to secure that debt.\nWe have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets to secure that debt. Absent special and unusual circumstances, a holder of indebtedness for borrowed money has rights that are superior to those of holders of common stock. For example, interest must be paid to the lender before dividends can be paid to the stockholders, and loans must be paid off before any assets can be distributed to stockholders if we were to liquidate. Furthermore, we would have to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce our profitability or result in net losses on a consolidated basis even if the Bank were profitable.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we decide to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock could be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as modified by the JOBS Act. We are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure about our executive compensation and omission of compensation discussion and analysis, and an exemption from the requirement of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. In addition, we will not be subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, including the additional level of review of our internal control over financial reporting that may occur when outside auditors attest to our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years from the completion of the conversion, or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, (b) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. Taking advantage of any of these exemptions may adversely affect the value and trading price of our common stock.\nWe have elected to delay the adoption of new and revised accounting pronouncements, which means that our financial statements may not be comparable to those of other public companies.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we have elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.", "PERMNO": 14829, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "SBCP"}
