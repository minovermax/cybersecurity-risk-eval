{"cik": "65270", "company": "METHODE ELECTRONICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-06-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain statements in this report are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We undertake no duty to update any such forward-looking statements to conform to actual results or changes in our expectations. Our business is dependent upon two large automotive customers and specific makes and models of automobiles. Our results will be subject to many of the same risks that apply to the automotive, appliance, commercial vehicle, computer and communications industries, such as general economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations, consumer spending patterns and technological changes. Other factors which may result in materially different results for future periods include the following risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that our management currently believe to be insignificant may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this report because these factors could cause our actual results and condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this report are subject to the safe harbor protection provided under the securities laws and are made as of the date of this report.\nThe effects of a pandemic or widespread outbreak of an illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has had and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19, or other public widespread outbreak of an illness, poses the risk that we, our employees, our suppliers, our customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.\nWhile we have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect our fiscal 2021 results of operations to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact on our business will depend on a number of evolving factors, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, as well as the possibility of the pandemic re-occurring, actions taken by governmental authorities to restrict certain business operations and social activity and impose travel restrictions, the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and whether recessionary conditions will persist, consumer demand, the ability of our supply chain to deliver in a timely and cost-effective manner, the ability of our employees and manufacturing facilities to operate efficiently and effectively, the continued viability and financial stability of our customers and suppliers and future access to capital, all of which remain uncertain. As a result, the magnitude and duration of the impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition cannot be determined at this time.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive, commercial vehicle, appliance, computer and communications industries and are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur components are found in the primary end-markets of the automotive, commercial vehicle, communications (including information processing and storage, networking equipment, wireless and terrestrial voice/data systems), aerospace, rail and other transportation industries, appliances, consumer and industrial equipment markets, and medical device markets. Factors negatively affecting these industries also negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any adverse occurrence, including industry slowdown, recession, rising interest rates, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers\u2019 production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Automotive segment has been adversely impacted by disruptions caused to the global automotive industry by the COVID-19 pandemic. Global vehicle production has decreased, and some vehicle manufacturers have completely shut down manufacturing operations in some countries and regions, including the United States and Europe. As a result, we have\nexperienced, and are likely to continue to experience, delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales. If the global economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continue or increase, overall customer demand may continue to decrease which could have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is dependent on sales to GM and Ford. If we were to lose either of these customers or experienced a significant decline in the volume or price of products purchased by these customers, or if either of the customers declared bankruptcy, our future results could be adversely affected.\nDuring fiscal 2020, sales to GM and Ford, or their tiered suppliers, represented 26.8% and 10.7%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. The sales to GM primarily consisted of integrated center consoles for use in light trucks and SUV's, and a shift in consumer preference for smaller or more fuel-efficient vehicles could adversely affect our results of operations. The sales to Ford consist of ambient lighting, overhead consoles and other integrated modules, including control panels. The arrangements with these customers generally provide for supplying the customers\u2019 requirements for particular models, rather than for manufacturing a specific quantity of products. Such supply arrangements cover a period from one year to the life of the model, which is generally three to seven years. Therefore, the loss of a GM or Ford supply arrangement for a model or a significant decrease in demand for one or more of these models could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We also compete to supply products for successor models and are subject to the risk that GM or Ford will not select us to produce products on any such model, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our sales to GM and Ford, can be impacted by work stoppages, such the United Auto Workers (\u201cUAW\u201d) labor strike at GM in the fall of 2019. This labor strike at GM adversely impacted our results of operations in fiscal 2020.\nInternational trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect our business.\nTariffs could increase the cost of our products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross profit margin that we earn on sales of our products. Tariffs could also make our products more expensive for customers, which could make our products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit our ability to offer our products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect our business.\nAny changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \"trade wars.\"\nAny changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \"trade wars,\" which could increase costs for goods imported into the United States. This increase in costs may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices, or if trading partners limit their trade with the United States. If these consequences are realized, the volume of economic activity in the U.S., including demand for our products, may be materially reduced. Such a reduction may materially and adversely affect our sales and our business.\nOur inability, or our customers' inability, to effectively manage the timing, quality and cost of new program launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn connection with the awarding of new business, we obligate ourselves to deliver new products and services that are subject to our customers' timing, performance and quality demands. Additionally, we must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order for the program launches of certain of our products to be successful. Given the complexity of new program launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers' introduction of new products. Our inability, or our customers' inability, to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices.\nOver the past several years we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, pressure to lower our prices. We, from time to time, provide price concessions in connection with the awarding of new business. In order to maintain our profitability, we must strive to increase volumes and reduce our costs. Continuing pressures to reduce our prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to attract and retain qualified personnel could affect our results.\nOur success, both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions, depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate a highly-skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver growth objectives and execute our strategy. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily upon engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees could hinder our ability to conduct research activities successfully and develop marketable products.\nOur Dabir Surfaces medical device products are emerging technologies. Our ability to successfully market and sell these products will depend on acceptance by the medical community.\nWe continue to develop our Dabir Surfaces medical device products, which are included in several ongoing clinical research and product evaluation studies. We will not be successful in marketing and selling these products to the medical community if we are unable to demonstrate the clinical efficacy, cost effectiveness and distinctive benefits of the products or if our customers prefer competitive products.\nA significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in a currency other than the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries are reported in current period income. In the future, unfavorable changes in exchange rate relationships between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and their non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. While we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk through operational means by matching revenue with same-currency costs, this may not always be effective. We currently do not use third-party derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk of transactional currency fluctuations. As a result, significant fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular against the value of the U.S. dollar, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to currency translation risk as we are required to translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. We report the effect of translation for our foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Unfavorable changes in the exchange rate relationship between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the United States.\nInternational operations represent a significant portion of our business. Sales outside the U.S. represent a material amount of our consolidated net sales, and we expect net sales outside the U.S. to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net sales. Outside of the U.S., we operate manufacturing facilities in Belgium, Canada, China, Egypt, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nOur international operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign regulations and expose us to a variety of domestic and foreign political, economic and other risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in international trade and investment policies, including restrictions or taxes on the repatriation of dividends or other funds, new or higher tariffs, duties or customs (for example, on products imported from Mexico or China), new barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements and changes to, or withdrawals from, free trade agreements;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign or domestic government leadership;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign or domestic laws or regulations impacting our overall business model or restricting our ability to manufacture, purchase or sell our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in domestic or foreign tax laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates;\n\u2022\neconomic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations, such as China, Egypt, Malta and Mexico;\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate with the effect of competition from new market entrants;\n\u2022\nuncertainty related to the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union;\n\u2022\nimpact of compliance with U.S. and other foreign countries\u2019 export controls and economic sanctions;\n\u2022\nliabilities resulting from U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations and union relationships;\n\u2022\nlogistical and communications challenges; and\n\u2022\ndiffering protections for our intellectual property.\nAny of these factors may have an adverse effect on our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to costs associated with environmental, health and safety regulations.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our current and former operations and facilities have been, and are being, operated in compliance, in all material respects, with such laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. The operation of our manufacturing facilities entails risks in these areas, however, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or other pertinent requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future by governmental authorities.\nShould a catastrophic event or other significant business interruption occur at any of our facilities, we could face significant reconstruction or remediation costs, penalties, third party liability and loss of production capacity, which could adversely affect our business.\nWeather conditions, natural disasters or other catastrophic events could cause significant disruptions in operations, including, specifically, disruptions at our manufacturing facilities or those of our major suppliers or customers. In turn, the quality, cost and volumes of the products we produce and sell could be unexpectedly, negatively affected, which would impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us, our suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing partners and customers. Our business operations could be subject to interruption by power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to produce and deliver products to our customers, or to receive components from our suppliers, thereby creating delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, we could be negatively affected by shutdowns, shelter in place orders, more stringent travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services,\ngovernmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, and disruptions in the operations of our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. The majority of our research and development activities, our corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing partners, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, losses could be incurred and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. While we may purchase insurance policies to cover the direct economic impact experienced following a natural disaster occurring at one of our own facilities, there can be no assurance that such insurance policies will cover the full extent of our financial loss nor will they cover losses which are not economic in nature such as, for example, our reputation as a reliable supplier.\nImpairment charges relating to our goodwill and long-lived assets could adversely affect our financial statements.\nA significant portion of our long-term assets consists of goodwill and long-lived assets recorded as a result of past acquisitions. We do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather review them for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If such circumstances or conditions exist, further steps are required in order to determine whether the carrying value of each of the individual assets exceeds its fair market value. If our analysis indicates that an individual asset\u2019s carrying value does exceed its fair market value, the next step is to record a loss equal to the excess of the individual asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value.\nIn evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization.\nWe also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate our long-lived assets may be impaired. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.\nIn the event that we determine that our goodwill or long-lived assets are impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our future projections, which may increase the requirement to record an impairment.\nOur inability to capitalize on prior or future acquisitions or any decision to strategically divest one or more current businesses may adversely affect our business.\nWe have completed acquisitions and divestitures in the past and we may continue to seek acquisitions to grow our businesses or divest operations to focus on our core businesses. We may fail to derive significant benefits from such transactions. Also, if we fail to achieve sufficient financial performance from an acquisition, certain long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, could become impaired and result in the recognition of an impairment loss.\nThe success of our acquisitions depends on our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully execute the integration or consolidation of the acquired operations into our existing businesses;\n\u2022\ndevelop or modify the financial reporting and information systems of the acquired entity to ensure overall financial integrity and adequacy of internal control procedures;\n\u2022\nfinance the acquisition;\n\u2022\nidentify and take advantage of cost reduction opportunities; and\n\u2022\nfurther penetrate new and existing markets with the product capabilities we may acquire.\nIntegration of acquisitions may take longer than we expect and may never be achieved to the extent originally anticipated. Acquisitions may also increase our debt levels. This could result in lower than expected business growth or higher than anticipated costs. In addition, acquisitions or strategic divestitures may:\n\u2022\ncause a disruption in our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ncause dilution of our common stock;\n\u2022\ndistract our management; or\n\u2022\nunduly burden other resources in our company.\nOur ability to market our automotive and commercial vehicle products is subject to a lengthy sales cycle, which requires significant investment prior to significant sales revenues, and there is no assurance that our products will be implemented in any particular vehicle.\nThe sales cycles for our automotive and commercial vehicle products are lengthy because the manufacturers must develop high degrees of assurance that the products they buy will meet customer needs, interface as easily as possible with the other parts of a vehicle and with the manufacturer\u2019s production and assembly process, and have minimal warranty, safety and service problems. As a result, from the time that a manufacturer develops a strong interest in our products, it normally will take several years before our products are available to consumers in that manufacturer\u2019s vehicles.\nIn the automotive components industry, products typically proceed through five stages of research and development. Initial research on the product concept comes first, to assess its technical feasibility and economic costs and benefits. This stage often includes development of an internal prototype for the component supplier\u2019s own evaluation. If the product appears feasible, the component supplier manufactures a functioning prototype to demonstrate and test the product\u2019s features. These prototypes are then marketed and sold to automotive companies for testing and evaluation. If an automobile manufacturer shows interest in the product, it typically works with the component supplier to refine the product, then purchases second and subsequent generation engineering prototypes for further evaluation. Finally, the automobile manufacturer either decides to purchase the component for a production vehicle or terminates the program.\nThe time required to progress through these five stages to commercialization varies widely. Generally, the more a component must be integrated with other vehicle systems, the longer the process takes. Further, products that are installed by the factory usually require extra time for evaluation because other vehicle systems are affected, and a decision to introduce the product into the vehicle is not easily reversed. Because our automotive products affect other vehicle systems and are a factory-installed item, the process usually takes several years from conception to commercialization.\nWhile we currently have active development programs with various OEMs for a variety of our products, no assurance can be given that our products will be implemented in any particular vehicles. During this development process, we derive minimal funding from prototype sales but generally obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. If our products are not selected after a lengthy development process, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOther automotive and commercial vehicle products that we develop are also likely to have a lengthy sales cycle. Because such technology is new and evolving, and because customers will likely require that any new product we develop pass certain feasibility and economic viability tests before committing to purchase, it is expected that any new products we develop will take some years before they are sold to customers, if at all.\nWe are dependent on the availability and price of materials.\nWe require substantial amounts of materials, including application-specific integrated circuits, coil and bar stock, ferrous and copper alloy sheets, glass, LED displays, plastic molding materials, precious metals, and silicon die castings. The availability and prices of materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and worldwide\nprice levels. Any change in the availability of, or price for, these materials could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability, and that of our suppliers, business partners and contract manufacturers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at our facilities, or other reasons, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nOur judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes may impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine our effective tax rate and evaluate our tax positions. We provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards. Fluctuations in federal, state and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. Additionally, we are subject to audits in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Based on the status of these audits and the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant tax authorities, it is not possible to estimate the impact of changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Any negative or unexpected outcomes of these examinations and audits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may adversely impact our results of operations.\nA number of factors may increase our effective tax rate, which could reduce our net income, including:\n\u2022\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\nadjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n\u2022\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets;\n\u2022\nchanges in available tax credits;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws or interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of non-U.S. income and expenses; and\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nWe may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe technologies relating to some of our products have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, rapid and significant changes. Specifically, end-markets for electronic components and assemblies are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards. These changes could render our existing products unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and other expenses. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products vary, may change and are difficult to estimate. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations could be negatively impacted by service interruptions, data corruption or misuse, cyber-based attacks, or network security breaches.\nWe face certain security threats relating to the confidentiality and integrity of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. Despite implementation of security measures, our IT systems may be vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, cyber-attacks and other unauthorized access, and these security breaches could result in a disruption to our operations. A material network breach of our IT systems could involve the theft of our and our customers' intellectual property or trade secrets which may be used by competitors to develop competing products. To the extent that any security breach results in a loss or damage to data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our customer relations, lead to claims against us, increase our costs to protect against future damage and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nAny such disruption or security breach, as well as any action by us or our employees or contractors that might be inconsistent with the rapidly evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations applicable within the U.S. and elsewhere where we conduct business, could result in enforcement actions by U.S. states, the U.S. Federal government or foreign governments, liability or sanctions under data privacy laws that protect personally identifiable information, regulatory penalties, other legal proceedings such as but not limited to private litigation, the incurrence of significant remediation costs, disruptions to our development programs, business operations and collaborations, diversion of management efforts and damage to our reputation, which could harm our business and operations. Because of the rapidly changing nature of technology and the increasing sophistication of cybersecurity threats, our measures to prevent, respond to and minimize such risks may be unsuccessful. While we have secured cyber insurance to potentially cover certain risks associated with cyber incidents, there can be no assurance the insurance will be sufficient to cover any such liability.\nThe General Data Privacy Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) of the European Union creates a range of compliance obligations applicable to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer of personal data in the European Union. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the U.S., enhances enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance.\nProducts we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us.\nDespite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to a variety of factors, including design or manufacturing errors, component failure or counterfeit parts. Product defects may result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects may result in product liability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products that are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability, however, we do not have coverage for all costs related to product defects or recalls and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage.\nReorganization activities may lead to additional costs and material adverse effects.\nIn the past, we have taken actions to restructure and optimize our production and manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies through relocations, consolidations, plant closings or asset sales. In the future, we may take additional restructuring actions including the consolidating, closing or selling of additional facilities. These actions could result in impairment charges and various charges for such items as idle capacity, disposition costs and severance costs, in addition to normal or attendant risks and uncertainties. We may be unsuccessful in any of our current or future efforts to restructure or consolidate our\nbusiness. Plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during restructuring or consolidation may not be achieved. These activities may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur technology-based businesses and the markets in which we operate are highly competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively, our sales could decline.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes due to technological improvements and developments. We compete with a large number of other manufacturers in each of our product areas and many of these competitors have greater resources and sales. Price, service and product performance are significant elements of competition in the sale of our products. Competition may intensify further if more companies enter the markets in which we operate. Our failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, on another person\u2019s intellectual property, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have numerous U.S. and foreign patents and license agreements covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes. Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology. Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under numerous patents in the U.S. and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued. The loss of certain patents and trade secrets could adversely affect our sales, margins or profitability.\nWe have and may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringe on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay a penalty for past infringement and spend significant time and money to develop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation.\nWe cannot guarantee that the recently acquired Grakon businesses will be successful or that we can implement and profit from any new applications of the acquired technology.\nWe acquired Grakon Parent, Inc. (\u201cGrakon\u201d) on September 12, 2018. As a result, we now manufacture LED-based lighting in North America and Asia, which are expected to aid in our expansion in the automotive and commercial vehicle sectors. The markets for the products these companies produce are competitive and rapidly changing. If we do not keep pace with technological innovations in the industry, our products may not be competitive, and our revenue and operating results may suffer. Furthermore, while we intend to expand these businesses by integrating the acquired technologies into additional automotive and other applications, we can make no guarantee that such ventures will be successful or profitable.\nPerformance-based stock awards under our long-term incentive plan have required significant adjustments to compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income. Any future performance-based stock awards issued under our long-term incentive plan could require similar adjustments. The adjustments could be material our financial statements.\nIn general, performance-based stock-based compensation expense under our long-term incentive plans is \u200erecognized over the vesting \u200eperiod based on the projected probability of achievement of the \u200ethreshold, target or maximum performance level. In each \u200eperiod, the stock-based compensation \u200eexpense may be adjusted, as necessary, in response to changes in\nour \u200eforecast with \u200erespect to the performance level. If required, we will record additional compensation \u200eexpense, or a reversal of compensation expense, relating to prior periods. The stock-based \u200ecompensation expense adjustments could be \u200ematerial to the financial statements.\u200e\nWe have incurred a significant amount of indebtedness, and our level of indebtedness and restrictions under our indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic could also adversely impact our liquidity.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility. Our senior unsecured credit agreement consists of a $200.0 million revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million term loan. On March 23, 2020, we drew down $100.0 million under the revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the current uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As of May 2, 2020, $339.7 million in principal was outstanding under these financing arrangements and we had $91.4 million of availability remaining under the revolving credit facility. The term loan matures in September 2023 and requires quarterly principal payments of $3.1 million over the five-year term, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The senior unsecured credit agreement provides for variable rates of interest based on the type of borrowing and our debt to EBITDA financial ratio and contains customary representations and warranties, financial covenants, restrictive covenants and events of default.\nFurther, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused significant uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets. Our senior unsecured credit agreement provides an option to increase the size of our revolving credit facility and term loan by an additional $200.0 million, subject to customary conditions and approval of the lenders providing the new commitments. There can be no assurance that lenders will approve additional commitments under current circumstances. As a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to raise additional capital and our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, and our prospects.\nOur senior unsecured credit agreement imposes various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of our business, including covenants that require us to obtain the lenders\u2019 consent before we can, among other things and subject to certain exceptions: (i) incur additional indebtedness or additional liens on our property; (ii) consummate certain acquisitions, dispositions, mergers or consolidations; (iii) make any material change in the nature of our business; (iv) enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; or (v) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of our common stock or pay cash dividends to our stockholders when a default exists or certain financial covenants are not maintained.\nThe amount of our outstanding indebtedness could have an adverse effect on our operations and liquidity, including by, among other things: (i) making it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions, because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make our scheduled debt payments; (ii) causing us to use a larger portion of our cash flows to fund interest and principal payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, product development, capital expenditures and other business activities; (iii) making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities or other strategic transactions, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and (iv) limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund the activities and expenditures described above and for other general corporate purposes as and when needed, which could force us to suspend, delay or curtail business prospects, strategies or operations.\nThe replacement or modification of LIBOR as a reference rate could increase our interest expense in the future.\nThe London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. LIBOR is currently used as the reference rate on our senior unsecured credit agreement, which matures in September 2023. Currently, no replacement rate has been identified. The transition from LIBOR could result in higher interest expense than has historically been recognized.", "PERMNO": 53197, "SIC": 3678, "TIC": "MEI"}
