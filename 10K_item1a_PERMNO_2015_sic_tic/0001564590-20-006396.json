RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the specific risks set forth below and other matters described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties that impact the business environment generally, those not presently known to us, or those that we currently see as immaterial, may also harm our business. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCurrent and future economic conditions could materially adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur success depends significantly upon discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by a number of general economic factors, including without limitation economic growth, consumer confidence, the housing market, employment and income levels, interest rates, inflation, taxation, consumer shopping trends and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. Adverse trends in any of these economic factors may adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur future growth and profitability depend upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing programs.\nWe are highly dependent on the effectiveness of our marketing messages and the efficiency of our advertising expenditures in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products. We continue to evolve our marketing strategies, adjust our messages, the amount we spend on advertising and where we spend it. We may not always be successful in developing effective messages, as the consumer and competition change, or in achieving efficiency in our advertising expenditures.\nWe rely in part upon third parties, such as social media influencers and athletes, to market our brand, and we are unable to fully control their efforts. Influencers and athletes with whom we maintain a relationship could engage in behavior or use their platforms to communicate directly with our customers in a manner that reflects poorly on our brand and may be attributed to us or otherwise adversely affect us. It is not possible to prevent such behavior, and the precautions we take to detect or prevent this activity may not be effective.\nConsumers are increasingly using digital tools as a part of their shopping experience. As a result, our future growth and profitability will depend in part on (i) the effectiveness and efficiency of our online experience, including without limitation advertising and search optimization programs, in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products; (ii) our ability to prevent confusion among consumers that can result from search engines that allow competitors to use our trademarks to direct consumers to competitors\u2019 websites through confusing or misleading advertisements; (iii) our ability to prevent Internet publication of false or misleading information regarding our products or our competitors\u2019 products; (iv) reviews of our products; (v) the nature and tone of consumer sentiment, including those published online or elsewhere; and (vi) the stability of our website. In recent periods, competitor spending on Internet-based marketing programs has increased, including without limitation from a number of direct-to-consumer, Internet-based retailers, which has and may continue to increase the cost of basic search terms and the cost of our Internet-based marketing programs.\nIf our marketing messages are ineffective or our advertising expenditures and other marketing programs, including digital programs, are inefficient in creating awareness and consideration of our products and brand name, and in driving consumer traffic to our website or stores, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted. In addition, if we are not effective in preventing the publication of confusing, false or misleading information regarding our brand or our products, or if there is publication online or elsewhere of significant negative consumer sentiment regarding our Company, brand or our products, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nOur future growth and profitability depend on our ability to execute our Company-Controlled distribution strategy.\nThe vast majority of our sales occur through our Company-Controlled distribution channels, including our retail stores and our website. These Company-Controlled distribution channels represent our largest opportunity for growth in sales and improvement in profitability. Our retail stores carry significant fixed costs. We also make significant capital expenditures as we open new stores and remodel or reposition existing stores. We are highly dependent on our ability to maintain and increase sales per store to cover these fixed expenses, provide a return on our capital investments and improve our operating margins.\nMany of our stores are mall-based. We depend on the continued popularity of malls as shopping destinations and the ability of mall anchor tenants and other attractions to generate customer traffic for our mall-based retail stores. Any decrease in mall traffic could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur Company-Controlled distribution strategy results in relatively few points of distribution, including 611 retail stores in 50 U.S. states as of the end of 2019 and our website. Several of the mattress manufacturers and retailers with which we compete have significantly more points of distribution than we do, which makes us highly dependent on our ability to drive consumers to our points of distribution to gain market share.\nOur longer-term Company-Controlled distribution strategy is also dependent on our ability to renew existing store leases and to secure suitable locations for new store openings, in each case on a cost-effective basis. We may encounter higher than anticipated rents and other costs in connection with managing our retail store base. We may also be unable to find or obtain suitable new locations.\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product quality could negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur products are highly differentiated from traditional innerspring mattresses and from viscoelastic and other foam mattresses, which have little or no technology and do not rely on electronics and air control systems. As a result, our beds may be susceptible to failures that do not exist with traditional or foam mattresses. Failure to achieve and maintain acceptable quality standards could impact consumer acceptance of our products or result in negative media and Internet reports or owner dissatisfaction that could negatively impact our brand image and sales levels.\nIn addition, a decline in product quality could result in an increase in return rates and a corresponding decrease in sales, or an increase in product warranty claims in excess of our warranty reserves. An unexpected increase in return rates or warranty claims could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs a consumer innovation company with differentiated products, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims or regulatory actions if the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in personal injury or property damage. If any of our products proves to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products. We have at times experienced increased returns and adverse impacts on sales, as well as product liability litigation, as a result of media reports related to the alleged propensity of our products to develop mold. We may experience additional adverse impacts on sales and additional litigation if any similar media reports were to occur in the future. We maintain insurance against some forms of product liability claims, but such coverage may not be applicable to, or adequate for, liabilities actually incurred. A successful claim brought against us outside of, or in excess of, available insurance coverage, or any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity about us, may have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur future growth and profitability depend in part on our ability to continue to improve and expand our product line and to successfully execute new product introductions.\nAs described in greater detail below, the bedding industry, as well as the market for sleep monitoring products, are both highly competitive, and our ability to compete effectively and to profitably grow our market share depend in part on our ability to continue to improve and expand our product line of adjustable firmness air beds, SleepIQ technology and related accessory products. We incur significant research and development and other expenditures in the pursuit of improvements and additions to our product line. If these efforts do not result in meaningful product improvements or new product introductions, or if we are not able to gain widespread consumer acceptance of product improvements or new product introductions, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, if any significant product improvements or new product introductions are not successful, our reputation and brand image may be adversely affected.\nSignificant competition could adversely affect our business.\nBecause of the vertical integration of our business model, our products and distribution channels face significant competition from both manufacturers of different types of mattresses and a variety of retailers. Our SleepIQ technology also faces significant competition from various manufacturers and retailers of sleep tracking and monitoring products.\nThe mattress industry is characterized by a high degree of concentration among the largest manufacturers of innerspring mattresses and foam mattresses and one dominant national mattress retailer. Many newer competitors in the mattress industry have begun to offer \u201cbed-in-a-box\u201d or similar products directly to consumers through the Internet and other distribution channels. The emergence of these new competitors has significantly increased the costs of search terms and digital advertising.\nA variety of sleep tracking and monitoring products that compete with our SleepIQ technology have been introduced by various manufacturers and retailers, both within and outside of the traditional mattress industry.\nSome of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and manufacturing resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and sell products through broader and more established distribution channels. Our national, exclusive distribution competes with other retailers who generally provide a wider selection of mattress alternatives than we offer. A number of these retailers also have more points of distribution, greater marketing resources, and greater brand name recognition than we do.\nThese manufacturing and retailing competitors, or new entrants into the market, may compete aggressively and gain market share with existing or new products, and may pursue or expand their presence in the adjustable firmness air bed segment of the market as well as in the market for sleep tracking and monitoring products. We have limited ability to anticipate the timing and scale of new product introductions, advertising campaigns or new pricing strategies by our competitors, which could inhibit our ability to retain or increase market share, or to maintain our profit margins.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete with other manufacturers and retailers of mattress and sleep tracking and monitoring products, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nOur intellectual property rights may not prevent others from using our technology or trademarks in connection with the sale of competitive products. We are from time to time subject to claims that our products, processes or trademarks infringe intellectual property rights of others.\nWe own various U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to certain elements of the design and function of our beds and related products. We own numerous registered and unregistered trademarks and trademark applications, including in particular our Sleep Number, Sleep Number 360, 360, and SleepIQ trademarks, as well as other intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, trade dress and copyrights, which we believe have significant value and are important to the marketing of our products. These intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection against infringement or piracy, may not prevent competitors from developing and marketing products that are similar to or competitive with our beds or other products, and may be costly and time-consuming to protect and enforce. Our patents are also subject to varying expiration dates. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property, we may be unable to prevent other companies from using our technology or trademarks in connection with competitive products, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are from time to time subject to claims that our products, processes, advertising, or trademarks infringe the intellectual property rights of others. The defense of these claims, even if we are ultimately successful, may result in costly litigation, and if we are not successful in our defense, we could be subject to injunctions and liability for damages or royalty obligations, and our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA reduction in the availability of credit to consumers generally or under our existing consumer credit programs could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nA significant percentage of our sales are made under consumer credit programs through third parties. The amount of credit available to consumers may be adversely impacted by macroeconomic factors that affect the financial position of consumers and as suppliers of credit adjust their lending criteria.\nSynchrony Bank provides credit to our customers through a private label credit card agreement that is currently scheduled to expire on December 31, 2023, subject to earlier termination upon certain events. Synchrony Bank has discretion to control the content of financing offers to our customers and to set minimum credit standards under which credit is extended to customers.\nReduction of credit availability due to changing economic conditions, changes in credit standards under our private label credit card program or changes in regulatory requirements, or the termination of our agreement with Synchrony Bank, could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe could be vulnerable to shortages in supply of components necessary to manufacture our products due to our manufacturing processes which operate with minimal levels of inventory or due to global shortages of supply of electronic componentry or other materials, which may harm our ability to satisfy consumer demand and may adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nA significant percentage of our products are assembled after we receive orders from customers utilizing manufacturing processes with minimal levels of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventories. Lead times for ordered components may vary significantly, and some components used to manufacture our products are provided on a sole source basis. In addition, with the increasing prevalence of and consumer demand for electronic products, the global supply of electronic componentry is increasingly strained, which may lead to shortages in supply and increased prices. Any unexpected shortage of materials caused by any disruption\nor unavailability of supply or an unexpected increase in the demand for our products, could lead to delays in deliveries of our products to customers and increased costs. Any such delays could adversely affect our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe rely upon several key suppliers and third parties that are, in some instances, the only source of supply or services currently used by us for particular materials, components or services. A disruption in the supply or substantial increase in cost of any of these products or services could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe currently obtain all the materials and components used to produce our beds from outside sources including some that are located outside the United States. In several cases, including our air chambers, integrated non-adjustable foundations, adjustable foundations, various components for our Firmness Control\u2122 systems, certain foam formulations, as well as our fabrics and zippers, we have chosen to obtain these materials and components from suppliers who serve as the only source of supply, or who supply the vast majority of our needs of the particular material or component. While we believe that these materials and components, or suitable replacements, could be obtained from other sources in the event of a disruption or loss of supply, we may not be able to find alternative sources of supply or alternative sources of supply on comparable terms. If our relationship with the primary supplier of our air chambers or the supplier of our adjustable foundations is terminated, we could have difficulty in replacing these sources since there are relatively few other suppliers presently capable of manufacturing these components.\nSimilarly, we rely on third parties to deliver some of our products to our facilities and customers on a timely and cost-effective basis. These third-party providers could be vulnerable to labor shortages, liquidity concerns or other factors that may result in delays in deliveries or increased costs of deliveries. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns and cause us to lose sales. Any increase in freight charges or other costs of deliveries could increase our costs of doing business and harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nFluctuations in commodity prices or third-party logistics costs could result in an increase in component costs and/or delivery costs.\nOur business is subject to significant increases or volatility in the prices of certain commodities, including but not limited to electronic componentry, fuel, oil, natural gas, rubber, cotton, plastic resin, steel and chemical ingredients used to produce foam, as well as third-party logistic costs. Increases in prices of these commodities or logistics costs or other inflationary pressures may result in significant cost increases for our raw materials and product components, as well as increases in the cost of delivering our products to our customers. To the extent we are unable to offset any such increased costs through value engineering and similar initiatives, or through price increases, our profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted. If we choose to increase prices to offset the increased costs, our sales volumes could be adversely impacted.\nOur business is subject to risks inherent in global sourcing activities.\nOur air chambers and some of our other components are manufactured outside the United States, and therefore are subject to risks associated with foreign sourcing of materials, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nExisting or potential duties, tariffs or quotas on certain types of goods that may be imported into the United States;\n\u2022\nPolitical instability resulting in disruption of trade;\n\u2022\nDisruptions in supply or transportation due to acts of terrorism, outbreaks of pandemics or contagious diseases (such as the recent coronavirus), shipping delays, foreign or domestic strikes, customs inspections or other factors;\n\u2022\nForeign currency fluctuations; and\n\u2022\nEconomic uncertainties, including inflation.\nWe cannot predict whether the countries in which some of our components are manufactured, or may be manufactured in the future, will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. The United States government has commenced certain trade policies, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from China and other countries, and may take further actions with respect to these policies in the future. As we source some of our components from China, any tariffs or other trade restrictions impacting the import of those components from China may have a material adverse impact on us. These factors could increase our costs of doing business with foreign suppliers, lead to inadequate inventory levels or delays in shipping beds to our customers, which could harm our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nDisruption of operations in our main manufacturing facilities or assembly facilities could increase our costs of doing business or lead to delays in shipping our beds.\nWe have two main manufacturing plants, which are located in Irmo, South Carolina and Salt Lake City, Utah. We have several assembly distribution centers, which assemble the final mattress product before delivery to the customer, across the US. A significant\npercentage of our products are assembled to fulfill orders rather than stocking finished goods inventory in our plants or stores. Therefore, the disruption of operations of either of our two main manufacturing plants or our assembly distribution centers for a significant period of time may increase our costs of doing business and lead to delays in deliveries of our products to customers. Such delays could adversely affect our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to a wide variety of government laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, as well as any new or changed laws or regulations, could disrupt our operations or increase our compliance costs. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have further adverse impact.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations relating to the bedding industry or to various aspects of our business. Laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels frequently change and we cannot always reasonably predict the impact from, or the ultimate cost of compliance with, future regulatory or administrative changes. Changes in law, the imposition of new or additional regulations or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, advertising and marketing practices, pricing, consumer credit offerings, product testing and safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, accounting, privacy and data security, health and safety or environmental issues, among others, could require us to change the way we do business and could have a material adverse impact on our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. New or different laws or regulations could increase direct compliance costs for us or may cause our vendors to raise the prices they charge us because of increased compliance costs. Further, the adoption of a multi-layered regulatory approach to any one of the state or federal laws or regulations to which we are currently subject, particularly where the layers are in conflict, could require alteration of our manufacturing processes or operational parameters which may adversely impact our business.\nLegislative or regulatory changes that impact our relationship with our workforce, such as minimum wage requirements or health insurance or other employee benefits mandates, could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. While it is our policy and practice to comply with legal and regulatory requirements and our procedures and internal controls are designed to promote such compliance, we cannot assure that all of our operations will comply with all such legal and regulatory requirements. Further, laws and regulations change over time and we may be required to incur significant expenses and/or to modify our operations in order to ensure compliance. This could harm our profitability or financial condition. If we are found to be in violation of any laws or regulations, we could become subject to fines, penalties, damages or other sanctions as well as potential adverse publicity or litigation exposure. This could adversely impact our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows or financial condition.\nRegulatory requirements related to flammability standards for mattresses may increase our product costs and increase the risk of disruption to our business.\nCompliance with the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission flammability standards and related regulations for mattresses and mattress and foundation sets has resulted in higher materials and manufacturing costs for our products, and has required modifications to our information systems and business operations, further increasing our costs and negatively impacting our capacity.\nThese regulations require manufacturers to implement quality assurance programs and encourage manufacturers to conduct random testing of products. These regulations also require maintenance and retention of compliance documentation. These quality assurance and documentation requirements are costly to implement and maintain. If any product testing, other evidence, or regulatory inspections yield results indicating that any of our products may not meet the flammability standards, we may be required to temporarily cease production and distribution and/or to recall products from the field, and we may be subject to fines or penalties, any of which outcomes could harm our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nPending or unforeseen litigation and the potential for adverse publicity associated with litigation could adversely impact our business, reputation, financial results or financial condition.\nWe are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including primarily commercial, product liability, employment and intellectual property claims. We currently do not expect the outcome of any pending matters to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Litigation, however, is inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that the ultimate outcome of one or more pending claims asserted against us, or claims that may be asserted in the future that we are currently not aware of, or adverse publicity resulting from any such litigation, could adversely impact our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nAny improvements or upgrades to our information systems that may be required to meet the evolving needs of our business as well as existing and emerging regulatory requirements may be costly to implement and may take longer or require greater resources than anticipated, and may result in disruptions to our systems or business.\nWe depend on our information systems for many aspects of our business. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented a new ERP system and continue to implement operational improvements to our information systems. If our information systems are disrupted in any material way, or improvements or upgrades are required to meet the evolving needs of our business and existing and emerging regulatory requirements, we may be required to incur significant capital expenditures in the pursuit of improvements or upgrades to our information systems. These efforts may take longer and may require greater financial and other resources than anticipated, may cause distraction of key personnel, and may cause short-term disruptions to our existing systems and our business. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to achieve critical strategic initiatives and could adversely impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nInformation systems that contain confidential Company data, consumers\u2019 private data, and team members\u2019 private data may be subject to attacks by hackers or other cyber threats that could compromise the security of the data, which could substantially disrupt our business and could result in a breach of the data.\nOur information systems and information systems of third-party vendors we use to assist in the storage and management of information contain personal information related to our customers and team members in the ordinary course of our business, such as credit card and demographic information of our customers, SleepIQ data, including biometric data, from our customer base and social security numbers and demographic information of our team members. These information systems also contain confidential Company data regarding our business and innovations. While we maintain and require our third-party vendors to maintain security measures to protect this information, a breach of these security measures, such as through third-party action, team member error, malfeasance or otherwise, could compromise the security of our data and customers\u2019 and team members\u2019 personal information. As the techniques used to breach such security measures change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Any failure of our systems and processes or our third-party vendors\u2019 systems and processes to adequately protect our data or customer or team member personal information from theft or loss could adversely impact our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur future growth and profitability depend in part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nAs a vertically integrated manufacturer and retailer, our future growth and profitability will depend in part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel in a wide variety of areas to execute our growth strategy, including qualified management and executive personnel and qualified retail sales professionals and managers. The failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and growth initiatives and may adversely impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 86489, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "SNBR"}
