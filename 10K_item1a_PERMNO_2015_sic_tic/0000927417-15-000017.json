{"cik": "927417", "company": "POLYMER GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are risks and uncertainties that, if they were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations or could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements made by us.\nBondholders and prospective investors should carefully consider and evaluate all of the risk factors described below. These risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended, supplemented, or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the future.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nThe specialized markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive, as a result we may have difficulty growing our business and maintaining profit margins.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive. The primary competitive factors include product innovation and performance, quality, service, cost, distribution and technical support. In addition, we compete against a number of competitors in each of our markets. Some of these competitors are larger companies that have greater financial, technological, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. A reduction in overall demand, a significant increase in manufacturing capacity in excess of demand or increased costs to design and produce our products would likely further increase competition and that increased competition could lead to reduced sales or cause us to reduce our prices, which could lower our profit margins and impair our ability to grow.\nThe global nonwovens market has historically experienced stable growth and favorable pricing dynamics. However, since late 2010, several of our competitors, primarily in the hygiene markets, installed or announced an intent to install, capacity in excess of what we believe to be current market demand in the regions that we conduct business. As additional nonwovens manufacturing capacity entered into commercial production, in excess of market demand, the short-term to mid-term excess supply created unfavorable market dynamics, resulting in a downward pressure on selling prices. In recent years, we believe growing demand has filled a portion of this excess capacity and we have observed fewer new capacity expansions, leading to improved capacity utilization in our view.\nIncreases in prices for raw materials and energy could reduce our profit margins.\nThe primary raw materials used to manufacture most of our products are polypropylene resins (accounting for approximately 75% of raw material costs historically), polyester fiber, polyethylene resin and, to a lesser extent, rayon and tissue paper. In addition, energy-related costs are a significant expense for us (both directly and as inputs to our primary raw materials). The prices of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial changes due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions, currency fluctuations, political unrest and instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. To the extent that we are able to pass along raw material price increases to some of our customers, there is often a delay between the time we are required to pay the increased raw material price and the time we are able to pass the increase on to our customers. To the extent we are not able to pass along all or a portion of such increased prices of raw materials, our cost of goods sold would increase and our operating income and margins would correspondingly decrease. There can be no assurance that the prices of raw materials and energy will not increase in the future or that we will be able to pass on any increases to our customers. In addition, volatility in the prices for raw materials could make it more difficult for us to pass along all or a portion of any increase to our customers. Material increases in raw material and energy prices that cannot be passed on to customers could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe industries that we serve are subject to the overall economic environment and demand for end-use products.\nOur net sales are affected by general economic conditions, and the development of demand for and prices of end-use products in the industries that we serve. Geographically, general economic conditions constitute important factors affecting the demand for our products. Our results may also be affected by the cyclicality of the end-uses applications and industries we serve, although these cycles vary across industries and geographic regions. Demand for and prices of our products have fluctuated during the past years as demand by end-users and intermediate converters has changed. A substantial decline in general economic conditions combined with a consequent decline in the prices and/or demand for our products could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe loss of any of our large volume customers could significantly reduce our revenues and profits.\nA significant amount of our products are sold to large volume customers. We have one major customer, Procter & Gamble, that accounts for approximately 12% of our business and our 20 largest customers represented approximately 51% of our sales in\n2014. We also do not have any long-term volume commitments with our customers and, as a result, the amount, and prices at which, our customers purchase from us may vary across periods. As a result, a decrease in business from, or the loss of any large volume customers, could materially reduce our product sales, lower our profits and impair our financial condition.\nOur international operations pose risks to our business that may not be present with our domestic operations.\nOur manufacturing facilities in the United States accounted for approximately 33% of net sales for 2014, with facilities in Mexico, Canada, Europe, Asia and South America accounting for approximately 67% of net sales for the same period. As a result of the Provid\u00eancia Acquisition, we have further strengthened our presence in South America and we expect a proportionate increase to our net sales in that region. As part of our growth strategy, we have expanded, and may continue to expand operations in foreign countries where we have an existing presence or enter new foreign markets and expect to increase sales of products as disposable income increases in developing markets. Our foreign operations are, and any future foreign operations will be, subject to certain risks that are unique to doing business in foreign countries. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, economic or political instability, shipping delays in both our products and receiving delays of raw materials, changes in applicable laws, including assessments of income and non-income related taxes, reduced protection of intellectual property and regulatory policies and various trade restrictions including potential changes to export taxes or countervailing and anti-dumping duties for exported products from these countries. Any of these risks could have a negative impact on our ability to deliver products to customers on a competitive and timely basis. This could reduce or impair our net sales, profits, cash flows and financial position. We have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency risk except for risk associated with certain capital spending projects or acquisitions.\nWe may not realize certain productivity enhancements or improvements in costs.\nAs part of our business strategy, we must continuously identify opportunities to improve profitability by reducing costs and enhancing productivity to improve our results. Any cost savings or productivity enhancements that we realize from such efforts may differ materially from our estimates. We cannot assure you that these initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that the benefits we expect will be achieved on a timely basis or if they will be achieved at all. If we are unable to reduce costs or improve productivity, our competitive position and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced losses in the past, and we may experience similar losses in the future.\nFor each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 we experienced net losses. Please see the section under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for a discussion of our operational history and the factors accounting for such losses. We cannot assure you that in the future we will be profitable.\nWe generate most of our revenue from the sale of manufactured products that are used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial applications and the potential for product liability exposure could be significant.\nWe manufacture a wide variety of products that are used in consumer and industrial applications, such as disposable diapers, baby wipes, surgical gowns, wound dressings, carpet backing and industrial packaging. As a result, we may face exposure to product liability claims in the event that the failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to make warranty payments or to participate in a recall of those products.\nThe future costs associated with defending product liability claims or responding to product warranty claims could be material and we may experience significant losses in the future as a result. A successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in any product recall could substantially reduce our profitability and cash generated from operations.\nReductions in our selling prices to customers could reduce our profit margins.\nIn cases where changes in our selling prices to customers are determined via contract based on changes in an underlying raw material price index, such as the index for polypropylene, and the index decreases, sales would decrease and our operating income would correspondingly decrease if we are not able to obtain corresponding reductions in our raw material costs. Such decreases in operating income could be material. There can be no assurance that the index used in such contracts will not decrease in the future or that we will be able to obtain corresponding reductions in our raw material costs. Additionally, unfavorable competitive dynamics could cause us to lower our selling prices without a change in raw material cost.\nDelay in the procurement of raw materials could reduce our revenues and profits.\nIn certain regions of the world, we may source certain key raw materials from a limited number of suppliers or on a sole source basis. To the extent that we cannot procure our raw material requirements from a local country supplier, we seek to import raw materials from outside refiners. The loss of any of our key suppliers or the delay in the import of raw materials could, in the short-term, adversely affect our business until alternative supply arrangements are secured and the respective suppliers are qualified with our customers, or until importation delays of raw material are resolved. Accordingly, a delay in the procurement of raw materials could reduce product sales, lower our profits and impair our financial condition.\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nAny of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines or equipment within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\n\u2022unscheduled maintenance outages;\n\u2022prolonged power failures;\n\u2022an equipment failure;\n\u2022a chemical spill or release;\n\u2022labor difficulties;\n\u2022disruptions in transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;\n\u2022fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;\n\u2022terrorism or threats of terrorism;\n\u2022governmental regulations; and\n\u2022other operational problems.\nFor example, on May 15, 2014, Provid\u00eancia announced that production on three of its spunmelt lines at its S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais facility had been partially interrupted. The interruption was the result of an order by the Brazilian Ministry of Labor, pending remedial action by Provid\u00eancia to bring the facility into compliance with applicable Brazilian workplace safety regulations. The shutdown impacted sales volumes in excess of 6,500 metric tons of nonwovens during the 2014 fiscal year. Any such future disruption could prevent us from meeting customer orders, reduce our sales or profits and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must continue to invest significant resources in developing innovative products in order to maintain a competitive edge in the highly specialized markets in which we operate.\nOur continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain our technological capabilities and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize innovative products for the nonwoven and oriented polymer industries. We must also protect the intellectual property rights underlying our new products to realize the full benefits of our efforts. If we fail to continue to develop products or to keep pace with technological developments by our competitors, we may lose market share, reduce product sales and lower our margins which would impair our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to utilize our production capacity efficiently due to variability in customer demand or unexpected events.\nOur ability to utilize our production capacity efficiently may be affected by variability in customer demand or interruptions in production. We have a relatively versatile production base with 22 production facilities worldwide, which facilitates effective use of capacity by, for example, allowing for the redirection of resources to reflect changes in demand. Any interruption in production at our production sites, whether due to lack of orders, labor action, environmental incidents, breakdown of major production machines, fire, accidents or other factors, has the potential to affect adversely our ability to meet production goals for the year and result in lost business opportunities in the future. Also, any failure to fill customer orders on schedule could lead customers to seek alternative sources of supply.\nWe typically only produce goods against orders received, rather than for stock. Although we believe that close customer relationships have helped us to make accurate estimates of future orders in the past, there could be significant or numerous reductions, delays or cancellations in anticipated or confirmed orders by a customer or group of customers in the future, which could cause us to incur downtime on our machines and thereby have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nBecause a significant number of our employees are represented by labor unions or trade councils and work under collective bargaining agreements, any employee slowdown or strikes or the failure to renew our collective bargaining agreements could disrupt our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 49% of our employees were represented by labor unions or trade councils and worked under collective bargaining agreements, all of which expire within one year. We may not be able to maintain constructive relationships with these labor unions or trade councils. We may not be able to successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms in the future. The loss of a substantial number of these employees or a prolonged labor dispute could disrupt our business. Any such disruption could reduce our revenues, increase our costs and result in significant losses.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide raw materials, significant machinery and components used in our production facilities. A material interruption in supply or delivery could prevent or limit our ability to accept and fill orders for our products.\nWe currently depend upon a limited number of outside unaffiliated suppliers for key machinery and components used in our manufacturing and converting facilities. We cannot produce most of our nonwoven and oriented polyolefin products within the specifications required by our customers without such key machinery and components. If any of our suppliers cease to provide new machinery and components or replacement parts for existing machinery and components in sufficient quantity to meet our needs, there may not be adequate alternative sources of supply. To date, we have been able to obtain the required machinery and components to allow us to expand our business and supply products to our customers within their required specifications without any significant delays or interruptions. Obtaining alternative sources of such machinery and components could involve significant delays and other costs, and these supply sources may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. In some cases, we expect that it would take several months, or longer, for a new supplier to begin providing machinery and components to specification. Any disruption of machinery and component supplies could result in lost or deferred sales which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe purchase raw materials from an array of suppliers, some of which supply a significant portion of our raw materials. A loss of a significant supplier could cause us to experience substantial production delays and may impact our business and financial results. We use third-party transportation providers for our shipment of raw materials and our final products, including shipment tracking and freight dispatch services. Our use of transportation services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. Any material shipping interruptions can adversely affect our ability to meet our production goals or result in significant additional costs.\nWe could be subject to substantial costs to comply with, and liabilities under, environmental laws, and violations of such laws may increase costs or require us to change certain business practices.\nWe use and generate a variety of chemicals in our manufacturing operations and we are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These environmental laws govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, storage, disposal and release of wastes and hazardous substances, cleanup of contaminated sites and human health and safety. We regularly incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, and such costs could increase significantly, or our business or operations could be materially affected, with changes in legal requirements or their interpretation or enforcement. For example, certain local governments have adopted ordinances prohibiting or restricting the use or disposal of certain plastic products, such as certain of the plastic wrapping materials that we produce. Widespread adoption of such prohibitions or restrictions could adversely affect demand for our products and thereby have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, a decline in consumer preference for plastic or disposable products due to environmental considerations could have a material adverse effect upon us. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up and capital costs, fines and sanctions and third-party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations of environmental laws. Failure to comply with environmental requirements could also result in enforcement actions that materially limit or otherwise affect our operations. We are also subject to laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, that may impose liability retroactively and without fault for releases or threatened releases of regulated materials at on-site or off-site locations.\nAdditionally, greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions have increasingly become the subject of a large amount of international, national, regional, state and local attention. Cap and trade initiatives to limit GHG emissions have been enacted in the European Union. Numerous bills related to climate change have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and various states and federal agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have taken or are considering actions to regulate GHG emissions, which could adversely impact us and many other industries including our suppliers or customers, which may result in higher costs or other impacts to our business. Within the U.S., most of these actions and proposals have resulted or would result in the regulation\nand/or taxation, in one fashion or another, of the production of carbon dioxide and other GHGs to facilitate the reduction of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use more clean energy.\nOur insurance policies may be insufficient to cover certain eventualities.\nWe have extensive insurance policies that we believe provide coverage consistent with industry practice. However, there is a possibility that these insurance policies may not adequately cover all risks and catastrophic events, and that any particular claim may not be paid. For example, in December 2010, a severe rainy season impacted many parts of Colombia and caused us to temporarily cease manufacturing at our Cali, Colombia facility due to a breach of a levy and flooding at the industrial park where our manufacturing facility is located. Although we carried flood insurance, it was insufficient to cover all of our losses and we incurred additional liability for costs associated with the flood and restoration of the facility. A catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events may cause large losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Natural catastrophic events to which we are exposed include fires, windstorms, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, severe hail, severe winter weather and floods, which are inherently unpredictable in terms of both their occurrence and severity. We are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events, which may have a significant adverse impact on the industry where we operate and our business.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we could lose a significant competitive advantage.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our technologies and products against competitive pressure and to defend our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market similar products, which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations. We consider our patents and trademarks, in the aggregate, to be important to our business and seek to protect our proprietary know-how in part through United States and foreign patent and trademark registrations. We have over 1,300 pending and approved trademark and domain name registrations worldwide and over 600 pending and approved patents worldwide, and maintain certain trade secrets. We may not receive patents for all our pending patent applications, and existing or future patents or licenses may not provide competitive advantages for our products. Our competitors may challenge, invalidate or avoid the application of any existing or future patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that we receive or license. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products. The loss of protection for our intellectual property could reduce the value of our products, reduce product sales, lower our profits, and impair our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to recover the carrying value of our long-lived assets, which could require us to record asset impairment charges and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nProperty, plant and equipment represent a significant portion of our assets. Restructuring initiatives and changing conditions can impact our ability to recover the carrying value of our long-lived assets. The continuing presence of these factors, as well as other factors, could require us to record asset impairment charges in future periods which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nGoodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In the future, goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of future acquisitions. We review goodwill and intangible assets at least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in performance, adverse competitive conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products and services we sell, challenges to the validity of certain registered intellectual property, reduced sales of certain products incorporating registered intellectual property, and a variety of other factors. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and may require the restatement of previously published financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities.\nWe recently identified an error in the accounting for noncontrolling interest in the financial statements of the Company for the unaudited interim periods ended June 28, 2014 and September 27, 2014 relating to our Provid\u00eancia Acquisition, which resulted in the restatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements for such periods. The error only impacted the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and certain footnote disclosures for such periods. The error\nhad no impact on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) or the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for such periods. As a result of the restatement, we concluded that we had a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, in the past we have identified and remediated material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of February 6, 2015, we implemented additional procedures that we believe are sufficient to remediate the existing material weakness. However, if we determine that these material weaknesses have not been fully remediated or if additional material weaknesses in our internal controls are discovered in the future, they may adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately and, as a result, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements.\nIn addition, it is possible that control deficiencies could be identified by our management or by our independent registered public accounting firm in the future or may occur without being identified. Such a failure could result in regulatory scrutiny, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported results, lead to a default under our indebtedness and otherwise materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe failure of our information technology systems could disrupt our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in, among other things, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of data and the loss of sales and customers, which could cause our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including, without limitation, fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failure, system conversions, security breaches, cyber-attacks, viruses and/or human error. In any such event, we could be required to make a significant investment to fix or replace information technology systems, and we could experience interruptions in our ability to service our customers. Any such damage or interruption could adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe loss of our senior management could disrupt our business.\nOur senior management is important to the success of our business. However, the specialty materials and nonwovens industries are characterized by significant competition for a limited pool of experienced executive personnel and, as a result, we may not be able to retain our existing senior management. In addition, we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover. The loss of any member of our senior management team without retaining a suitable replacement (either from inside or outside our existing management team) could restrict our ability to enhance existing products in a timely manner, sell products to our customers or manage the business effectively.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which requires significant interest and principal payments. As of December 31, 2014, our total long-term debt was $1,465.2 million. Our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes and the credit agreements governing the ABL Facility and the Term Loans contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nThe restrictions contained in the indentures and the credit agreements also will not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. In addition, our ABL Facility provided for unused commitments of $43.6 million (subject to availability under a borrowing base and after giving effect to $19.3 million of outstanding letters of credit) as of December 31, 2014. Furthermore, we may increase our commitments under our ABL Facility without the consent of lenders under our ABL Facility, other than those lenders who, in their discretion, issue a commitment to provide all or a portion of such increase, by up to an additional $75.0 million, subject to certain customary conditions, and available debt capacity under the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes and the credit agreement governing the Term Loans. To the extent new debt is added to our currently anticipated debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the previous risk factor would increase.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our ABL Facility, the Term Loans and certain of our foreign indebtedness are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nWe may be unable to service our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations.\nMoreover, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Unsecured Notes, the ABL Facility and the Term Loans, could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. The lenders under our ABL Facility could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder and cease making further loans. The lenders and holders of our secured debt could institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our ABL Facility to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our ABL Facility, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness and the Lease Agreements (as defined below) impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes, the credit agreements governing our ABL Facility, the Term Loans and the lease agreements associated with two of our U.S. spunmelt lines (the \"Lease Agreements\") impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock or enter into sale and leaseback obligations;\n\u2022\npay certain dividends or make certain distributions on our capital stock or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans, investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;\n\u2022\namend or otherwise alter the terms of our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nalter the business that we conduct;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations; and\n\u2022\ncreate liens.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in our ABL Facility and Lease Agreements may require us to maintain a specified financial ratio and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with those financial ratios and tests can be affected by factors beyond our control. As a result, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. Our failure to comply with the terms of the Lease Agreements could result in a default thereunder which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to make substantial unscheduled payments in respect of the applicable Lease Agreement. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants or could impact compliance with existing restrictive covenants.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our existing indebtedness and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nIf there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments.\nRisks Related to our Acquisitions\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions and dispositions.\nWe may pursue acquisitions or joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy. In pursuing these transactions, we may encounter significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on the investment made, that we increase our debt levels beyond what the acquired business can support, that we may incur unknown liabilities or that we experience difficulty in completing such transactions or in the integration of new operations, employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of management\u2019s attention from our other businesses. These factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nWe may, as part of our long-term business strategy, evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer be in alignment with our strategic direction. When we decide to sell assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the accomplishment of strategic objectives, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms which are less than optimal. In addition, there is a risk that we sell a business whose subsequent performance exceeds expectations, in which case the decision would have potentially sacrificed enterprise value. Alternatively, we may be too optimistic about a particular business\u2019s prospects, in which case we may be unable to find a buyer at an acceptable price or sacrifice enterprise value by retaining such business.\nOur recent acquisitions, including the Fiberweb Acquisition and Provid\u00eancia Acquisition, may not achieve their intended results, including anticipated cost savings.\nAlthough we completed the Fiberweb Acquisition and Provid\u00eancia Acquisition with the expectation that each transaction will result in various benefits, including a significant amount of cost savings and other financial and operational benefits, there can be no assurance regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize any of these benefits. Achieving the anticipated\nbenefits of an acquisition, including cost savings, is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses acquired can be operated in the manner we intend. The integration may be subject to delays or changed circumstances, and we can give no assurance that the acquired businesses will perform in accordance with our expectations or that our expectations with respect to integration or cost savings as a result of acquisitions will materialize. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs and charges in connection with integrating the acquired businesses, including severance payments and other restructuring and transitional charges. Additional unanticipated costs, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, or loss of customer and supplier relationships may also arise during the integration process. The integration of acquired businesses, including the Fiberweb and Provid\u00eancia businesses, may place an additional burdens on our management and internal resources, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention during the integration and restructuring process could have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Provid\u00eancia Acquisition exposes us to additional risks and uncertainties with respect to the acquired businesses and their operations.\nWe expect that the Provid\u00eancia Acquisition will re-balance our business mix to a greater percentage of international operations. The acquired businesses will generally be subject to risks similar to those that we are subject to in our existing international businesses. In addition, we will be subject to increased foreign currency exchange rate risks because a greater portion of our cash flows will be generated by our international business operations. These risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value of the Brazilian real and the U.S. dollar between the time we initially invest U.S. dollars in our Brazilian business and the time that cash is repatriated to the United States from Brazil. In addition, our consolidated reported earnings on a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) basis may be subject to increased currency translation risk, which is the result of the conversion of earnings as reported in our Brazilian businesses on a Brazilian real basis to a U.S. dollar basis in accordance with GAAP requirements. In addition, regulatory requirements, political and/or competitive conditions associated with aspects of the acquired businesses may differ from those of our existing business, which may increase our costs.\nIn connection with the Provid\u00eancia Acquisition, approximately R$106.9 million (or $47.9 million) of the total consideration due to the selling shareholders pursuant to the stock purchase agreement constitutes Deferred Purchase Price, payable to the selling shareholders to the extent the Provid\u00eancia Tax Claims are resolved in Provid\u00eancia\u2019s favor. See \u201cBusiness-Expansion and Optimization-Provid\u00eancia Acquisition.\u201d In addition, to the extent minority shareholders participate in the Mandatory Tender Offer, a pro rata amount of the consideration due to such tendering shareholders will be treated as Deferred Purchase Price with respect to such tendering holders. Based on currently available information, we do not anticipate that the actual tax liability will materially exceed the Deferred Purchase Price. However, the actual tax liability will be determined according to applicable Brazilian law, and to the extent the actual tax liability is in excess of the Deferred Purchase Price, we will be responsible for such excess.\nOur subsidiary Provid\u00eancia is a Brazilian company and may remain a public company following completion of the tender offer in Brazil.\nWe may not succeed in acquiring 100% of the share capital of Provid\u00eancia. If Provid\u00eancia remains a public company in Brazil, it will remain subject to Brazilian laws and regulations applicable to domestic public companies, including Brazilian Corporation Law and the Sao Paulo stock exchange listing requirements, some of which may differ from the legal principles and rules that would apply if Provid\u00eancia were incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. In addition, we will continue to incur costs and expenses associated with being a public company in Brazil.\nThe Provid\u00eancia business may also be adversely affected by any changes to Brazilian economic conditions. The Brazilian economy has historically been characterized by interventions by the Brazilian government and unstable economic cycles. The Brazilian government has often changed monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies. For example, the government\u2019s actions to control inflation have at times involved setting wage and price controls, blocking access to bank accounts, imposing exchange controls and limiting imports into Brazil. We have no control over, and cannot predict, what policies or actions the Brazilian government may take in the future. Provid\u00eancia\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected by, among others, the following factors:\n\u2022\nexchange rate movements;\n\u2022\nexchange control policies;\n\u2022\nexpansion or contraction of the Brazilian economy;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\ntax policies;\n\u2022\nother economic political, diplomatic and social developments in or affecting Brazil;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nenergy shortages or rationalization;\n\u2022\nliquidity of domestic capital and lending markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in environmental regulation; and\n\u2022\nsocial and political instability, particularly in light of recent protests against public policy and related vandalism in major Brazilian cities.\nThese factors, as well as uncertainty over whether the Brazilian government may implement changes in policy or regulations relating to these factors, may adversely affect Provid\u00eancia and its business and financial performance. The Brazilian government has considerable power to determine governmental policies and actions that relate to the Brazilian economy and, consequently, affect the operations and financial performance of businesses in Brazil. The government may face domestic pressure to retreat from the current macroeconomic policies in an attempt to achieve higher rates of economic growth. We cannot predict what policies will be adopted by the Brazilian government and whether these policies will negatively affect the economy or Provid\u00eancia\u2019s business or financial performance. In addition, uncertainty leading up to and after the election over whether the Brazilian government may implement changes in policy or regulations may contribute to economic uncertainty in Brazil.\nThe market for securities issued by Brazilian public companies is influenced, to varying degrees, by economic and market conditions in other emerging market countries, especially other Latin American countries. Accordingly, developments in one country may cause capital and credit markets in other countries to fluctuate and such fluctuations may be significant. Developments or adverse economic conditions in other emerging market countries have at times resulted in significant outflows of funds from, and declines in the amount of foreign currency invested in, Brazil. The Brazilian economy also is affected by international economic and market conditions generally, especially economic and market conditions in the United States. Share prices on the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange, for example, have historically been sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, as well as movements of the major U.S. stocks indexes.\nFollowing the Provid\u00eancia Acquisition, we have minority shareholders, who may interfere with our business plans and adversely affect our business strategy, or our future operating performance, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nFollowing the completion of the Provid\u00eancia Acquisition, we indirectly own approximately 71.25% of the outstanding capital stock of Provid\u00eancia, and other shareholders unrelated to us own approximately the remaining 28.75%. While we filed the Mandatory Tender Offer registration request with the CVM, as required under Brazilian law, completion of the Mandatory Tender offer may be delayed due to the ongoing approval process of the CVM, certain minority shareholders may choose not to participate and/or we may incur additional costs in connection with the acquisition of the minority shareholders\u2019 shares. In the event we own less than 100% of Provid\u00eancia, any such minority shareholders may have interests that are contrary to our business plans with respect to Provid\u00eancia, which may include de-listing of Provid\u00eancia\u2019s common stock. In addition, minority shareholders may seek to assert certain rights that they may purport to have under Brazilian law. If we are not able to implement our business plan with respect to Provid\u00eancia, we may incur additional costs. In addition, it could also adversely affect our business strategy, or our future operating performance, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nWe may not receive dividends from Provid\u00eancia.\nAccording to the bylaws of Provid\u00eancia, the company must pay to its shareholders, including us, at least 25% of its annual net income as dividends, calculated and adjusted pursuant to Brazilian Law No. 6,404 of December 15, 1976, as amended. Provid\u00eancia\u2019s net income may be used to absorb losses or otherwise retained as allowed by Brazilian law, and may not be available to be paid as dividends. In addition, Provid\u00eancia is allowed to suspend the mandatory distribution of dividends in any particular fiscal year if its Board of Directors decides and informs its shareholders that such distribution would negatively impact its financial condition. While we indirectly own approximately 71.25% of the outstanding capital stock of Provid\u00eancia following the completion of the Provid\u00eancia Acquisition, 20% of the Board of Directors will be independent from us, pursuant to applicable Brazilian law.", "PERMNO": 83457, "SIC": 2200, "TIC": "3POLGA"}
