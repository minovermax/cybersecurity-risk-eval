RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which we have made forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that we do not currently consider to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance or financial condition in the future.\nRisks Related to the Chapter 11 Cases\nWe have filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy cases.\nOn the Petition Date, we and certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result, our business and operations are subject to various risks, including but not limited to the following: (i) incurring substantial costs for fees and other expenses associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and the Canadian Proceedings, (ii) the attendant difficulties of operating our business while attempting to reorganize the business in bankruptcy, (iii) potential increased difficulty in retaining and motivating our key executives and employees through the process of reorganization, and potential increased difficulty in attracting new employees, and (iv) the effects of significant time and effort required to be spent by our senior management with respect to the bankruptcy and restructuring activities rather than focusing exclusively on business operations.\nWe may not be able to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities due to the need for Bankruptcy Court approval.\nTransactions by us outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court and with respect to property located in Canada, the Canadian Court, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. We may not be able to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval or such approval may be delayed or conditioned with respect to actions we seek to undertake during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or Canadian Proceedings.\nThere can be no assurance as to our ability to maintain sufficient financing sources to fund our business and meet future obligations during the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThere can be no assurance as to our ability to maintain sufficient financing sources to fund our business and meet future obligations during the Chapter 11 Cases. We intend to finance our operations during our reorganization using funds from operations and from the DIP Facility. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate pursuant to the terms of the DIP Facility, including the financial covenants and restrictions contained therein, or to negotiate and obtain necessary approvals, amendments, waivers, or other types of modifications, and to otherwise fund and execute our business plans throughout the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases and Canadian Proceedings.\nWe May Not Be Able to Consummate our Plan and Emerge from Chapter 11\nAlthough the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan on September 9, 2016, we are obliged to take additional steps to consummate the Plan and emerge from Chapter 11 protection. There can be no guaranty that such steps can be achieved and/or that we will be able to emerge from Chapter 11 within the milestones filed by our DIP Credit Agreement or the Unit Purchase Agreement, respectively.\nTo the extent that the terms or conditions of the DIP Credit Agreement or the Unit Purchase Agreement, respectively, are not satisfied, or events giving rise to the termination of such agreements occur, the Debtors could be unable to emerge from Chapter 11 and/or may be obliged to liquidate.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans. These risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways and may significantly increase the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our corporate or capital structure.\nAdditionally, third parties may seek and obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm the Plan or to convert the cases to Chapter 7 cases.\nWe may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases may adversely affect our business prospects and our ability to operate. The uncertainty regarding the eventual outcome of our restructuring, and the effect of other unknown adverse factors could threaten our existence as a going-concern. Continuing on a going-concern basis of our business is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining Bankruptcy Court approval of the Plan and Canadian Court recognition of the same, maintaining the support of key vendors and customers, and retaining key personnel, along with financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note A to the financial statements, the Company has experienced working capital deficits, losses from continuing operations, and defaults and cross-defaults under various credit agreements and filed for bankruptcy protection on February 2, 2016. Our independent registered public accountants, BDO USA, LLP have included an emphasis of matter paragraph in their auditors\u2019 report which states certain conditions exist which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the foregoing. Our plans in regard to these matters are described in Note A. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. See \u201cReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to our Business\nDeclines in the prices of zinc and nickel have had a significant adverse impact on our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.\nIn 2015, we derived most of our revenue from the sale of zinc and a portion of our revenue from nickel-based products. Changes in the market prices of zinc and nickel impact the selling prices of our products, and therefore our liquidity and profitability are significantly affected by decreased zinc and nickel prices. For example, from May 2015 through December 31, 2015, the price of zinc fell approximately 39%, reaching a six-year low in December 2015. The price of nickel fell approximately 59% from May 2014 to December 2015. Although prices have recently improved, if the prices of zinc and nickel do not return to historical levels and we are unable to restart and improve the production rate and operational capabilities at the Mooresboro facility, our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nMarket prices of zinc and nickel are dependent upon a variety of factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\nthe balance between supply and demand;\n\u2022\navailability and relative pricing of metal substitutes;\n\u2022\nlabor costs;\n\u2022\nimport and export restrictions;\n\u2022\nenergy prices;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in the U.S., China, and elsewhere in the world;\n\u2022\nenvironmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nweather; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of financial commodity speculations.\nDeclines in the price of zinc have had a negative impact on our operations in the past and in the months leading up to the Petition Date, and future declines could have further negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations. Market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for our products, and the price for any one or more of our products may fall below our production costs, requiring us to either incur short-term losses and/or idle or permanently shut down production capacity.\nIf we fail to implement our business plan and financial restructuring strategy, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to achieve our business plan and financial restructuring strategy is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. For example, following restructuring, factors such as increased competition, legal and regulatory developments, general economic conditions or increased operating costs could prevent us from increasing our capacity, implementing further productivity improvements, investing in technology upgrades or continuing to enhance our business and product mix. In addition, the restart and remediation of the issues existing at the Mooresboro facility may take longer and prove to be substantially more expensive than we currently estimate. In such event, we may be unable to restructure our debt or be forced to sell all or parts of our business, develop and implement further restructuring plans, or become subject to further insolvency proceedings.\nAny failure to successfully implement our business plan and financial restructuring strategy, including for any of the above reasons, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may, in addition, decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time.\nImpairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations.\nLong lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment as well as definite life intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, we will incur non-cash impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we assessed the carrying value of the Mooresboro Facilities\u2019 fixed assets, and determined that the future estimated cash flow did not support the carrying amount. Therefore, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charge of $527 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company\u2019s operation were significantly impacted due to the dramatic decline in zinc nickel and other commodity prices, continuing issues that delayed ramp-up of the Mooresboro zinc facility, and lower EAF dust receipts reflecting weaker steel production. If such estimates or their related assumptions change in subsequent periods or if actual cash flows or other market measures are below management\u2019s estimates, the Company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded or additional impairments on assets already recorded.\nWe may be unable to resolve the operational issues with respect to our Mooresboro facility and/we may experience new issues that may cause further delays, each of which would materially harm our profitability, liquidity, financial condition and operations.\nThe Mooresboro facility experienced significant operational difficulties prior to its idling that resulted in low production and several interruptions, and prevented it from achieving its design capacity. Some of the difficulties that we have faced are a bleed treatment system with insufficient capacity, inadequate removal of solids from the leach clarifier overflow, poor current efficiency caused by occasional excursion in electrolyte chemistry, and intermittent equipment reliability issues related to plugging and failure of process lines, pumps and filters.\nAlthough we believe that we can succeed in making the necessary repairs and upgrades to the Mooresboro facility, which will enable us to ultimately operate at or near full capacity, there are significant risks that such efforts will be unsuccessful and that we will continue to suffer a loss of cash flow due to operational issues at the Mooresboro facility. We cannot foresee the severity of known issues, guarantee that our efforts to remediate known issues will be sufficient, or guarantee that we will be able to remediate such issues in a timely or cost-effective manner. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will not encounter additional issues that result in further delays and unexpected costs. In that event, we may be unable to restructure our debt or be forced to sell all or parts of our business, develop and implement further restructuring plans, or become subject to further insolvency proceedings. The Mooresboro facility is in an idle state and currently there is no definitive plan to resume operations in the near future.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to correct operational issues experienced by our Mooresboro facility, such as the remediation of equipment failures and the replacement or design of portions of the facility.\nCorrecting some of the operational issues experienced by our Mooresboro facility requires remediating equipment failures and replacing or redesigning portions of the facility. We may not be able to correct these operational issues, new unforeseen operational issues may appear and the costs of correcting such issues may be greater than expected. We may not have the financial resources necessary, or be able to obtain financing, to address any operational issues at our Mooresboro facility. In that case, our liquidity, financial condition and operations would continue to be materially adversely affected.\nThe projected benefits from the Mooresboro facility may fail to materialize.\nThe Mooresboro facility is in an idle state and currently there is no definitive plan to resume operations in the near future. Even if we are able to restart the Mooresboro facility and resume operations, the benefits that we have projected to receive from the Mooresboro facility are based on numerous assumptions that, if incorrect, could negatively impact such projected benefits. Specifically, the technology used at the Mooresboro facility has only been implemented in a limited number of production environments, and our assumptions with regard to this technology have proved incorrect in certain instances in the past. Some\naspects of this technology have not been tested in exactly the same manner or on a similar scale as compared to the Mooresboro facility. In addition, the equipment in the Mooresboro facility may not be operated in exactly the same manner as in other production environments. We may also not be able to realize the reduced recycling costs or the logistical benefits originally anticipated from the Mooresboro facility operations and may also be unable to penetrate the markets for certain grades of zinc metal that the Mooresboro facility was designed to produce.\nThe metals industry is highly cyclical. Fluctuations in the availability of zinc and nickel and in levels of customer demand have historically been severe, and future changes and/or fluctuations could cause us to experience lower sales volumes, which would negatively impact our profit margins.\nThe metals industry is highly cyclical. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions, levels of industry capacity and availability of usable raw materials. The overall levels of demand for our products containing zinc or nickel reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which depend in large part on general macroeconomic conditions in North America and regional economic conditions in our markets. For example, many of the principal end consumers of zinc metal and zinc-related products operate in industries such as transportation, construction or general manufacturing, which themselves are heavily dependent on general economic conditions, including the availability of affordable energy sources, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and housing demand. These cyclical shifts in our customers\u2019 industries tend to result in significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for our products and services. As a result, in periods of recession or low economic growth, metals companies, including ours, have generally tended to under-perform compared to other industries. We generally have high fixed costs, so changes in industry demand that impact our production volume also can significantly impact our profit margins and our overall financial condition. Economic downturns in the national and international economies and prolonged recessions in our principal industry segments have had a negative impact on our operations and a continuation or further deterioration of current economic conditions could have a negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations.\nSome of our products and services are vulnerable to long-term declines in demand due to competing technologies, materials or imports, which would significantly reduce our sales.\nOur zinc and nickel-based products compete with other materials in many of their applications. For example, PW zinc is used by steel fabricators in the hot dip galvanizing process, in which steel is coated with zinc in order to protect it from corrosion. Steel fabricators can also use paint, which we do not sell, for corrosion protection. Demand for our zinc as a galvanizing material may shift depending on how customers view the respective merits of hot dip galvanizing and paint. In addition, SHG zinc and CGG zinc are used by continuous galvanizers to produce galvanized flat-rolled sheet steel for the automotive market. Some automotive companies have begun to use lighter weight aluminum sheet to meet fuel efficiency standards by reducing vehicle weight, and to meet recycling standards. Any such shifts in industry uses could affect our sales.\nOur nickel-bearing products are used in the stainless steel industry, and demand for our products and services may decline if demand for stainless steel lessens. Nickel-bearing stainless steel faces competition from stainless steels containing a lower level of nickel or no nickel. Domestic production of stainless steel may be negatively impacted by imports.\nIn addition, in periods of high zinc and nickel prices, consumers of these metals may have additional incentives to invest in the development of technologically viable substitutes for zinc and nickel-based products. Similarly, customers may develop ways to manufacture their products by using less zinc and nickel-based material than they do currently. If one or more of our customers successfully identify alternative products that can be substituted for our zinc or nickel-based products, or find ways to reduce their zinc or nickel consumption, our sales to those and other customers would likely decline.\nDemand for our EAF dust or nickel-bearing waste recycling operations may decline to the extent that steel mini-mill producers identify less expensive or more convenient alternatives for the disposal of their EAF dust or nickel-bearing waste or if the EPA were to no longer classify EAF dust as a listed hazardous waste. In the future, we may face increased competition from other EAF dust or nickel-bearing waste recyclers, including new entrants into those recycling markets, or from landfills implementing more effective disposal techniques. Furthermore, our current recycling customers may seek to capitalize on the value of the EAF dust or nickel-bearing waste produced by their operations, or may seek to recycle their material themselves, or reduce the price they pay to us for the material they deliver to us.\nIn our zinc oxide business, we now face competition from new capacity added to the market by U.S. Zinc and by Zinc Oxide LLC, a new zinc oxide manufacturer located in Tennessee, which started production in 2014. This additional capacity in the market may result in downward pressure on prices as these producers attempt to capture new business. Any of these developments would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively against manufacturers of zinc and nickel products in one or more of our markets, which would limit our market share or reduce our sales and our operating profit margins.\nWe face intense competition from regional, national and global companies in each of the markets we serve, and also face the potential for future entrants and competitors. We compete on the basis of product quality, on-time delivery performance and price, with price representing a more important factor for our larger customers and for sales of standard zinc products than for smaller customers and customers to whom we sell value-added zinc-based products. Our competitors include other independent zinc producers as well as metal traders, vertically integrated zinc companies that mine and produce zinc. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources, including financial resources, than we do. Our competitors may also foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, sell products at a lower price than we can and/or adapt more quickly to new technologies or industry and customer requirements. We operate in a global marketplace, and zinc metal imports have historically represented the majority of U.S. zinc metal consumption.\nIn the future, foreign zinc metal producers may develop new ways of packaging and transporting zinc metal that could mitigate the freight cost and other shipping limitations that we believe currently limit their ability to more fully penetrate the U.S. zinc market. If our customers in any of the end-user markets we serve were to shift their production outside the United States and Canada, then those customers would likely source zinc overseas, and, as a result, our net sales and results of operations would be adversely affected. If we cannot compete other than by reducing prices, we may lose market share and suffer reduced profit margins. If our competitors lower their prices, it could inhibit our ability to compete for customers with higher value-added sales and could lead to a reduction in our sales volumes and profit. If our product mix changed as a result of competitive pricing, it could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability.\nIf we were to lose order volumes from any of our major customers, our sales could decline significantly and our cash flows may be reduced.\nIn 2015, our ten largest customers were responsible for 43% of our consolidated sales. In 2015, four of INMETCO\u2019s customers provided 78% of its sales. A loss of order volumes from, or a loss of industry share by, any major customer could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations by lowering sales volumes, increasing costs and lowering profitability. In addition, some of our customers could become involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and could default on their obligations to us. We may be required to record significant additional reserves for accounts receivable from customers which may have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, during the ramp-up of the Mooresboro facility, we only had a limited number of long-term contractual arrangements with our zinc metal customers. Zinc metal customers purchased products and services from us primarily on a spot basis. Customers purchasing such products may choose not to continue to purchase our products and services. The loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchase orders could have a negative impact on our sales volume and business.\nWe depend on our supplier relationships, and adverse changes in these relationships or our ability to enter into new relationships could negatively affect our revenue.\nWe rely significantly on our suppliers. Adverse changes in any of our relationships with suppliers or the inability to enter into new relationships with suppliers could negatively impact our operations and performance. Our current arrangements with suppliers may not remain in effect on current or similar terms and the impact of changes to those arrangements may adversely impact our revenue.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services, and their failure to deliver raw material to us or finished products to our customers could increase our costs and harm our reputation and operating results.\nWe rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture, as well as the delivery of EAF dust to our recycling plants and other raw materials to our production facilities. In particular, a substantial portion of the raw materials we use is transported by railroad, which is highly regulated. If any of our third-party transportation providers were to fail to deliver our products in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell those products at full value or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nEquipment or power failures, delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss at any of our facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales, increase our costs and/or negatively impact our results of operations.\nAn interruption in production or service capabilities at any of our production facilities as a result of equipment or power failure, or other reasons, could limit our ability to deliver products to our customers, which would reduce net sales and net income, increase costs, and potentially damage relationships with customers. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations, damage to our reputation and/or permanent loss of customers. Any such production stoppage or delay could also require us to make unplanned capital expenditures, which together with reduced sales and increased costs, could adversely affect our results or operations.\nFurthermore, because many of our customers are, to varying degrees, dependent on deliveries from our facilities, customers that have to reschedule their own production due to our missed deliveries could pursue financial claims against us. Our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, adverse weather conditions or other refinery incidents. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, periods of reduced production as a result of repairs that are necessary to our operations. If any of these events occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our insurance policies may not cover all of our losses and we could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from, among other things, loss of life, physical damage, business interruptions and product liability.\nFluctuations in the cost or availability of electricity, coke, and/or natural gas would lead to higher manufacturing costs, thereby reducing our profit margins and limiting our cash flows from operations.\nEnergy is one of our most significant costs, comprising approximately $44 million of our production costs during 2015. Our processes rely on electricity, coke and natural gas in order to operate, and our freight operations depend heavily on the availability of diesel fuel. Energy prices, particularly for electricity, natural gas, coke and diesel fuel, have been volatile and have exceeded historical averages in recent years. These fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% increase in electricity, natural gas and coke costs would have reduced our income from operations by approximately $4.4 million for 2015. In addition, at most of our facilities we do not maintain sources of secondary power, and therefore any prolonged interruptions in the supply of energy to our facilities could result in lengthy production shutdowns, increased costs associated with restarting production and waste of production in progress. We have experienced rolling power outages in the past, and any future outages would reduce our production capacity, reducing our net sales and potentially impacting our ability to deliver products to our customers.\nOur operational costs are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in our revenue.\nMany of the expenses associated with owning, repairing, upgrading, and operating the Mooresboro facility and our other operations, such as debt-service payments, property taxes, insurance, and utilities, are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in our revenue. Our expenses are also affected by inflationary increases and certain costs may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. In the event of a significant decrease in demand for zinc and EAF dust processing services, we may be unable to reduce the size of our workforce to decrease wages and benefits or to offset any such increased expenses with higher electricity, or decreases in revenues due to decreased zinc prices. As a result, any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our assets and it is possible that increased operational costs may decrease our net revenues.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental regulation, which may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities that could materially harm our operating results.\nOur activities are subject to complex and stringent environmental, energy and other governmental laws and regulations that have had and will continue to have an impact on our operations and investment decisions and which could adversely affect our operations. These laws include CERCLA, the Superfund Amendment Reauthorization Act, RCRA, the CAA, the CWA, and their state and provincial equivalents, among others. Regulatory compliance for the operation of our facilities can be a costly and time-consuming process. The operation of our facilities requires numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from appropriate federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as compliance with environmental and energy laws and regulations. Although we believe that we have obtained or applied for the requisite approvals and permits for our existing operations and that our business is operated in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we remain subject to certain pending environmental enforcement actions and are subject to a varied and complex body of laws and regulations that both governmental authorities and third parties may seek to enforce in the future. In addition, accidental spills, releases, or other events may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, instances of noncompliance, or other events, including those relating to claims for damage to property, persons, natural resources or the environment.\nIn addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, or new laws and regulations that may be more stringent may become applicable to us and may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Intricate and changing environmental, energy, and other regulatory requirements may necessitate substantial expenditures to attain compliance, including obtaining and maintaining permits. If operations are unable to function as planned due to changing requirements, loss of required permits or regulatory status, or local opposition, it may create expensive delays, extended periods of non-operation, or significant loss of value in such operations.\nPotential federal climate change legislation or greenhouse gas regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our products.\nCongress has, from time to time, considered legislation that would cap and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) for most industrial sectors or impose additional permitting obligations on certain industries, and states have begun taking actions to control or reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the adoption of a climate change action plan, completion of GHG emission inventories or development of regional GHG cap and trade programs. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from certain sources. Some states such as Pennsylvania are now requiring that certain facilities report GHG emissions as part of an annual inventory submittal.\nAny future state laws, federal laws or implemented regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, EPA rules regulating GHG emissions have resulted and will continue to result in electric utilities increasing their rates to pay for compliance measures, and our electric power costs could significantly increase as a result. Further, the potential physical impacts of climate change on the Company\u2019s operations are highly uncertain, and may include changes in rainfall patterns, shortages of water or other natural resources, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and changing temperature levels. These may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.\nWork stoppages and other labor matters could interrupt our production or increase our costs, either of which would negatively impact our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 716 employees, 275, or approximately 38%, of whom were covered by six union contracts. Two of our collective bargaining agreements, covering approximately 69 employees, expire in 2016, one expires in 2017, two expire in 2019 and one expires in 2020. We may be unable to resolve any present or future contract negotiations without work stoppages or significant increases in costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and operating results. We may be unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees and their unions, and we may encounter strikes, further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees, which may interfere with our production or increase our costs, either of which would negatively impact our operating results.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state and provincial statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our employees, and changes in health and safety regulation could result in significant costs, which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our cash flow from operations.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), and comparable state and provincial statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard and the Canadian Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state, provincial and local government authorities and customers. We are also subject to federal, state and provincial laws regarding operational safety. Costs and liabilities related to worker safety may be incurred and any violation of health and safety laws or regulations could impose substantial costs on us. Possible future developments, including stricter safety laws for workers or others, regulations and enforcement policies and claims for personal injury or property damages resulting from our operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities that could impose significant costs on us.\nWe depend on the service of key individuals and specialized and skilled operators, the loss of whom could materially harm our business.\nOur success will depend, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, none of whom are covered by key person insurance policies. These individuals possess sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, financial and administrative skills that are critical to the operation of our business. If we lose or suffer an extended interruption in the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees, or are unable to replace our chief financial officer, who on July 28, 2016 advised us that he will be departing the Company effective August 31, 2016, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, because of the nature of our operations, we require highly specialized and skilled operators. If we are unable to attract and retain these individuals, our business may suffer. The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to succeed members of our management team or other key employees or operators, should the need arise.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property, particularly our proprietary technology related to the recycling of EAF dust and the processing of nickel-bearing materials. Our market share and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe rely upon proprietary know-how and continuing technological and operating innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our competitors could gain knowledge of our know-how or trade secrets, either directly or through one or more of our employees or other third parties. If one or more of our competitors can use or independently develop such know-how or trade secrets, our market share, sales volumes and profit margins could be adversely affected.\nLitigation related to worker safety or employment laws may result in significant liabilities and limit our profitability.\nWe may be involved in claims and litigation filed on behalf of persons alleging injuries suffered predominantly because of occupational exposure to substances at our facilities, or allegations of violations of laws prohibiting discrimination, or harassment or providing other rights relating to the employment relationship. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury or employment law litigation. If these claims and lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, were finally resolved against us, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nCurrent or future credit and financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in several ways.\nFinancial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have experienced disruption, including, among other things, volatility in securities prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. There can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in these markets and confidence in economic conditions. These economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. Tightening credit in financial markets may delay or prevent our customers from securing funding adequate to honor their existing contracts with us or to enter into new contracts to purchase our products and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products. Our customers may also seek to delay deliveries of our products under existing contracts, which may postpone our ability to recognize revenue on contracts in our order backlog.\nOur business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, including the levels of purchasing and investment in general. Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against certain major currencies may adversely affect our financial results or our domestic customers\u2019 ability to export their product. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of disruptions in financial markets and sluggish economic conditions in the United States and other countries, and any resulting effects or changes, including those described above, may have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are not effective. The lack of effective internal controls could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs disclosed in Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures - of this Form 10-K\u201d our management team for financial reporting, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial reporting and accounting officer, conducted an evaluation of the operating effectiveness of our internal controls. Management identified certain material weaknesses, which are described herein. As a result of the material weaknesses, our principal executive officer and principal financial reporting and accounting officer have concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nManagement is in the process of implementing remediation efforts for these material weaknesses, however, until we are able to implement revised internal controls and test the operating effectiveness of such remediated internal controls to ensure the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, any material weaknesses may materially adversely affect our ability to report accurately our financial condition and results of operations in the future in a timely and reliable manner. In addition, although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Any such additional weakness or failure to remediate the existing weakness could materially adversely affect our financial condition or ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and the requirements of the Company\u2019s various financing agreements.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe intend to cancel our common stock upon emergence without any distribution to or recovery for holders thereof.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our existing common stock in our capital structure. As a result, the Plan contemplates the cancellation of our common stock upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases without any distribution or recovery on account of such common stock. In addition, holders of our common stock are not entitled to vote on the Plan. Trading in our securities during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Trading prices for our common stock are very volatile and may bear little or no relationship to the proposals under the Plan. Accordingly, we encourage that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our common stock and any of our other securities. If you acquire shares of our common stock, you may lose all your investment.\nOur common stock was delisted from NASDAQ and will not be listed on any other national securities exchange.\nTrading of our common stock on NASDAQ was suspended on February 11, 2016 and on February 23, 2016, NASDAQ filed a Form 25 with the SEC to remove our common stock from listing on NASDAQ. As a result, our common stock now trades in the OTC market. The trading of our common stock in the OTC market rather than NASDAQ negatively impacted the trading price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. In addition, securities which trade in the OTC market are not eligible for margin loans and make our common stock subject to the provisions of Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the \u201cpenny stock rule.\u201d\nOur common stock is subject to the associated risks of trading in an OTC market.\nSecurities traded in the OTC market generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange, due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all. Because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the market\u2019s perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties with interests in the Chapter 11 Cases.", "PERMNO": 92232, "SIC": 3341, "TIC": "ZINCQ"}
