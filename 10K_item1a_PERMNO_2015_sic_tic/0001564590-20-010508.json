{"cik": "1720116", "company": "Red Violet, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this 2019 Form 10-K, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses which makes our future results uncertain.\nSince inception, we have incurred operating losses. We need to generate greater revenue from the sale of our products and services if we are to achieve and sustain profitability. If we are unable to generate greater revenue, we may not be able to achieve profitability or continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future.\nOur products and services are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected and we may have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services.\nOur products and services are highly technical and complex. Our products and services have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products and services may only be discovered after a product or service has been used by end customers. Any errors or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, or loss of customers, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we could face claims for product liability or breach of personally identifiable information. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial condition could be harmed.\nBecause our networks and information technology systems are critical to our success, if unauthorized persons access our systems or our systems otherwise cease to function properly, our operations could be adversely affected and we could lose revenue or proprietary information, all of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nAs our business is conducted largely online, it is dependent on our networks being accessible and secure. If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our network security controls, the market perception of the effectiveness of our network security could be harmed resulting in loss of current and potential end user customers, data suppliers, or cause us to lose potential value-added resellers. Our business is largely dependent on our customer-facing websites and our websites may be inaccessible because of service interruptions or subject to hacking or computer attacks. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. If an actual or perceived breach were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would not lose revenue or not sustain operating losses as a result.\nWe also rely heavily on large information technology databases and the ability to provide services using that information. A party who is able to breach the security measures on our networks or who otherwise is able to access our system through unauthorized means could misappropriate either our proprietary information or the personal information of consumers that we collect, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions to our operations. Hacking of computer data systems is a growing problem throughout the United States. If we grow and obtain more visibility, we may be more vulnerable to hacking or other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our system. Moreover, the increased use of mobile devices also increases the risk of intentional and unintentional theft or disclosure of data including personal information. We may be unable to anticipate all of these vulnerabilities and implement adequate preventative measures and, in some cases, we may not be able to immediately detect a security incident. Any security incident may also result in a misappropriation of our proprietary information or that of our users, clients, and third-party vendors, which could result in legal and financial liability, as well as harm to our reputation.\nWe may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security. Additionally, any server interruptions, break-downs or system failures, including failures which may be attributable to events within our control, could increase our future operating costs and cause us to lose business. We maintain insurance policies covering losses relating to our network systems or other assets. However, these policies may not cover the entire cost of a claim. Any future disruptions in our information technology systems, whether caused by hacking or otherwise, may have a material adverse effect on our future results.\nPrivacy concerns relating to the collection, use, accuracy, correction and sharing of personal information and any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information, whether through breach of our network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse, or error could harm our reputation, impair our ability to attract website visitors and to attract and retain clients, result in a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services, or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers, and thereby harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we could incur significant costs for which our insurance policies may not adequately cover and cause us to expend significant resources in protecting against security breaches and complying with the multitude of state and federal laws regarding data privacy and data breach notification obligations.\nWe must adequately protect our intellectual property in order to prevent loss of valuable proprietary information.\nWe rely primarily upon a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as other intellectual property laws, and confidentiality procedures and contractual agreements, such as non-disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary technology. However, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products or services is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. If the protection of our intellectual property proves to be inadequate or unenforceable, others may be able to use our proprietary developments without compensation to us, resulting in potential cost advantages to our competitors.\nSome of our systems and technologies are not covered by any copyright, patent or patent application. We cannot guarantee that: (i) our intellectual property rights will provide us with a competitive advantage; (ii) our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes will be effective; (iii) our intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak; (iv) any of the patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or abandoned; (v) competitors will not design around our protected systems and technology; or (vi) that we will not lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against others.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights can be difficult and costly. Litigation, while it may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and could adversely affect our business, even if we are successful on the merits. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties.\nWe depend, in part, on strategic alliances, joint ventures and acquisitions to grow our business. If we are unable to make strategic acquisitions and develop and maintain these strategic alliances and joint ventures, our growth may be adversely affected.\nAn important focus of our business is to identify business partners who can enhance our services, enable us to develop solutions that differentiate us from our competitors, drive users to our websites and monetize our data. We have entered into several alliance agreements or license agreements with respect to certain of our datasets and services and may enter into similar agreements in the future. These arrangements may require us to restrict our use of certain of our technologies or datasets among certain customer industries, restrict content on our websites or grant licenses on terms that ultimately may prove to be unfavorable to us, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Relationships with our alliance agreement partners may include risks due to incomplete information regarding the marketplace and commercial strategies of our partners, and our alliance agreements or other licensing agreements may be the subject of contractual disputes. If we or our alliance agreements\u2019 partners are not successful in maintaining or commercializing the alliance agreements\u2019 services, such commercial failure could adversely affect our business.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, we will be subject to the risks inherent in identifying, acquiring and operating a newly acquired business.\nWe may, in the future, acquire additional businesses, which we believe could complement or expand our current business or offer growth opportunities. We may experience difficulties in identifying potential acquisition candidates that complement our current business at appropriate prices, or at all. We cannot assure you that our acquisition strategy will be successful. We may spend significant management time and resources in analyzing and negotiating acquisitions or investments that are not consummated. Furthermore, the ongoing process of integrating an acquired business is distracting, time consuming, expensive, and requires continuous optimization and allocation of resources. Additionally, if we use stock as consideration, this would dilute our existing shareholders and if we use cash, this would reduce our liquidity and impact our financial flexibility. We may seek debt financing for particular acquisitions, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We face the risks associated with the business acquisition strategy, including:\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our existing businesses, including the diversion of management attention and the redeployment of resources;\n\u2022\nentering new markets or industries in which we have limited prior experience;\n\u2022\nour failure in due diligence to identify key issues specific to the businesses we seek to acquire or the industries or other environments in which they operate, or, failure to protect against contingent liabilities arising from those issues;\n\u2022\nunforeseen, hidden or fraudulent liabilities;\n\u2022\nour difficulties in integrating, aligning and coordinating organizations which will likely be geographically separated and may involve diverse business operations and corporate cultures;\n\u2022\nour difficulties in integrating and retaining key management, sales, research and development, production and other personnel;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers or distribution partners of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nour difficulties in incorporating the acquired business into our organization;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of customers, distributors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nour difficulties in integrating or expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, including the risk that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses may be identified in acquired entities;\n\u2022\nthe potential for future impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets if the acquired business does not perform as expected;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain necessary government approvals for the acquisition, if any; and\n\u2022\nour successfully operating the acquired business.\nIf we cannot overcome these challenges, we may not realize actual benefits from past and future acquisitions, which will impair our overall business results. If we complete an investment or acquisition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the transaction.\nOur business is subject to various governmental regulations, laws and orders, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses or reduce the availability or effectiveness of our solutions, and the failure to comply with which could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities.\nOur business is subject to regulation under the GLBA, the DPPA, the FTC Act, and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, which generally are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have already incurred significant expenses in our attempt to ensure compliance with these laws.\nCurrently, public concern is high with regard to the collection, use, accuracy, correction and sharing of personal information, including Social Security numbers, dates of birth, financial information, department of motor vehicle data and other behavioral data. In addition, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, legislatures and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy and have become increasingly concerned with the collection and use of this type of personal information. As a result, several U.S. states have recently introduced and passed legislation to expand data security breach notification rules and to provide consumers with greater transparency and control over their personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \"CCPA\"), which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to certain businesses that collect personal information from California residents and establishes several consumer rights, including a right to know what personal information is being collected about them and whether and to whom it is sold, a right to access their personal information and have it deleted, a right to opt out of the sale of their personal information, and a right to equal service and price regardless of exercise of these rights. While the CCPA includes specific exemptions for practices and activities regulated by GLBA or DPPA, including certain of our products, it requires, among other things, new disclosures to California consumers and affords consumers new abilities to opt out of certain disclosures of personal information in other portions of our business that are not regulated by GLBA or DPPA. Implementing regulations from the Attorney General that may clarify the CCPA are not due until July 1, 2020 and additional amendments to the CCPA may be signed into law before then. The U.S. Congress may also pass a law to preempt all or part of the CCPA.\nA number of data incidents announced recently by companies in various industries has resulted in significantly increased legislative and regulatory activity at the federal and state levels as lawmakers and regulators continue to propose a wide range of further restrictions on the collection, dissemination or commercial use of personal information, information security standards, and data security incident disclosure standards. This and additional legislative or regulatory efforts in the United States, or action by Executive Order of the President of the United States, could further regulate the collection, use, communication, access, accuracy, obsolescence, sharing, correction and security of this personal information. In addition, any perception that our practices or products are an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, private class actions, reputational harm, or claims by regulators, which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability.\nThese U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, which can be enforced by government entities or, in some cases, private parties, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. Keeping our business in compliance with or bringing our business into compliance with new laws may be costly and may affect our revenue and/or harm our financial results. In addition, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. In addition, new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our clients could affect the activities or strategies of such clients and, therefore, lead to reductions in their level of business with us.\nThe following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations:\n\u2022\namendment, enactment or interpretation of laws and regulations that restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the availability or effectiveness of our solutions or the supply of data available to customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in cultural and consumer attitudes in favor of further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions;\n\u2022\nfailure of data suppliers or customers to comply with laws or regulations, where mutual compliance is required;\n\u2022\nfailure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nfailure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.\nChanges in applicable legislation or regulations that restrict or dictate how we collect, maintain, combine and disseminate information could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the future, we may be subject to significant additional expense to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to investigate, defend or remedy actual or alleged violations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable laws or regulations could also result in significant liability to us, including liability to private plaintiffs as a result of individual or class action litigation, or may result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. Moreover, our compliance with privacy laws and regulations and our reputation depend in part on our customers\u2019 adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with consumer expectations and regulatory requirements. Certain of the laws and regulations governing our business are subject to interpretation by judges, juries and administrative entities, creating substantial uncertainty for our business. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new laws or regulations may have on our business.\nThe outcome of litigation, inquiries, investigations, examinations or other legal proceedings in which we are involved, in which we may become involved, or in which our customers or competitors are involved could subject us to significant monetary damages or restrictions on our ability to do business.\nLegal proceedings arise frequently as part of the normal course of our business. These may include individual consumer cases, class action lawsuits and inquiries, investigations, examinations, regulatory proceedings or other actions brought by federal (e.g., the FTC) or state (e.g., state attorneys general) authorities. The scope and outcome of these proceedings is often difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in lawsuits may seek recovery of large amounts and the cost to defend such litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity and uncertainty associated with investigations, litigation and orders (whether pertaining to us, our customers or our competitors) that could decrease customer acceptance of our services or result in material discovery expenses. In addition, a court-ordered injunction or an administrative cease-and-desist order or settlement may require us to modify our business practices or may prohibit conduct that would otherwise be legal and in which our competitors may engage. Many of the technical and complex statutes to which we are subject, including state and federal financial privacy requirements, may provide for civil and criminal penalties and may permit consumers to maintain individual or class action lawsuits against us and obtain statutorily prescribed damages.\nAdditionally, our customers might face similar proceedings, actions or inquiries which could affect their business and, in turn, our ability to do business with those customers.\nWhile we do not believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened legal proceeding, investigation, examination or supervisory activity will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, such events are inherently uncertain and adverse outcomes could result in significant monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us. Furthermore, we review legal proceedings and claims on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance, including ASC 450, when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. To estimate whether a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated.\nOur relationships with key customers may be materially diminished or terminated.\nWe have established relationships with a number of customers, many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time. Market competition, customer requirements, customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers or acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand these relationships. There is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements, maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers. The loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we lose the services of key personnel, it could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Our future also depends on the continued services of Derek Dubner, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chairman, James Reilly, our President, Daniel MacLachlan, our Chief Financial Officer and other key employees in all areas of our organization, each of whom is important to the management of certain aspects of our business and operations and the development of our strategic direction, and each of whom may be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of these key individuals and the process to replace these individuals would involve significant time and expense and could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nIf we fail to respond to rapid technological changes in the big data and analytics sector, we may lose customers and/or our products and/or services may become obsolete.\nThe big data and analytics sector is characterized by rapidly changing technology, frequent product introductions, and continued evolution of new industry standards. As a result, our success depends upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services that meet changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards. The development of technologically advanced product solutions is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, rapid response and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced products and services successfully in a timely manner. Further, we or our competitors may introduce new products or services or product enhancements that shorten the life cycle of existing products or services or cause existing products or services to become obsolete.\nOur revenue is concentrated in the U.S. market across a broad range of industries. When these industries or the broader financial markets experience a downturn, demand for our services and revenue may be adversely affected.\nOur customers, and therefore our business and revenue, sometimes depend on favorable macroeconomic conditions and are impacted by the availability of credit, the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, employment levels, consumer confidence and housing demand. In addition, a significant amount of our revenue is concentrated among certain industries. Our customer base suffers when financial markets experience volatility, illiquidity and disruption, which has occurred in the past and which could reoccur. Such market developments, and the potential for increased and continuing disruptions going forward, present considerable risks to our business and operations. Changes in the economy have resulted, and may continue to result, in fluctuations in volumes, pricing and operating margins for our services. For example, the banking and financial market downturn that began to affect U.S. businesses in 2008 caused a greater focus on expense reduction by customers of businesses similar to ours. If businesses in these industries experience economic hardship, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate future revenue growth. These types of disruptions could lead to a decline in the volumes of services we provide our customers and could negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.\nWe could lose our access to data sources which could prevent us from providing our services.\nOur products and services depend extensively upon continued access to and receipt of data from external sources, including data received from customers, strategic partners and various government and public record repositories. In some cases, we compete with our data providers. Our data providers could stop providing data, provide untimely data or increase the costs for their data for a variety of reasons, including a perception that our systems are insecure as a result of a data security breach, budgetary constraints, a desire to generate additional revenue or for regulatory or competitive reasons. We could also become subject to increased legislative, regulatory or judicial restrictions or mandates on the collection, disclosure or use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by our providers in a way that allows us to legally use the data. If we were to lose access to this external data or if our access or use were restricted or were to become less economical or desirable, our ability to provide services could be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in maintaining our relationships with these external data source providers or that we will be able to continue to obtain data from them on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable. If we were to lose access to this external data or if our access or use were restricted or were to become less economical or desirable, our ability to provide services could be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe foregoing risks are heightened with respect to our largest data supplier, with whom we have expanded our relationship while securing favorable business terms over the years. If we are unable to maintain our current relationship with our largest data supplier, our ability to provide services could be negatively impacted, as we would need to secure comparable data on similar terms, which would require significant time, expense, and resources, and may in the short-term adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations and, if we are unable to establish a similar relationship with other data suppliers over time, could have a long-term material impact on our business and financial condition.\nData security and integrity are critically important to our business, and breaches of security, unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information, disruption, including distributed denial of service (\u201cDDoS\u201d) attacks or the perception that confidential information is not secure, could result in a material loss of business, substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation.\nWe own and host a large amount of sensitive and confidential consumer information including financial information and personally identifiable information. This data is often accessed through secure transmissions over public and private networks, including the internet. Despite our physical security, implementation of technical controls and contractual precautions to identify, detect and prevent the unauthorized access to and alteration and disclosure of our data, we cannot assure you that systems that access our services and databases will not be compromised or disrupted, whether as a result of criminal conduct, DDoS attacks or other advanced persistent attacks by malicious actors, including hackers, nation states and criminals, breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. We must continually monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Several recent, highly-publicized data incidents and DDoS attacks have heightened consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems. Unauthorized disclosure, loss or corruption of our data or inability of our customers to access our systems could disrupt our operations, subject us to substantial legal liability, result in a material loss of business and significantly harm our reputation.\nAs a nationwide provider of risk and information solutions, we collect, store and transmit files on millions of consumers. These files may contain non-public personal information and other information, and we have implemented technical and physical security policies, procedures and systems we believe are reasonably designed to protect this information from unauthorized access. However, due to the sensitive nature of the information we collect, store and transmit, it is not unusual for efforts to occur (coordinated or otherwise) by unauthorized persons to attempt to obtain access to our systems or data, or to inhibit our ability to deliver products or services to a customer.\nWe may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a cybersecurity incident because a successful breach of our computer systems, software, networks or other technology assets could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe breadth and complexity of our operations and the high volume of transactions that we process;\n\u2022\nthe large number of customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which we do business;\n\u2022\nthe proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.\nThe extent of a particular cybersecurity incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate it may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cybersecurity incident.\nDue to concerns about data security and integrity, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy and security of such data are possible. In the United States, federal and state laws provide for 50 disparate data breach notification regimes, all of which we may be subject to. Complying with such numerous and complex regulations in the event of unauthorized access would be expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability.\nWe face intense competition from both start-up and established companies that may have significant advantages over us and our products.\nThe market for our products and services is intensely competitive. There are numerous companies competing with us in various segments of the big data and analytics sector, and their products and services may have advantages over our products and services in areas such as conformity to existing and emerging industry standards, performance, price, ease of use, scalability, reliability, flexibility, product features and technical support.\nOur principal competitors in the big data and analytics sector include Palantir, RELX Group (LexisNexis), TransUnion, and Thomson Reuters. Current and potential competitors may have one or more of the following significant advantages:\n\u2022\ngreater financial, technical and marketing resources;\n\u2022\nbetter name recognition;\n\u2022\nmore comprehensive solutions;\n\u2022\nbetter or more extensive cooperative relationships; and\n\u2022\nlarger customer base.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors. Some of our competitors may have, in relation to us, one or more of the following: longer operating histories, longer-standing relationships with end-user customers and greater customer service, public relations and other resources. As a result, these competitors may be able to more quickly develop or adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services. Additionally, it is likely that new competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.\nThere may be further consolidation in our end-customer markets, which may adversely affect our revenue.\nThere has been, and we expect there will continue to be, merger, acquisition and consolidation activity in our customer markets. If our customers merge with, or are acquired by, other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, our revenue may be adversely impacted. In addition, industry consolidation could affect the base of recurring transaction-based revenue if consolidated customers combine their operations under one contract, since many of our contracts provide for volume discounts. In addition, our existing customers might leave certain geographic markets, which would no longer require them to purchase certain products from us and, consequently, we would generate less revenue than we currently expect.\nTo the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive consumer and/or business information increases, the demand for some of our services may decrease.\nPublic and commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer and business information have become increasingly available and this trend is expected to continue. Public and commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer and/or business information may reduce demand for our services. To the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public and commercial sources, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf our newer products do not achieve market acceptance, revenue growth may suffer.\nOur products have been in the market place for a limited period of time and may have longer sales cycles than competitive products. Accordingly, we may not achieve the meaningful revenue growth needed to sustain operations. We cannot provide any assurances that sales of our newer products will continue to grow or generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business. If we are unable to recognize revenues due to longer sales cycles or other problems, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have not yet received broad market acceptance for our newer products. We cannot assure you that our present or future products will achieve market acceptance on a sustained basis. In order to achieve market acceptance and achieve future revenue growth, we must introduce complementary products, incorporate new technologies into existing product lines, and design and develop and successfully commercialize higher performance products in a timely manner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to offer new or complementary products that gain market acceptance quickly enough to avoid decreased revenues during current or future product introductions or transitions.\nOur products and services can have long sales and implementation cycles, which may result in substantial expenses before realizing any associated revenue.\nThe sale and implementation of our products and services to large companies and government entities typically involves a lengthy education process and a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources. This process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers\u2019 internal budgeting and other procedures for approving capital expenditures, and testing and accepting new technologies that affect key operations. As a result, sales and implementation cycles for our products and services can be lengthy, and we may expend significant time and resources before we receive any revenues from a customer or potential customer. Our quarterly and annual operating results could be adversely affected if orders forecast for a specific customer and for a particular period are not realized.\nIf we fail to maintain and improve our systems, our technology, and our interfaces with data sources and customers, demand for our services could be adversely affected.\nIn our industry, there are continuous improvements in computer hardware, network operating systems, programming tools, programming languages, operating systems, data matching, data filtering and other database technologies and the use of the internet. These improvements, as well as changes in customer preferences or regulatory requirements, may require changes in the technology used to gather and process our data and deliver our services. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to:\n\u2022\ninternally develop and implement new and competitive technologies;\n\u2022\nuse leading third-party technologies effectively;\n\u2022\nrespond to changing customer needs and regulatory requirements, including being able to bring our new products to the market quickly; and\n\u2022\ntransition customers and data sources successfully to new interfaces or other technologies.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will successfully implement new technologies, cause customers or data suppliers to implement compatible technologies or adapt our technology to evolving customer, regulatory and competitive requirements. If we fail to respond, or fail to cause our customers or data suppliers to respond, to changes in technology, regulatory requirements or customer preferences, the demand for our services, the delivery of our services or our market reputation could be adversely affected. Additionally, our failure to implement important updates could affect our ability to successfully meet the timeline for us to generate cost savings resulting from our investments in improved technology. Failure to achieve any of these objectives would impede our ability to deliver strong financial results.\nIf our outside service providers and key vendors are not able to or do not fulfill their service obligations, our operations could be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed.\nWe depend on a number of service providers and key vendors such as telecommunication companies, software engineers, data processors, and software and hardware vendors, who are critical to our operations. These service providers and vendors are involved with our service offerings, communications and networking equipment, computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance. Although we have implemented service-level agreements and have established monitoring controls, our operations could be disrupted if we do not successfully manage relationships with our service providers, if they do not perform or are unable to perform agreed-upon service levels, or if they are unwilling to make their services available to us at reasonable prices. If our service providers and vendors do not perform their service obligations, it could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation in the big data and analytics sector may limit market acceptance of our products and services.\nSeveral of our competitors have acquired companies with complementary technologies in the past. We expect consolidation in the industries we serve to continue in the future. These acquisitions may permit our competitors to accelerate the development and commercialization of broader product lines and more comprehensive solutions than we currently offer. Acquisitions of vendors or other companies with whom we have a strategic relationship by our competitors may limit our access to commercially significant technologies. Further, business combinations are creating companies with larger market shares, customer bases, sales forces, product offerings and technology and marketing expertise, which may make it more difficult for us to compete.\nWe may incur substantial expenses defending the Company against claims of infringement.\nThere are numerous patents held by many companies relating to the design and manufacture of data and analytics solutions. Third parties may claim that our products and/or services infringe on their intellectual property rights. Any claim, with or without merit, could consume management\u2019s time, result in costly litigation, cause delays in sales or implementation of products or services or require entry into royalty or licensing agreements. In this respect, patent and other intellectual property litigation is becoming increasingly more expensive in terms of legal fees, expert fees and other expenses. Royalty and licensing agreements, if required and available, may be on terms unacceptable to us or detrimental to our business. Moreover, a successful claim of product infringement against us or our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology on commercially reasonable terms could seriously harm our business.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions, including derivative actions, which could limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company and its directors, officers, other employees, or the Company's stockholders and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nUnless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought against or on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, (iv) any action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court located within the State of Delaware). However, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and as such, the exclusive jurisdiction clauses set forth above would not apply to such suits. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act provides for concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and as such, the exclusive jurisdiction clauses set forth above would not apply to such suits.\nAlthough we believe the exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law for the specified types of actions and proceedings, this provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company and its directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nWe could be negatively impacted by the recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19).\nIn light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States, this public health concern, if prolonged, could negatively impact our business. The extent to which the coronavirus (COVID-19) may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors could include:\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board or management;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\u2022\npolitical instability, natural disasters, war and/or events of terrorism.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various commercial and other product development goals or milestones. Also, from time to time, we expect that we will publicly announce the anticipated timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, our stock price may decline.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of publicly traded companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture issuances of shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions or pursuant to our stock incentive plans could have a dilutive effect on your investment.\nSince the Spin-off and through December 31, 2019, we issued an aggregate of 710,299 shares of our common stock in connection with vesting of awards made under the Red Violet, Inc. 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2018 Plan\u201d). Also, as of December 31, 2019, 12,250 shares underlying awards made under the 2018 Plan have vested but have not been delivered, and an additional 2,237,827 shares underlying awards made under the 2018 Plan are scheduled to vest and be delivered through 2022. Pursuant to the 2018 Plan, our board of directors may grant stock options, restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), or other equity awards to our directors and employees. Future acquisitions may involve the issuance of our common stock as payment, in part or in full, for the business or assets acquired. The benefits derived by us from an acquisition might not exceed the dilutive effect of the shares issued as part of the acquisition. Pursuant to the potential plans, our board of directors may grant stock options, RSUs, or other equity awards to our directors and employees. When these awards vest or are exercised, the issuance of shares of common stock underlying these awards will have a dilutive effect on our common stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership may limit individual stockholder ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2019, officers and directors of the Company owned 6% of our common stock (13% on a fully diluted basis). In addition, two other significant stockholders of the Company owned 39% of our common stock (35% on a fully diluted basis). As a result, these stockholders may be in a position to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and determination of significant corporate actions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and these stockholders may act in a manner that advances their interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, and might affect the prevailing market price for our securities.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements available to emerging growth companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock to be less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares of common stock and our share price may be more volatile.\nWe expect that we may need additional capital in the future; however, such capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, when or as we require additional funding. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that may be convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock, our existing stockholders would experience further dilution.\nAlthough we expect that we may need additional capital in the future, we cannot be certain that it will be available to us on acceptable terms when required, or at all. Disruptions in the global equity and credit markets may limit our ability to access capital. Since the Spin-off and through December 31, 2019, we issued an aggregate of 681,000 shares of our common stock in connection with a registered direct offering. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders would experience dilution, which may be significant and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Any debt financing, if available, may restrict our operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue certain operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 17343, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "RDVT"}
