{"cik": "70487", "company": "NATIONAL RESEARCH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe could be negatively impacted by the Coronavirus or \u201cCOVID-19\u201d outbreak or other similar outbreaks.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, and the associated responses, have impacted our business in a variety of ways. Governments have implemented business and travel restrictions and recommended social distancing and other guidelines. Many businesses, including many of our clients, have de-emphasized external business opportunities and restricted in-person meetings while shifting their attention toward addressing COVID-19 planning, business disruptions, higher costs, and revenue shortfalls. Although the impact on our healthcare clients has varied, many of our clients have experienced decreased revenues, contracting margins, and cash losses. Some clients\u2019 cost reducing measures have included and could continue to include reducing or eliminating the services they purchase from us. While these circumstances did not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations in 2020 and 2021, the negative impact could continue to increase.\nWe rely on third-party service providers and business partners, for services or supplies that are critical to providing our clients\u2019 services. These include activities such as internet, cloud data storage, information technology services, and survey related services. These third parties are also subject to risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may interfere with their ability to provide their services in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms or our agreements, which could interfere with our ability to operate our business.\nAt NRC, the vast majority of our associates are working remotely, and to date we have been capable of providing our services without significant disruption. We have made our facilities available for associates to return to work effective July 1, 2021 at their discretion. Historically, we have relied on national travel as part of our sales efforts, but as a result of the pandemic we had placed a temporary hold on all company related travel. We modified our travel policy and limited travel did resume in the third quarter of 2021. To date, we are still capable of providing our services without interruption and without significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting. However, we may need to develop or adapt to new ways of doing business that challenge our leadership, our associate training, our human resources, and our business practices, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so. The short and long-term costs associated with these potential changes are difficult to quantify. For these and other reasons, the outbreak and associated responses could negatively affect our business, and the impact could be material.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nWe depend on contract renewals, including retention of key clients, for a large share of our revenue and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe expect that a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future will continue to be derived from renewable service contracts. Substantially all contracts are renewable annually at the option of our clients, although contracts with clients under unit-based arrangements generally have no minimum purchase commitments. Client contracts are generally cancelable on short notice without penalty, however we are entitled to payment for services through the cancellation date. To the extent that clients fail to renew or defer their renewals, we anticipate our results may be materially adversely affected. We rely on a limited number of key clients for a substantial portion of our revenue. Our ten largest clients collectively accounted for 14%, 14%, and 16% of our total revenue in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our ability to secure renewals depends on, among other things, our ability to gather and analyze performance data in a consistent, high-quality, and timely fashion. In addition, the service needs of our clients are affected by accreditation requirements, enrollment in managed care plans, the level of use of satisfaction measures in healthcare organizations\u2019 overall management and compensation programs, the size of operating budgets, clients\u2019 operating performance, industry and economic conditions, and changes in management or ownership. As these factors are beyond our control, we cannot ensure that we will be able to maintain our renewal rates. Any material decline in renewal rates from existing levels would have an adverse effect on our revenue and a corresponding effect on our operating and net income.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and could experience increased price pressure and expenses as a result.\nThe healthcare information and market research services industry is highly competitive. We have traditionally competed with healthcare organizations\u2019 internal marketing, market research and/or quality improvement departments that create their own performance measurement tools, and with relatively small specialty research firms that provide survey-based healthcare market research and/or performance assessment. Our primary competitors among such specialty firms include Press Ganey, which we believe has significantly higher annual revenue than us, and three or four other firms that we believe have lower annual revenue than us. We also compete with market research firms and technology solutions which provide survey-based, general market research or voice of the customer feedback capabilities and firms that provide services or products that complement healthcare performance assessments, such as healthcare software or information systems. Although only a few of these competitors have offered specific services that compete directly with our services, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, information gathering, and marketing resources than us and could decide to increase their resource commitments to our market. There are relatively few barriers to entry into our market, and we expect increased competition in our market which could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure, increased marketing expenditures, and market share losses, among other factors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.\nBecause our clients are concentrated in the healthcare industry, our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected by changes in regulations, a business downturn or consolidation with respect to the healthcare industry.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from clients in the healthcare industry. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations are influenced by conditions affecting this industry, including changing political, economic, competitive and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operation of healthcare providers and payers. Future legislative changes, including additional provisions to control healthcare costs, improve healthcare quality and expand access to health insurance, could result in lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the environment in which providers and payers operate. In addition, large private purchasers of healthcare services are placing increasing cost pressure on providers. Healthcare providers may react to these cost pressures and other uncertainties by curtailing or deferring purchases, including purchases of our services.\nMoreover, there has been consolidation of companies in the healthcare industry, a trend which we believe will continue to grow. Consolidation in this industry, including the potential acquisition of certain of our clients, could adversely affect aggregate client budgets for our services, could result in clients performing more marketing, market research and/or quality improvement functions internally or could result in the termination of a client\u2019s relationship with us. The impact of these developments on the healthcare industry is difficult to predict and could have an adverse effect on our revenue and a corresponding effect on our operating and net income.\nWe rely on third parties for data collection and other services whose actions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe outsource certain operations and engage third parties to perform work needed to fulfill our client services. For example, we use vendors to perform certain printing, mailing, information transmittal and other services related to our survey operations. If any of these vendors cease to operate or fail to adequately perform the contracted services and alternative resources and processes are not utilized in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected. The loss of any of our key vendors could impair our ability to perform our client services and result in lower revenues and income. It would also be time-consuming and expensive to replace, either directly or through other vendors, the services performed by these vendors, which could adversely impact revenues, expenses and net income. Furthermore, our ability to monitor and direct our vendors\u2019 activities is limited. If their actions and business practices violate policies, regulations or procedures otherwise considered illegal, we could be subject to reputational damage or litigation which would adversely affect our business.\nWe face several risks relating to our ability to collect the data on which our business relies.\nOur ability to provide timely and accurate performance measurement and improvement services to our clients depends on our ability to collect large quantities of high-quality data through surveys and interviews. If our mail survey operations are disrupted and we are unable to mail our surveys in a timely manner, then our revenue and net income could be negatively impacted. If receptivity to our survey and interview methods by respondents declines, or, for some other reason, their willingness to complete and return surveys declines, or if we, for any reason, cannot rely on the integrity of the data we receive, then our revenue could be adversely affected with a corresponding effect on our operating and net income. We also rely on third-party panels of pre-recruited consumer households to produce our Market Insights in a timely manner. If we are not able to continue to use these panels, or the time period in which we use these panels is altered and we cannot find alternative panels on a timely, cost-competitive basis, we could face an increase in our costs or an inability to effectively produce our Market Insights. In either case, our operating and net income could be negatively affected.\nIf intellectual property and other proprietary information technology were copied or independently developed by our competitors, our operating results could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends in part upon our data collection process, research methods, data analysis techniques, and internal systems and procedures that we have developed specifically to serve clients in the healthcare industry. We have no patents for most of our intellectual property. Consequently, we rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret laws and associate nondisclosure agreements to protect our systems, survey instruments and procedures. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such rights, or that third parties will not independently develop functionally equivalent or superior systems or procedures. We believe that our systems and procedures and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot assure you, however, that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future, or that any such claims will not result in protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of such claims, or whether we are ultimately successful in defending against such claims.\nFailures or deficiencies in our information technology platform could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur ability to provide client service is dependent, to a significant extent, upon the technology that we develop internally. Investment in the enhancement of existing and development of new information technology processes is costly and affects our ability to successfully serve our clients. The failure or deficiency of the technology we develop could negatively impact the willingness or ability for our clients to use our services and our ability to perform our services. Our failure to anticipate clients\u2019 expectation and needs, adapt to emerging technological trends, or design efficient and effective information technology platforms, could result in lower utilization, loss of customers, damage to customer relationships, reduced revenue and profits, refunds to customers and damage to our reputation. Although we have procedures to monitor the efficacy of our information technology platforms, the procedures may not prevent failures or deficiencies in the information technology platforms we develop, we may not adapt quickly enough and may incur significant costs and delays that could harm our business. Additional costs could be incurred to further develop and improve our information technology platforms.\nOur business and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience business interruptions or failure of our information technology and communication systems.\nOur ability to provide timely and accurate performance measurement and improvement services to our clients depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology and communication systems, and those of our external service providers. Our systems and those of our external service providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire, natural disasters, energy loss, telecommunication failure, security breach and computer viruses. An operational failure or outage in our information technology and communication systems or those of our external service providers, could result in loss of customers, damage to customer relationships, reduced revenue and profits, refunds of customer charges and damage to our reputation and may result in additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment and recover data loss resulting from the interruption. Although we have taken steps to prevent system failures and have back-up systems and procedures to prevent or reduce disruptions, such steps may not prevent an interruption of services and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all contingencies. Additionally, our insurance may not adequately compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur. Any one of the above situations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nIf we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences.\nIn connection with our client services, we receive, process, store and transmit sensitive business information and, in certain circumstances, personal medical information of our clients\u2019 patients, electronically over the internet. We may become the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access, misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns that could negatively affect our operations. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities.\nWe were the target of an external cyber-attack in February 2020 (the \u201cFebruary incident\u201d) which resulted in a temporary suspension of our services to clients. We will likely continue to be the target of other attempted cyber-attacks and security threats. Such cyber-attacks may subject us to litigation and regulatory risk, civil and criminal penalties, additional costs and diversion of management attention due to investigation, remediation efforts and engagement of third party consultants and legal counsel in connection with such incidents, payment of \u201cransoms\u201d to regain access to our systems and information, loss of clients, damage to client relationships, reduced revenue and profits, refunds of client charges and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. While we have contingency plans and insurance coverage for potential liabilities of this nature, they may not be sufficient to cover all claims and liabilities and in some cases are subject to deductibles and layers of self-insured retention.\nWe cannot ensure that we will be able to identify, prevent or contain the effects of cyber-attacks or other cybersecurity risks that bypass our security measures or disrupt our information technology systems or business. We have security technologies, processes and procedures in place to protect against cybersecurity risks and security breaches. However, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design, manufacturer defects or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. In addition, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them or implement adequate preventative measures.\nIn addition, we use third-party technology, systems and services for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to clients, back-office support, and other functions that in some cases involve processing, storing and transmitting large amounts of data for our business. These third-party providers may also experience security breaches or interruptions to their information technology hardware and software infrastructure and communications systems that could adversely impact us.\nUnder the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, implementing regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or \u201cHHS,\u201d including what are referred to as the \u201cPrivacy Rule\u201d and the \u201cSecurity Rule\u201d (collectively, \u201cHIPAA\u201d), we face potential liability related to the privacy of health information we obtain. We are required through our contracts with our clients and by HIPAA to protect the privacy and security of certain health information and to make certain disclosures to our clients or to the public if this information is unlawfully accessed.\nChanges in privacy and information security laws and standards may require we incur significant expense to ensure compliance due to increased technology investment and operational procedures. Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations, including, without limitation, HIPPA, or any security breach, cyber-attack or cybersecurity breach, and any incident involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of, or access to, sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could require us to expend significant resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures and to remediate any damage. In addition, this could negatively affect our operations, cause system disruptions, damage our reputation, cause client losses and contract breaches, and could also result in regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, litigation or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Even if cyber-attacks or other cybersecurity breaches do not result in noncompliance with privacy or security laws, the perception that such noncompliance may have occurred by our clients or in the news media may have an adverse impact on our stock price and could result in damage to our reputation or loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nReputational harm could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain a good reputation is critical to selling our services. Our reputation could be adversely impacted by any of the following (whether or not valid): the failure to maintain high ethical and social standards; the failure to perform our client services in a timely manner; violations of laws and regulations; failure to adequately preserve information security; and the failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information. Damage to our reputation or loss of our clients\u2019 confidence in our services for any of these, or any other reasons, could adversely impact our business, revenues, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nOur operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.\nDue to the nature of the services we offer, we are subject to significant commercial, trade and privacy regulations. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted, which could have a material and negative impact on our business and our results of operation. For example, recent years have seen an increase in the development or enforcement of legislation related to healthcare reform, privacy, trade compliance and anti-corruption. Additionally, some of the services we provide include information our clients need to fulfill regulatory reporting requirements. If our services result in errors or omissions in our clients\u2019 regulatory reporting, we may be subject to loss of clients, reputational harm or litigation, each potentially adversely impacting our business. Furthermore, although we maintain a variety of internal policies and controls designed to educate, discourage, prevent and detect violations of such laws, we cannot guarantee that such actions will be effective or sufficient or that individual employees will not engage in inappropriate behavior in breach of our policies. Such conduct, or even an allegation of misbehavior, could result in material adverse reputational harm, costly investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or could disrupt our business, and could negatively affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur growth strategy includes future acquisitions and/or investments which involve inherent risk.\nIn order to expand services or technologies to existing clients and increase our client base, we have historically, and may in the future, make strategic business acquisitions and/or investments that we believe complement our business. Acquisitions have inherent risks which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, including, among other things: (1) failure to successfully integrate the purchased operations, technologies, products or services and maintain uniform standard controls, policies and procedures; (2) substantial unanticipated integration costs; (3) loss of key associates including those of the acquired business; (4) diversion of management\u2019s attention from other operations; (5) failure to retain the customers of the acquired business; (6) failure to achieve any projected synergies and performance targets; (7) additional debt and/or assumption of known or unknown liabilities; (8) dilutive issuances of equity securities; and (9) a write-off of goodwill, software development costs, client lists, other intangibles and amortization of expenses. If we fail to successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, we may not achieve projected results and there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur principal shareholders effectively control the Company.\nA majority of our common stock and voting power was historically owned and/or held by Michael D. Hays, our Chief Executive Officer and President. However, over the years Mr. Hays, for estate planning purposes, gifted and/or transferred almost all of his directly owned shares to trusts for the benefit of his family. Currently, the principal holders of shares previously owned by Mr. Hays are the Common Property Trust and the Amandla MK Trust (collectively the \u201cTrusts\u201d).\nAs of February 25, 2022, approximately 42.6% of our outstanding common stock was owned by the Trusts and approximately 52.4% of our outstanding common stock was held by the Trusts and other entities owned or controlled by members of Mr. Hays\u2019 family. As a result, the Trusts and these other entities have the power to indirectly control decisions such as whether to issue additional shares or declare and pay dividends and can control matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate matters such as change of control transactions. The effects of such influence could be to delay or prevent a change of control of the Company unless the terms are approved by the Trusts and these other entities.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and shareholders may be unable to resell shares at or above the price at which the shares were acquired.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock has historically been and may continue to be highly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases that are in response to factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nVariations in our financial performance and that of similar companies;\n\u25cf\nRegulatory and other developments that may impact the demand for our services;\n\u25cf\nReaction to our press releases, public announcements and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission;\n\u25cf\nClient, market and industry perception of our services and performance;\n\u25cf\nActions of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nChanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts who follow our stock;\n\u25cf\nLoss of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nInvestor, management team or large stockholder sales of our stock;\n\u25cf\nChanges in accounting principles; and\n\u25cf\nVariations in general market, economic and political conditions or financial markets.\nAny of these factors, among others, may result in changes in the trading volume and/or market price of our common stock. Following periods of volatility in the market price of securities, shareholders have often filed securities class-action lawsuits. Our involvement in a class-action lawsuit would result in substantial legal fees and divert our senior management\u2019s attention from operating our business, which could harm our business and net income.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur operating results may fluctuate and this may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur overall operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including the size and timing of orders from clients, client demand for our services (which, in turn, is affected by factors such as accreditation requirements, enrollment in managed care plans, operating budgets and clients\u2019 operating performance), the hiring and training of additional staff, expense increases, and industry and general economic conditions. Because a significant portion of our overhead is fixed in the short-term, particularly some costs associated with owning and occupying our building and full-time personnel expenses, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected in any particular period if revenue falls below our expectations. These factors, among others, make it possible that in some future period our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur business and operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain key managers and other personnel.\nOur future performance may depend, to a significant extent, upon the efforts and ability of our key personnel who have expertise in gathering, interpreting and marketing survey-based performance information for healthcare markets. Although client relationships are managed at many levels within our company, the loss of the services of Michael D. Hays, our Chief Executive Officer and President, or one or more of our other senior managers, could have a material adverse effect, at least in the short to medium term, on most significant aspects of our business, including strategic planning, product development, and sales and customer relations. Our success will also depend on our ability to hire, train and retain skilled personnel in all areas of our business. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and many of the companies that compete with us for qualified personnel have substantially greater financial and other resources than us. Furthermore, we expect competition for qualified personnel to become more intense as competition in our industry increases. We cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified personnel to compete successfully.\nLike many other companies, we experienced higher attrition rates in 2021. We may incur higher costs to attract, train and retain these associates. Attrition in our sales and service areas can also impact our ability to retain and attract new business. We may need to develop or adapt to new ways of doing business that challenge our leadership, our associate training, our human resources, and our business practices, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so. The short and long-term costs associated with these potential changes are difficult to quantify.\nFailure to comply with public company regulations could adversely impact our profitability.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of NASDAQ and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Additionally, laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are subject to varying interpretations and continue to develop and change. If we misinterpret or fail to comply with these rules and regulations, our legal and financial compliance costs and net income may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 85482, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "NRC"}
