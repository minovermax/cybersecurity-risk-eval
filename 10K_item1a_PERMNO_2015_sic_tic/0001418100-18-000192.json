{"cik": "1418100", "company": "Avaya Holdings Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-12-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur Operations, Markets and Competition\nIf we do not successfully execute our strategic operating plan, or if our strategic operating plan is flawed, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nEach year, we develop our strategic operating plan that serves as a road map for implementing our business strategy and the basis for the allocation of resources, investment decisions, product life cycles, process improvements and strategic alliances and acquisitions. In developing the strategic plan, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to, those related to the market environment, customer demand, evolving technologies, competition, market consolidation, the global economy and our overall strategic priorities for the upcoming fiscal year. We sell business communications solutions and services in markets where the technology available and the utilized go-to-market models are rapidly changing. Actual economic, market and other conditions may be different from our assumptions and we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic operating plan. If we do not successfully execute our strategic operating plan, or if actual results vary significantly from our assumptions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Potential adverse impacts include, but are not limited to, investments made in research and development that do not develop into commercially successful products, operating inefficiencies, unsuccessful strategic alliances or acquisitions or lower revenues due to our sales focus being misaligned with customer demand or an inability to compete effectively against competitors.\nThe market opportunity for business communications solutions and services may not develop in the ways that we anticipate, and we may not succeed in developing new, innovative solutions and services, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe demand for our solutions and services can change quickly and in ways that we may not anticipate because the market in which we operate is characterized by rapid, and sometimes disruptive, technological developments, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and a limited ability to accurately forecast future customer orders. Our operating results may be adversely affected if the market opportunity for our solutions and services does not develop in the ways that we anticipate or if other technologies become more accepted or standard in our industry or disrupt our technology platforms.\nWe face formidable competition from providers of unified communications and contact center solutions and services, including cloud-based solutions, and this competition may negatively impact our business and limit our growth.\nThe markets for our solutions and services are characterized by rapid changes in customer demands, ongoing technological changes, evolving industry standards, new product introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Both traditional and new competitors are investing heavily in this market and competing for customers. As these markets evolve, we expect competition to intensify and to expand to include companies that do not currently compete against us.\nBecause we offer customizable solutions for contact centers and unified communications which are cloud-based, on-premise or hybrid solutions, we face a wide range of competitors. Some of our competitors include:\n\u2022\nEnterprise UC: Cisco, Microsoft, NEC Corporation, Unify GmbH & Co. Kg, Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise and Huawei.\n\u2022\nMidmarket UC: Mitel and ShoreTel (acquired by Mitel), Cisco, Microsoft, and NEC.\n\u2022\nCloud Products and Services: Cisco, Broadsoft (now a division of Cisco), Fuze, Twilio, Microsoft, 8x8, RingCentral, Mitel and ShoreTel (acquired by Mitel).\n\u2022\nVideo Products and Solutions: Cisco, Polycom (now a division of Plantronics), Huawei, Zoom, ZTE, BlueJeans, and LifeSize (now a division of Logitech International S.A.).\n\u2022\nEnterprise Contact Center Products and Services: Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories (Genesys), Cisco, Huawei, Enghouse Interactive, Mitel and NICE.\n\u2022\nMidmarket Contact Center Products and Services: Amazon, Cisco, Genesys, Five9, NICE and Vonage.\nWe also face competition in certain geographies with companies that have a particular strength and focus in these regions, such as Huawei and ZTE in China, Intelbras in Latin America and Matsushita Electric in Asia.\nSeveral of our existing competitors have, and many of our future competitors may have, greater financial, personnel, technical, R&D and other resources, more well-established brands or reputations and broader customer bases than we do and, as a result, these competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to potential acquisitions and other market opportunities, new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. On the other hand, smaller competitors may be able to respond to technological evolution and changes in customer demand with more speed and agility than we can. In addition,\nsome competitors may have customer bases that are more geographically balanced than ours and, therefore, may be less affected by an economic downturn in a particular region. Other companies may have relationships with channel partners, distributors, resellers, consulting and systems integration firms and/or network service providers which pose a competitive threat to us. Moreover, other competitors may have deeper expertise in a particular stand-alone technology that develops more quickly than we anticipate. Competitors with greater resources also may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or other incentives that we cannot match or do not offer.\nIn addition, because the business communications market continues to evolve and technology continues to develop rapidly, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete against us, but whose current business activities may bring them into competition with us in the future. In particular, this may be the case as business, information technology and communications applications deployed on converged networks become more integrated to support business communications. We may face increased competition from current leaders in IT infrastructure, consumer products, personal and business applications and the software that connects the network infrastructure to those applications. With respect to services, we may also face competition from companies that seek to sell remotely hosted services or software as a service directly to end customers. Competition from these potential market entrants may take many forms, including offering products and applications similar to those we offer. In addition, certain of these technologies continue to move from a proprietary environment to an open standards-based environment.\nWe cannot predict which competitors may enter our markets, what forms such competition may take or whether we will be able to respond effectively to new competitors or to the rapid evolution in technology and product development that has characterized our businesses. In addition, in order to effectively compete with any new market entrant, we may need to make additional investments in our business, use more capital resources than our business currently requires or reduce prices, any of which may materially and adversely affect particular parts of our business, or our business as a whole.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to stronger competition and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in the markets in which we compete. For instance, companies which provide unified communications are purchasing contact center providers, such as Vonage\u2019s agreement to acquire NewVoiceMedia. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their positions in an evolving market and as companies are acquired or sell businesses because they are unable to continue all or a portion of their operations. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. Furthermore, rapid consolidation, particularly in the service provider market, will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on our business.\nWe also believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to continue to expand our cloud-based solutions and services offerings and grow our share of the cloud communications market for such offerings through customer acceptance.\nAn important element of our growth strategy is our ability to significantly increase revenues generated from sales of our cloud-based communications solutions and related services. To increase our revenue, we must continue to expand and develop new cloud-based solutions and services offerings as the market rapidly develops and changes. Our cloud enabled unified communications and contact center solutions and services must offer relevant features and provide high-quality services consistently at competitive prices to attract new customers and migrate existing customers to subscribe to such solutions and services.\nThe cloud communications industry is competitive and rapidly evolving, and we expect competition to increase. The functionality, relevance and customer acceptance of our cloud-based solutions and services will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate these with third-party applications and platforms, including enterprise collaboration, enterprise resource planning, customer relations management, human capital management and other proprietary application suites.\nAs is typical of a new and rapidly evolving industry, the demand for, and market acceptance of, new solutions is uncertain. If we successfully expand and develop our cloud-based solutions and services, our business will remain dependent on customer decisions to migrate their legacy communications infrastructures to cloud solutions based on newer technology. While these investment decisions are often driven by macroeconomic factors, customers may also delay the purchase of newer technology due to a range of other factors, including prioritization of other IT projects, delays or failures to meet customers' certifications requirements and the weighing of the costs and benefits of deploying new infrastructures and devices. In addition, customers\u2019 concerns regarding the architecture, management and integration of such new technology, possible cyber breaches and other security considerations could also negatively affect market acceptance of new solutions. If the market for cloud-based\ncommunications fails to develop, develops more slowly than we anticipate, or develops in a manner different than we expect, or if we are not able to successfully develop and expand our cloud-based solutions and services offerings, our cloud-based solutions and services could fail to achieve market acceptance, which in turn could impact our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur solutions and services may fail to keep pace with rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and customer preferences.\nBoth traditional and new competitors are investing heavily in our markets and competing for customers. As next-generation business communications technology continues to evolve, including, without limitation, cloud-based communications solutions, we must keep pace in order to maintain or expand our market leading position. We are increasingly focused on new, high value software solutions to drive revenue. If we are not able to successfully develop and bring these new solutions to market in a timely manner, achieve market acceptance of our solutions and services or identify new market opportunities for our solutions and services, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, our solutions need to keep pace with new smart devices and the release of new operating systems so that our customers may continue to use and manage our cloud-based solutions on smart devices. The creation, support and maintenance of our mobile applications may require significant resources and requires us to maintain good relations with the application developers and users. If we are unable to support the mobile platforms which our customers use or maintain good working relationships with these developers and users, our growth, business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur strategy depends in part on our reliance on our indirect sales channel.\nAn important element of our go-to-market strategy to expand sales coverage, penetrate new markets and increase market absorption of new solutions is the use of our global network of alliance partners, distributors, dealers, value-added resellers, telecommunications service providers and system integrators, who are collectively referred to as our \"channel partners\". Our financial results could be adversely affected if our relationships with these channel partners were to deteriorate, if our support pricing or other services strategies conflict with those of our channel partners, if any of our competitors were to enter into strategic relationships with or acquire any of our channel partners, if some or all of our channel partners do not become enabled to sell new solutions and services or if the financial condition of some or all of our channel partners were to weaken. In addition, we may expend time, money and other resources on developing and maintaining channel relationships that are ultimately unsuccessful. Furthermore, despite the benefits of a robust indirect channel, our channel partners have direct contact with our customers, which may foster independent relationships between them and may lead to a loss of certain services agreements for us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing relationships with channel partners. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers or market share. Although the terms of individual channel partner agreements may deviate from our standard program terms, our standard program agreements for resellers generally provide for a term of one year with automatic renewals for successive one-year terms and generally may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 30 days' notice. Our standard program agreements for distributors generally may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 90 days' prior written notice. Certain of our contractual agreements with our largest distributors and resellers, however, permit termination of the relationship by either party for convenience upon prior notice of 180 days. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Alliances and Partnerships\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our global channel partner program and the standard terms of our program agreements.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers, component suppliers and partners (some of which are sole source and limited source suppliers) and warehousing and distribution logistics providers. If these relationships are disrupted and we are unable to obtain substitute manufacturers, suppliers or partners, on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to several contract manufacturers. Our contract manufacturers produce the vast majority of our products in facilities located in southern China, with other products manufactured in facilities located in Israel, Mexico, Taiwan, Germany, Ireland and the U.S. All manufacturing of our products is performed in accordance with detailed specifications and product designs furnished or approved by us and is subject to rigorous quality control standards. We periodically review our product manufacturing operations and consider changes we believe may be necessary or appropriate. Although we closely manage the transition process when manufacturing changes are required, we could experience disruption to our operations during any such transition. Any such disruption could negatively affect our reputation and our operating results. We also purchase certain hardware components and license certain software components and resell them separately or as part of our products under the Avaya brand. In some cases, certain components are available only from a single source or from a limited source of suppliers. These sole source and limited source suppliers may stop selling their components at commercially reasonable prices or at all. Interruptions, delays or shortages associated with these components could cause significant disruption to our operations. We may not be able to make scheduled product deliveries to our customers in a timely fashion. We could incur significant costs to redesign our products or to qualify\nalternative suppliers, which would reduce our realized margins. We have also outsourced substantially all of our warehousing and distribution logistics operations to several providers of such services on a global basis, and any delays or material changes in such services could cause significant disruption to our operations.\nIn addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including hosting partners and providers of other cloud-based services. If these third-party providers do not perform as expected, our customers may be adversely affected, resulting in potential liability and negative exposure for us. If it is necessary to migrate these services to other providers due to poor performance, cyber breaches or other security considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it could result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time and expense to us, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government has indicated its intent to adopt a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"). It has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods and has raised the possibility of imposing significant, additional tariff increases or expanding the tariffs to capture other types of goods. In response, certain foreign governments have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the U.S. Changes in U.S. trade policy could result in one or more foreign governments adopting responsive trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for us to do business in or import our products from those countries. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers, which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which the U.S. or other countries will impose quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of our products in the future, nor can we predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete acquisitions and/or strategic alliances, including those needed to increase our share of the cloud communications industry, so that we may accelerate the execution of our growth strategy.\nOur strategic operating plan requires continued investments in acquisitions and strategic alliances with other companies in various areas, including, without limitation, accelerating the development, sales and delivery of our cloud-based solutions and services. Identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives and/or partners may be time consuming and divert the attention and focus of management and other key personnel. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses as part of that process. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including among other things, economic conditions, market consolidation, industry trends and competing bidders. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete any acquisition or strategic alliance even if we expend significant sums in connection with a potential transaction. Without such transactions it may be challenging for us to execute on our strategic operating plan in our desired time frame and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to integrate acquired businesses effectively, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur strategic operating plan requires continued investments in acquisitions, such as our acquisition of Intellisist, Inc. (d/b/a Spoken), a U.S. based private technology company, which provides cloud-based CCaaS solutions and customer experience management and automation applications, in March 2018. We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses and, where desired, their product portfolios into ours, and therefore we may not be able to realize the intended benefits. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions or product portfolios, or if they fail to perform as we anticipate, our existing businesses and our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected. If the due diligence of the operations and customer arrangements of acquired businesses performed by us and by third parties on our behalf is inadequate or flawed, or if we later discover unforeseen financial or business liabilities, acquired businesses and their assets may not perform as expected or we may come to realize that our initial investment was too large or unwarranted. Additionally, acquisitions could result in difficulties integrating acquired operations and, where deemed desirable, transitioning overlapping products into a single product line, thereby resulting in the diversion of capital and the attention of management and other key personnel away from other business issues and opportunities. We may fail to retain employees acquired through acquisitions, which may negatively impact our integration efforts. Consequently, the failure to integrate acquired businesses effectively may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA breach of the security of our information systems, products or services or of the information systems of our third-party providers could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on the security of our information systems and, in certain circumstances, those of our third-party providers, such as channel partners, vendors, consultants and contract manufacturers, to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers. In addition, the growth of bring your own device (\"BYOD\") programs has heightened the need for enhanced security measures. IT security system failures, including a breach of our or our third-party providers\u2019 data security, could disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing, among other things, delays in the fulfillment or cancellation of customer orders, disruptions in the manufacture or shipment of products or delivery of services or an unintentional disclosure of customer, employee or our information. Additionally, despite our security procedures or those of our third-party providers, information systems and our products and services may be vulnerable to threats such as computer hacking, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access, modify or delete our or our customers\u2019 proprietary information.\nWe take cybersecurity seriously and devote significant resources and tools to protect our systems, products and data and to prevent unwanted intrusions. However, these security efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent, detect and adequately address or mitigate such cyber-attacks or security breaches. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a provider of business communications products and services and could cause irreparable damage to us or our systems regardless of whether we or our third-party providers are able to adequately recover critical systems following a systems failure. In addition, regulatory or legislative action related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection worldwide, such as the European GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018, may increase the costs to develop, implement or secure our products and services. We expect cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement. If we violate or fail to comply with such regulatory or legislative requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned and such fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide certain data hosting services to us or to our customers, and interruptions or delays in those services could harm our business.\nOur cloud-based solutions rely on uninterrupted connection to the Internet through data centers and networks. To provide such service for our customers in North America, we utilize data center hosting facilities located in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia and Washington. We also intend to serve other global customers from data center hosting facilities located in India, Japan and Singapore. We do not control the operation of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to service interruptions or damage from floods, earthquakes, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to acts of vandalism or terrorism, sabotage, similar misconduct and/or human error. The occurrence of these or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in the ability to use our solutions efficiently or at all, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nBusiness communications solutions are complex, and design defects, errors, failures or \u201cbugs\u201d may be difficult to detect and correct and could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and cause us to lose customers.\nBusiness communications products are complex, integrating hardware, software and many elements of a customer\u2019s existing network and communications infrastructure. Despite testing conducted prior to the release of solutions to the market and quality assurance programs, hardware may malfunction and software may contain \u201cbugs\u201d that are difficult to detect and fix. Any such issues could interfere with the expected operation of a solution, which might negatively impact customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins.\nDepending upon the size and scope of any such issue, remediation may have a material impact on our business. Our inability to cure an application or product defect, should one occur, could result in the failure of an application or product line, the temporary or permanent withdrawal from an application, product or market, damage to our reputation, an increase in inventory costs, an increase in warranty claims, lawsuits by customers or customers\u2019 or channel partners\u2019 end users, or application or product reengineering expenses. Our insurance may not cover or may be insufficient to cover claims that are successfully asserted against us.\nOur ability to retain and attract key personnel is critical to the success of our business and execution of our growth strategy.\nThe success of our business depends on the skill, experience and dedication of our employee base. If we are unable to retain and recruit sufficiently experienced and capable employees, including those who can help us increase revenues generated from our cloud-based solutions and services, our business and financial results may suffer. Experienced and capable employees in the technology industry remain in high demand, and there is continual competition for their talents. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity and/or errors due to insufficient staffing or managerial oversight. Moreover, turnover of senior management and other key personnel can adversely impact, among other\nthings, our operating results, our customer relationships and lead us to incur significant expenses related to executive transition costs that may impact our operating results. In addition, our ability to adequately staff our R&D efforts in the U.S. may be inhibited by changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of professional and technical talent. While we strive to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and attract the employees that we need to achieve our business objectives.\nBusiness interruptions, whether due to catastrophic disasters or other events, could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations and those of our contract manufacturers and outsourced service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood or other natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, computer systems failure, telecommunications failure, quarantines, national catastrophe, terrorist activities, war and other events beyond our control. For instance, we have operations in the Silicon Valley area of California near known earthquake fault zones, which are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. Our disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to address these interruptions. If any disaster were to occur, our ability and the ability of our contract manufacturers and outsourced service providers to operate could be seriously impaired and we could experience material harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the coverage or limits of our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate for any losses or damages that may occur.\nIntellectual Property and Information Security\nWe are dependent on our intellectual property. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights or if those rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur business is primarily dependent on our technology and our ability to innovate in business communications and, as a result, we are reliant on our intellectual property. We generally protect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other measures to the extent our budget permits. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications that we have filed or that our patents will be sufficient to protect our key technology from misappropriation or falling into the public domain, nor can assurances be made that any of our patents, patent applications, trademarks or our other intellectual property or proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, our business is global and the level of protection of our proprietary technology varies by country and may be particularly uncertain in countries that do not have well developed judicial systems or laws that adequately protect intellectual property rights. Patent litigation and other challenges to our patents and other proprietary rights are costly and unpredictable and may prevent us from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area. Financial considerations also preclude us from seeking patent protection in every country where infringement litigation could arise. Our inability to predict our intellectual property requirements in all geographies and affordability constraints also impact our intellectual property protection investment decisions. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may be at a disadvantage to others who do not incur the substantial time and expense we incur to create our products.\nCertain software we use is from open source code sources, which, under certain circumstances, may lead to unintended consequences and, therefore, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSome of our products contain software from open source code sources. The use of such open source code may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer our products that use open source code to third parties for no cost. We monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend. However, the use of such open source code may ultimately subject some of our products to unintended conditions, which could require us to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts and, therefore, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products or services.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices and claims from third parties asserting that our proprietary or licensed products, systems and software infringe their intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the number of these notices and claims will not increase in the future or that we do not in fact infringe those intellectual property rights. Irrespective of the merits of these claims, any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. These matters may result in any number of outcomes for us, including entering into licensing agreements, redesigning our products to avoid infringement, being enjoined from selling products that are found to infringe, paying damages if products are found to infringe and indemnifying customers from infringement claims as part of our contractual obligations. Royalty or license agreements may be very costly and we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. Such agreements may cause operating margins to decline.\nIn addition, some of our employees previously have been employed at other companies that provide similar products and services. We may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade\nsecrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. These claims and other claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have made and will likely continue to make investments to license and/or acquire the use of third-party intellectual property rights and technology as part of our strategy to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that any costs relating to such activity will not be material. We may also be subject to additional notice, attribution and other compliance requirements to the extent we incorporate open source software into our applications. In addition, third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, that a customer\u2019s use of our products, systems or software infringes the third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to indemnify our customers for some of the costs and damages related to such an infringement claim. Any indemnification requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, any insurance that we have may not be sufficient to cover all amounts related to such indemnification.\nFailure to comply with laws and contractual obligations related to data privacy and protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the data privacy and protection laws and regulations adopted by federal, state and foreign governmental agencies, including GDPR. Data privacy and protection is highly regulated and GDPR imposes new obligations on all companies who conduct activities within an office in the European Union (\"EU\") or offer products or services to EU users, including us, and substantially increases potential liability for all such companies for failure to comply with data protection rules.\nPrivacy laws restrict our storage, use, processing, disclosure, transfer and protection of personal information, including credit card data, provided to us by our customers as well as data we collect from our customers and employees. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. However, if we fail to comply, we may be subject to fines, penalties and lawsuits, and our reputation may suffer. We may also be required to make modifications to our data practices that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe believe that regulation will continue to increase around the world with respect to the solicitation, collection, processing, and/or use of personal, financial, and consumer information. In addition, the interpretation and application of existing consumer and data protection laws and industry standards in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere is often uncertain and in flux. The application of existing laws to cloud-based solutions is particularly uncertain and cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, the impact of which cannot be fully understood at this time. Moreover, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data and privacy practices. Complying with these various laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe are also subject to the privacy and data protection-related obligations in our contracts with our customers, channel partners and other third parties. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with federal, state, or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data or consumer protection, or to comply with our contractual obligations related to privacy, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, contractual parties or others, which could result in significant liability to us as well as harm to our reputation. Additionally, third parties on which we rely enter into contracts to protect and safeguard our customers' data. Should such parties violate these agreements or suffer a security breach, we could be subject to proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, contractual parties or others, which could result in significant liability to us as well as harm to our reputation.\nGlobal Operations and Regulations\nSince we operate internationally, operational, logistical, economic and/or political challenges in a specific country or region could negatively affect our revenue, costs, expenses and financial condition or those of our channel partners and distributors.\nWe do business in approximately 180 countries. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations and significant amounts of our R&D activities in countries outside of the U.S., and we also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers and our channel partners. For fiscal 2018, we derived 47% of our revenue from sales outside of the U.S., with the most significant portions generated from Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. In addition, we intend to continue to grow our business internationally. The vast majority of our contract manufacturing also takes place outside the U.S., primarily in southern China.\nAccordingly, our results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors relating to international business operations, including:\n\u2022\neconomic conditions and geopolitical developments, including trade sanctions, changes to significant trading relationships such as the United Kingdom\u2019s ongoing process of withdrawal from the EU, and the negotiation of\nnew or revised international trade arrangements, including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which would take the place of NAFTA;\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest, or economic instability or corruption, in a specific country or region;\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory constraints, such as international and local laws and regulations related to trade compliance, anti-corruption, information security, data privacy and protection, labor and other requirements;\n\u2022\nprotectionist and local security legislation;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, such as protecting against the counterfeiting of our products;\n\u2022\nrelationships with employees and works councils, as well as difficulties in finding qualified employees, including skilled design and technical employees, as companies expand their operations offshore;\n\u2022\nunfavorable tax and currency regulations;\n\u2022\nmilitary conflict, terrorist activities and health pandemics or similar issues;\n\u2022\nfuture government shutdowns or uncertainties which could affect the portion of our revenues which comes from the U.S. federal government sector;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes or floods, anywhere we and/or our channel partners and distributors have business operations; and\n\u2022\nother matters in any of the countries or regions in which we and our contract manufacturers and business partners currently operate or intend to operate, including in the U.S.\nAny or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, the various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and they may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. Furthermore, our prospective effective tax rate could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof.\nIf we do not comply with certain telecommunications or other rules and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services.\nCertain of our cloud-based communications and collaboration solutions are regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Communications Commission and various state and local agencies, and we are subject to existing or potential regulations relating to privacy, disability access, porting of numbers, Universal Service Fund contributions, emergency access, law enforcement intercept, and other requirements. In addition, government agencies in other countries impose their own regulatory requirements on those solutions. If we do not comply with applicable federal, state, local and foreign rules and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possible restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our solutions or requirements to modify certain solutions. Moreover, changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate now or in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU may adversely impact our operations in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.\nIn June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the EU, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". The political and economic instability created by the Brexit vote has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and the value of the Pound Sterling currency and other currencies, including the Euro. Depending on the terms reached regarding the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU, it is possible that there may be adverse practical and/or operational implications on our business.\nCurrently, the most immediate impact may be to the relevant regulatory regimes under which our United Kingdom subsidiaries operate, including the offering of communications services, as well as data privacy. Since the vote to withdraw from the EU, negotiations and arrangements between the United Kingdom, the EU and other countries outside of the EU have been, and will continue to be, complex and time consuming. The potential withdrawal could adversely impact our United Kingdom subsidiaries and add operational complexities that did not previously exist.\nThe timing of the proposed exit was recently agreed upon and is now scheduled for May 2019, with a transition period running through December 2020. However, the impact on regulatory regimes remains uncertain. At this time, we cannot predict the impact that an actual exit from the EU will have on our business generally and our United Kingdom subsidiaries more specifically, and no assurance can be given that our operating results, financial condition and prospects would not be adversely impacted by the result.\nWe may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, costs and other liabilities.\nWe are subject to a wide range of federal, state, local and international governmental requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators, lose customers and damage our reputation, which could have an adverse effect on our business. The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), and comparable state statutes impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at off-site locations such as landfills. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.\nWe currently own or formerly owned several properties or facilities that for many years were used for industrial activities, including the manufacture of electronics equipment. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state or foreign laws. For example, we are presently involved in remediation efforts at several currently or formerly owned sites related to historical site use which we do not believe will have a material impact on our business or operations, although no assurance can be given that these remediation efforts or remediation efforts we are required to undertake in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business or operations.\nWe are also subject to various local, federal and international laws and regulations regarding the materials content and electrical design of our products that require us to be financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of those products. For example, the EU has adopted the Restriction on Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, with similar laws and regulations being enacted in other regions. Effective in May 2014, the U.S. requires companies to publicly disclose their use of conflict minerals that originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or an adjoining country. Additionally, requirements such as the EU Energy Labelling Directive, impose requirements relating to the energy efficiency of our products. Our failure or the undetected failure of our supply chain to comply with existing or future environmental, health and safety requirements could subject us to liabilities exceeding our reserves or adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nA growing number of climate change regulations and initiatives are either in force or pending at the local, federal and international levels as part of a transition to a lower-carbon economy that is underway globally. Such a transition may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. Depending on the nature, speed and focus of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to our organization. Our operations and supply chain could face increased climate change-related regulations, modifications to transportation to meet lower emission requirements, changes to types of materials used for products and packaging to reduce emissions, increased utility costs to address cleaner energy technologies, increased costs related to severe weather events, and emissions reductions associated with operations, business travel or products. These yet-to-be defined costs and changes to operations could have a financial impact on our business and result in an adverse impact on our operating results or reputation.\nA violation of the FCPA may adversely affect the Company's business and operations.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business. We have adopted stringent procedures to enforce compliance with the FCPA. Nevertheless, we do business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may not be customary and we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though these partners may not be subject to the FCPA. Our personnel and intermediaries, including our local operators and strategic partners, may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which we operate or may operate in the future. As a result, we face the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of our employees or intermediaries, even if such parties are not always subject to our control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other similar laws to which we may be subject. Any allegation or determination that we have violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results, Finances and Capital Structure\nFinancial Performance\nFollowing the Restructuring, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur capital structure was significantly altered by the Restructuring. Under fresh start accounting rules that applied to us beginning on the Emergence Date, our assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit was restated to zero. Accordingly, our financial condition and operating results following the Restructuring are not comparable to the financial condition and operating results reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements. Further, the Restructuring materially changed the amounts and classifications reported in our historical consolidated financial statements. While we do provide in this Form 10-K combined Predecessor and Successor results, it may be difficult to assess our post-Restructuring results as they are not directly comparable to our pre-Restructuring results.\nIn addition to experiencing some seasonal trends, our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and the results of one period may not provide a reliable indicator of our future performance.\nOur quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Fluctuations in our financial results from period to period are caused by many factors, including, but not limited to, the size and timing of new logos, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the mix of products sold by us and general economic conditions.\nIt is also difficult to predict our revenue for a particular quarter, especially in light of the growing demand for IT purchases under a subscription-based operating expense model instead of a capital expense model and the increasing proportion of our revenue coming from software and services. Both of these trends spread the timing of related revenue recognition over a longer period of time. In addition, execution of sales opportunities sometimes traverses from the intended fiscal quarter to the next. Moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period.\nIn addition, we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition. Typically, our second fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.\nShifts in the mix of sizes or types of organizations that purchase our solutions or changes in the components of our solutions purchased by our customers could affect our gross margins and operating results.\nOur gross margins and our operating results can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our solutions, including the sizes and types of organizations that purchase our solutions, the mix of software and hardware they purchase and the level of professional services and support they require. We provide our solutions to a broad range of companies, from small businesses to large multinational enterprises and government organizations. Sales to larger enterprises generally result in greater revenue but may take longer to negotiate and finalize than sales to small businesses. Conversely, sales to small businesses may be faster to execute than sales to larger enterprises, but they may involve greater credit risk and fewer opportunities to sell additional services. Moreover, an important element of our growth strategy is to continue to evolve from a traditional telecommunications hardware company into a software and services company, focused on expanding our cloud- and mobile-enabled contact center, unified communications and innovative next-generation workflow automation solutions. As we increase the proportion of our revenue coming from software solutions as opposed to hardware solutions, we expect to see improvement in our gross margins and operating results. Overall, if the mix of companies that purchase our solutions, or the mix of solution components purchased by our customers, changes unfavorably, our revenues and gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be harmed.\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized or the Company's solutions and devices are sold. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions including the U.S. may be subject to change. The Company\u2019s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or their interpretation, such as interpretations as to the legality of tax advantages granted under the EU state aid rules.\nU.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017 known colloquially as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d among other things, makes significant changes to the rules applicable to the taxation of corporations, such as changing the corporate tax rate to a flat 21% rate, modifying the rules regarding limitations on certain deductions for executive compensation, introducing a capital\ninvestment deduction in certain circumstances, placing certain limitations on the interest deduction, modifying the rules regarding the usability of certain net operating losses, implementing a minimum tax on the \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income\u201d of a \u201cUnited States shareholder\u201d of a \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation,\u201d modifying certain rules applicable to U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations, imposing a deemed repatriation tax on certain earnings and adding certain anti-base erosion rules. It is possible that the application of these new rules may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nCancellation of indebtedness income realized as a result of the Restructuring resulted in material reductions in, or elimination of, tax attributes, the loss of which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s cash flows and financial condition.\nCertain debt obligations of Avaya Inc. and claims against the Company were extinguished in the Restructuring. Absent an exception, a debtor generally recognizes cancellation of debt income, or \u201cCODI,\u201d upon discharge of its outstanding indebtedness for total consideration less than its adjusted issue price. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) generally provides that a debtor in a bankruptcy case may exclude CODI from taxable income but must reduce certain of its tax attributes by the amount of the CODI realized as a result of the consummation of a plan of reorganization. In the context of a consolidated group of corporations, the tax rules provide for a complex ordering mechanism in determining how the tax attributes of one member can be reduced by the CODI of another member. Under the relevant Treasury Regulations, the tax attributes of each member of an affiliated group of corporations that is excluding CODI is first subject to reduction. To the extent the debtor member\u2019s tax basis in stock of a lower-tier member of the affiliated group is reduced, a \u201clook through rule\u201d requires that a corresponding reduction be made to the tax attributes of the lower-tier member. If a debtor member\u2019s excluded CODI exceeds its tax attributes, the excess CODI is applied to reduce certain remaining consolidated tax attributes of the affiliated group. The amount of such CODI realized as a result of the Restructuring was significant and there were material reductions in, or elimination of, certain of the Company\u2019s tax attributes (including net operating losses and credits that were not utilized during the year ended September 30, 2018). In particular, this resulted in a reduction or elimination of our remaining federal net operating losses as of October 1, 2018 that would otherwise have been available to be utilized in the future subject to the limitations pursuant to Section 382 of the Code.\nTax examinations and audits could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such examinations.\nIf the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed were for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are a global company with significant international operations and we transact business in many currencies. As such, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary currency exposures relate to net operating expenses denominated in Euro, Indian Rupee and Mexican Peso. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and the geographic mix of our business changes. In addition, a portion of our borrowings bears interest at prevailing interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin. Therefore, we are subject to risk from changes in interest rates on the variable component of the rate. From time to time we use derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risks associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain intercompany obligations, as well as to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates. The measures we have taken to help mitigate these risks are discussed in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, any attempts to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate and/or interest rate fluctuation risk may be unsuccessful and result in an adverse impact to our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe also continuously monitor economic conditions, including inflation rates, in the various foreign locations in which we operate. As of July 1, 2018, we concluded that Argentina represents a hyperinflationary economy as its projected three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100%. As a result, we changed the local functional currency for our Argentinian operations from the Argentine Peso to the U.S. Dollar effective July 1, 2018 and remeasured the financial statements for those operations to the U.S. Dollar as of July 1, 2018 in accordance with ASC 830 \u201cForeign Currency Matters.\u201d Although the remeasurement on\nJuly 1, 2018 did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses recognized on or after July 1, 2018 will be based on Argentina\u2019s new U.S. dollar functional currency.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. An effective internal control environment is necessary to enable us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important component of our efforts to prevent and detect financial reporting errors and fraud. Beginning with our next annual report, management will be required to provide an annual assessment on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm will also be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our and our auditor\u2019s testing may reveal significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses and render our internal control over financial reporting ineffective, similar to the ones identified in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 referenced in the following risk factor. We have incurred and we expect to continue to incur substantial accounting and auditing expense and expend significant management time in complying with the requirements of Section 404.\nWhile an effective internal control environment is necessary to enable us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important component of our efforts to prevent and detect financial reporting errors and fraud, disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting are generally not capable of preventing or detecting all financial reporting errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, is designed to reduce rather than eliminate the risk of material misstatements in our financial statements. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override and failure in human judgment. A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses:\n\u2022\nwe could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations;\n\u2022\nour reputation may be adversely affected and our business and operating results could be harmed;\n\u2022\nthe market price of our stock could decline; and\n\u2022\nwe could be subject to litigation and/or investigations or sanctions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), the New York Stock Exchange or other regulatory authorities.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we do not adequately remediate these material weaknesses, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or operating results, or comply with the accounting and reporting requirements applicable to public companies, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2018 and the period from December 16, 2017 through September 30, 2018, we identified a number of different control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that are described in detail in Part II, Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlthough we are in the process of carrying out remediation activities, we cannot provide any assurance that the measures we have taken to date, together with any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or to avoid potential future material weaknesses. If the steps we take do not correct the material weaknesses in a timely manner, we will be unable to conclude that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, this could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and could lead to the outcomes described in the preceding risk factor.\nWe have a significant number of foreign subsidiaries with whom we have entered into many related party transactions. Our relationship with these entities could adversely affect us in the event of their bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceeding.\nWe have historically entered into many transactions with our subsidiaries. These transactions include financial guarantees and other credit support arrangements, including letters of comfort pursuant to which we undertake to provide financial support to these entities and adequate resources as required to ensure that they are able to meet certain liabilities and local solvency\nrequirements. We are currently party to many such transactions, and it is likely we will enter into new and similar transactions in the future.\nIn the event that any of these entities become bankrupt or insolvent, there can be no assurance that a court or other foreign tribunal, liquidator, monitor, trustee or similar party would not seek to enforce these intercompany arrangements and guarantees or otherwise seek relief against us and our other subsidiaries. If any of our material foreign subsidiaries (e.g., subsidiaries that hold a significant number of our customer contracts, or that are the parent company of other material subsidiaries) becomes subject to a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar insolvency proceeding, such proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe have no direct operations and derive all of our operating cash flow from our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments or distributions to meet our obligations. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.\nChanges in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could adversely impact our operating results or financial condition.\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and other organizations that develop and interpret accounting principles. New accounting principles arise regularly, implementation of which can have a significant effect on and may increase the volatility of our reported operating results and may even retroactively affect previously reported operating results.\nIn addition, the implementation of new accounting principles may require significant changes to our customer and vendor contracts, business processes, accounting systems, and internal controls over financial reporting. For example, in connection with our adoption, effective as of October 1, 2018, of Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), we will change how and when we recognize certain revenue and costs related to customer contracts, which could materially impact our operating results. Adoption of this standard required changes to our business processes, systems and controls to support the new revenue recognition guidance and we may incur costs as we implement such new processes, systems and controls. If we experience difficulties in implementing new accounting principles, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. See Note 3, \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion.\nWe may not realize the benefits we expect from our cost-reduction initiatives.\nFrom time to time we may initiate cost savings programs designed to streamline operations. As discussed in Part II, Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations,\u201d we have initiated such programs historically, and we will continue to evaluate similar opportunities to the extent the business need arises. These types of cost-reduction activities are complex. Even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we expect, we may not be able to achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetables we anticipate. Any expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and, as a result, our operations and business could be disrupted. Our ability to realize gross margin improvements and other efficiencies expected to result from these initiatives is subject to many risks, including delays in the anticipated timing of activities, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time, unexpected costs associated with operating our business, our success in reinvesting any savings arising from these initiatives, time required to complete planned actions, absence of material issues associated with workforce reductions and avoidance of unexpected disruptions in service. A failure to implement these types of initiatives or realize expected benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition that could be material.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nAt September 30, 2018, the Company had $3,234 million of intangible assets and $2,764 million of goodwill on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The intangible assets are principally composed of technology and patents, customer relationships, and trademarks and trade names. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets with determinable lives, which were $2,897 million at September 30, 2018, are tested for impairment only when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Determining whether an impairment exists can be difficult and requires management to make significant estimates and judgments. Although it was determined that an impairment did not exist as of September 30, 2018, an adverse change in our business or failure to achieve our business objectives and financial projections could result in a significant non-cash asset impairment charge in the future, negatively affecting our consolidated\nresults of operations. See Note 7, \u201cGoodwill,\u201d and Note 8, \u201cIntangible Assets,\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nLevels of returns on pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the amounts to be contributed to fund future pension and post-retirement benefit plan liabilities could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition in future periods.\nWe sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, level of employer contributions, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of our pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets compared to obligations under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, may also be subject to changes in legislation.\nIn addition, our major defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. These assets are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A decline in the market value of the pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets below our projected return rates will increase the funding requirements under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value in the foreseeable future. We are responsible for funding any shortfall of our pension and post-retirement benefit plans\u2019 assets compared to obligations under the pension and post-retirement benefit plans, and a significant increase in our pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks inherent in our defined benefit pension plans in Germany.\nWe operate several defined benefit plans in Germany (collectively, the \u201cGermany Plans\u201d) and as of September 30, 2018, the total projected benefit obligation for the German Plans of $499 million exceeded plan assets of $4 million, resulting in an aggregate pension liability for the German Plans of $495 million. Under the German Plans, which were closed to new members in 2006, retirees generally benefit from the receipt of a perpetual annuity at retirement, based on their years of service and ending salary. Our contributions and benefit payments for the German Plans for the year ended September 30, 2018 are included in Note 15, \"Benefit Obligations,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The total projected benefit obligation is based on actuarial valuations, which themselves are based on assumptions and estimates about the long-term operation of the plans, including mortality rates of members, the performance of financial markets and interest rates. Our funding requirements for future years may increase from current levels depending on the net liability position of these plans. In addition, if the actual experience of the plans differs from our assumptions, the net liability could increase and additional contributions may be required. Changes to pension legislation in Germany may also adversely affect our funding requirements. Increases in the net pension liability or increases in future cash contributions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur degree of leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting obligations on our indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding. As of September 30, 2018, we had $2,903 million of loans outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, $46 million issued and outstanding letters of credit and guarantees under the ABL Credit Agreement, and $350 million of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 15, 2023 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) outstanding (all as defined in Part II, Item 8, Note 11, \"Financing Arrangements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In addition, as of September 30, 2018 we could have borrowed an additional $153 million under our ABL Credit Agreement.\nOur degree of leverage could have consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, research and development and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates under Avaya Inc.\u2019s credit facilities to the extent such facilities have variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust quickly or at all to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nOur ability to continue to fund our obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund our debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our degree of leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although our Term Loan and ABL Credit Agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and any indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the indenture for the Convertible Notes does not restrict us from incurring additional debt. To the extent new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 currently anticipated debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify.\nOur financing agreements contain restrictions that limit, in certain respects, our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur financing agreements contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specific types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt and issue or sell certain preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022\nincur or assume certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsell assets to, or merge or consolidate with, another company.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt instruments.\nThere is no assurance we will be able to repay or refinance all or any portion of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 debt in the future. If we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due, the applicable secured lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and our other ongoing liquidity needs, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Avaya Inc.\u2019s credit facilities restrict the ability of Avaya Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. Accordingly, we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain any proceeds on terms acceptable to us or at all, and any such proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations when due.\nA ratings downgrade or other negative action by a ratings organization could adversely affect our cost of capital.\nCredit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow. The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates have been, and will continue to be, subject to fluctuation. In addition, any adverse developments in our business and operations could lead to a ratings downgrade for Avaya Holdings Corp. and/or Avaya Inc. Any such fluctuation in our credit rating may impact our ability to access debt markets in the future or increase our cost of future debt which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, which in return may\nadversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Convertible Notes\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is currently quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. If the market is not sustained, it may be difficult for shareholders to sell shares of our common stock at a price that is attractive or at all. In addition, an inactive market may impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies by using our shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe price of our common stock and/or Convertible Notes may be volatile and fluctuate substantially.\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the price for our common stock has historically been volatile. The market price of our common stock, as well as our Convertible Notes (as they are convertible into our common stock) may continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to the following factors (in addition to the other risk factors described in this section):\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nvariance in our financial performance from the expectations of equity and/or debt research analysts;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant new services or products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nadditions of or changes to key employees;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u2022\ntrading volumes of our common stock and/or Convertible Notes;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our equity securities and/or future issuances of indebtedness;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimation of the future sizes and growth rates of our markets;\n\u2022\nlegislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions;\n\u2022\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity by third parties, including by the counterparties to the note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes; and\n\u2022\ndilution that may occur upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes or the exercise of the warrants we issued in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have at times been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. These market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and/or Convertible Notes irrespective of our operating performance.\nIf securities or industry analysts discontinue publishing research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on operating results, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and/or the market for our common stock.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of our Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common\nstock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a convertible note hedge (\"Bond Hedge\") transaction with each of Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse Capital LLC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the \u201cCall Spread Counterparties\u201d). The Bond Hedge transactions reduced the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. We also entered into a warrant (\"Call Spread Warrant\") transaction with each of the Call Spread Counterparties. The Call Spread Warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the Call Spread Warrants.\nEach of the Call Spread Counterparties (or an affiliate) may modify its initial hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and is likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect the ability to convert the Convertible Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that holders of the Convertible Notes will receive upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.\nSignificant exercises of equity awards or warrants or conversion of convertible debt could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had 110,218,653 shares of common stock issued and 110,012,790 shares of common stock outstanding; however, the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include 4,360,529 shares and 18,255,526 shares that may be issued upon the exercise of equity awards and warrants, respectively, or 16,132,847 shares issuable upon the conversion of our Convertible Notes. In addition, we have the ability to issue an additional 2,639,418 equity awards tied to our common stock under our currently authorized equity incentive plans. The exercise of equity awards and warrants and the conversion of convertible debt instruments could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, will reduce the percentage of common stock held by the Company\u2019s current stockholders and may cause its current stockholders to suffer significant dilution, which may adversely affect the market.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover, which could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of the Convertible Notes.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. Our governing documents include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to create and issue, without stockholder approval, up to 55,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, which could be used to dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\ngrant the board of directors the exclusive right to fill a vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy is due to an increase in the number of directors or death, resignation or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill such vacancies on the board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire stockholders to follow certain advance notice procedures to bring a proposal before an annual meeting, including proposing nominees for election as directors, which may discourage a potential acquirer from soliciting proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own director or slate of directors.\nThese provisions could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of our Convertible Notes. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in the name of the Company, actions against our directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware.", "PERMNO": 17234, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "AVYA"}
