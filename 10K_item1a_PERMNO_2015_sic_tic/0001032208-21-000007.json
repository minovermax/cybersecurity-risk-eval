RISK FACTORS\nWhen evaluating our company and its subsidiaries and any investment in our or their securities, you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report and in the other documents we file with the SEC, including in documents we file subsequent to this report. These risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. We may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks occurs, our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected, and the trading prices of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could substantially decline. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information concerning our company set forth in or attached as an exhibit to this report, including, among other things, the information set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements and in \u201cPart II - Item 7. MD&A.\u201d\nRisks Related to Sempra Energy\nOperational and Structural Risks\nSempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and entities that are accounted for as equity method investments, such as Oncor Holdings and Cameron LNG JV.\nWe are a holding company and substantially all our assets are owned by our subsidiaries or entities we do not control, which include equity method investments such as Oncor Holdings and Cameron LNG JV. Our ability to pay dividends and to meet our debt and other obligations largely depends on cash flows from our subsidiaries and equity method investments. Cash flows from our subsidiaries and equity method investments depend on their ability to successfully execute their business strategies and generate cash flows in excess of their own expenditures, common and preferred dividends (if any), and debt and other obligations. In addition, the entities accounted for as equity method investments, which we do not control, and our subsidiaries are all separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us and could be precluded from paying any such dividends or making any such loans or distributions under certain circumstances, including, among other things, as a result of legislation, regulation, court order or contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress. The inability to access capital from our subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.\nSempra Energy\u2019s rights to the assets of its subsidiaries and equity method investments are structurally subordinated to the claims of that entity\u2019s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, to the extent Sempra Energy is a creditor of any such entity, its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that entity and any indebtedness of the entity senior to that held by Sempra Energy.\nSempra Energy has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control.\nWe have and make investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control, which include Sempra Energy\u2019s direct or indirect interest in Oncor, Cameron LNG JV and RBS Sempra Commodities; SDG&E\u2019s interest in SONGS; and IEnova\u2019s indirect interest in the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan natural gas marine pipeline in Mexico, among others. In some cases, we engage in other arrangements with or for these entities that could expose us to risks in addition to our investment. For example, Sempra Energy has provided guarantees in support of financing agreements related to Cameron LNG JV, Sempra Energy is subject to certain indemnities with respect to RBS Sempra Commodities, and Sempra Mexico has provided loans to JVs in which it has investments. We discuss the guarantees in Note 6, indemnities in Note 16, and affiliate loans in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWhere we share control with other equity owners, any disagreements among the owners of these businesses with respect to material issues, including strategy, financial, operational or transactional matters, could have a material adverse effect on the ability of that business to move forward with key initiatives or projects or take other actions, and could also negatively affect the long-term relationships among the business owners and the ability of the entity to function efficiently and effectively. Any such circumstance could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, result of operations and/or prospects.\nWith respect to ventures and other businesses over which we do not exercise control, we could be responsible for significant liabilities or losses related to these businesses, such as our investment in RBS Sempra Commodities where we recorded $100 million in equity losses representing our estimated obligations to settle outstanding tax matters and related legal costs, and where we could be subject to further losses upon final resolution of these matters. In addition to other risks inherent in these businesses, if their management were to fail to perform adequately, the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses, business decisions were made with which we do not agree or other factors were to result in liabilities or losses at these entities, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss our investments further in Notes 5, 6 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders.\nActivist shareholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. In taking these steps, activist shareholders could seek to acquire significant amounts of our capital stock, which could threaten our ability to use some or all our NOL carryforwards if any such attempt were to result in our corporation undergoing an \u201cownership change\u201d under applicable tax rules. Responding to activist shareholders would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses (in\nthe case of a proxy contest) and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy.\nAny perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest or increased ownership or other interest in our company from activist shareholders could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability, which could be exploited by our competitors and/or other activist shareholders, result in the loss of business opportunities, and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and/or prospects. Further, any such actions could cause significant fluctuations in the trading prices of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that may not reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nFinancial and Capital Stock-Related Risks\nAny impairment of our assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nWe could experience a reduction in the fair value of our assets, including our long-lived assets, intangible assets or goodwill, upon the occurrence of many of the risks discussed in these risk factors. Any such reduction in the fair value of our assets could result in an impairment loss that could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which such charge is recorded. We discuss our impairment testing of long-lived assets and goodwill and the factors considered in such testing in \u201cPart II - Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe economic interest, voting rights and market value of our outstanding common and preferred stock may be adversely affected by any additional equity securities we may issue and, with respect to our common stock, by our outstanding preferred stock.\nAt February 25, 2021, we have 6,650,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding, 5,750,000 of which constitute our series B preferred stock and are scheduled to convert into shares of our common stock on July 15, 2021, and the remaining 900,000 of which constitute our series C preferred stock and are not convertible. We also issued 13,781,025 shares of our common stock on January 15, 2021 upon the mandatory conversion of our former series A preferred stock in accordance with the terms of those securities. We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional shares of common or preferred stock, which, together with the conversion of the series B preferred stock into our common stock, may materially dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our outstanding common and preferred stock and materially adversely affect the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nDividend requirements associated with our preferred stock subject us to certain risks.\nAny future cash dividends we pay on our series B preferred stock and series C preferred stock will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, capital requirements and results of operations, the ability of our subsidiaries and equity method investees to distribute cash to us, and other factors that our board of directors may consider relevant. Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on our preferred stock when due would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our preferred stock, our common stock and our debt securities and would prohibit us, under the terms of our preferred stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of our common stock (subject to limited exceptions) until such time as we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock.\nThe terms of the series B preferred stock and series C preferred stock generally provide that if dividends on any shares of the preferred stock have not been declared and paid or have been declared but not paid for six or more quarterly dividend periods for the series B preferred stock and three or more semi-annual dividend periods for the series C preferred stock, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of the preferred stock, voting together as a single class, will be entitled to elect a total of two additional members to our board of directors, subject to certain terms and limitations.\nRisks Related to All Sempra Energy Businesses\nOperational Risks\nOur businesses face risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is materially impacting communities, supply chains and markets around the world. The U.S. economy is experiencing a significant slowdown and claims for unemployment have substantially increased. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our results of operations. However, we are conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and virtualization or cancellation of certain business activities, among other modifications. If these or other similar measures were to increase or continue for an extended period, we could experience employee absenteeism, decreased efficiency and productivity by our workforce and other similar impacts that could jeopardize our ability to sustain operations and satisfy compliance requirements and could result in higher operating costs. We also have observed other companies, including our current and prospective counterparties, customers and partners, as well as many governments, including our regulators and other governing bodies that affect our businesses, taking precautionary, preemptive and responsive actions to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they may take further actions that alter their normal operations. These actions by third parties could materially impact our operations, results, liquidity and ability to pursue capital projects and strategic initiatives. For example, the CPUC has required that all energy companies under its jurisdiction take action to implement several emergency customer protection measures to support California customers. The measures currently apply to all residential and small business customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and include suspending service disconnections due to nonpayment, waiving late payment fees, and offering flexible payment plans to customers experiencing difficulty paying their electric or gas bills. These actions have resulted in a reduction in payments received from our customers and an increase in uncollectible accounts, which could become material, and any inability or delay in recovering all or a substantial portion of these costs could have a material adverse effect on the cash flows, financial condition and results of operations for Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas. As an additional example, we reached a final investment decision with respect to ECA LNG Phase 1 in November 2020, the timing of which was delayed in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. If this or other projects under development are further delayed due to continuing or worsening conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or other related factors, the performance and prospects of our LNG export business could be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas are not currently constrained in their ability to borrow money at reasonable rates, these circumstances could change if the COVID-19 pandemic worsens or continues for an extended period and adversely affects conditions in the capital markets, which could have a material negative effect on our liquidity, results of operations, strategic initiatives and prospects. The COVID-19 pandemic could result in an increased slowdown of certain of our capital spending if conditions deteriorate or fail to improve in the near term, which could have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy\u2019s, SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 results of operations and prospects.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. However, we cannot at this time predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will further impact our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSevere weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics, accidents, equipment failures, explosions or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nLike other capital intensive businesses, our facilities and infrastructure may be damaged by severe weather conditions and natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, other storms, tsunamis, heat waves, rising sea levels, floods, mudslides, drought, solar events and electromagnetic events; pandemics; accidents; equipment failures; explosions; or acts of terrorism, vandalism, war or criminality. Because we are in the business of using, storing, transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials, as well as radioactive materials, and operating highly energized equipment, the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure, as well as the risks to the surrounding communities for which we could be held responsible, are substantially greater than the risks such incidents may pose to a typical business. The facilities and infrastructure that we own or in which we have interests that may be subject to such incidents include, among others:\n\u25aanatural gas, propane and ethane pipelines, storage and compressor facilities\n\u25aaelectric transmission, distribution and battery storage equipment\n\u25aapower generation plants, including renewable energy and natural gas-fired generation\n\u25aamarine and inland ethane and liquid fuels, LNG and LPG facilities, terminals and storage\n\u25aanuclear power facilities and nuclear fuel and nuclear waste storage facilities (through SDG&E\u2019s minority interest in SONGS, which is currently being decommissioned)\nSuch incidents could result in severe business disruptions; prolonged power outages; property damage, injuries or loss of life for which our businesses could be liable; significant decreases in revenues and earnings; and/or other significant additional costs to us, including as a result of higher maintenance costs or restoration expenses, amounts to compensate third parties, and regulatory\nfines, penalties and disallowances. For our regulated utilities, these liabilities or increased costs may not be recoverable in rates. Such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide natural gas and electricity to our customers. Moreover, weather-related incidents have become more prevalent, unpredictable and severe as a result of climate change or other factors, and we are currently in the midst of a severe global pandemic, any of which could have a greater impact on our businesses than is currently anticipated and, for our regulated utilities, rates may not be adequately or timely adjusted to reflect any such increased impact. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nDepending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires; natural gas, natural gas odorant, propane or ethane leaks; releases of other GHG emissions; radioactive releases; explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties; or personal injuries, health impacts or fatalities, or could present a nuisance to impacted communities. Any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us. In some cases, we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault, such as in cases in which the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies. We discuss how the application of this doctrine in California imposes strict liability on an electric utility whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire (meaning the utility may be found liable regardless of fault) below under \u201cRisks Related to the California Utilities - Operational Risks.\u201d Insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become prohibitively expensive, may be disputed by the insurers, or may become unavailable for certain of these risks or at sufficient levels, and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to the existence of limitations, exclusions, high deductibles, failure to comply with procedural requirements, and other factors, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects, as well as the trading prices of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nThe operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.\nSeveral of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. Our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a company-by-company basis. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIn addition to general information risks and cyber risks that all large corporations face (e.g. malware, general cyber- or phishing-attacks by outsiders, malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information), we face evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer and employee information, smart grid infrastructure, and natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage and other information, and our operations rely on complex, interconnected networks of generation, transmission, distribution, storage, control, and communication technologies and systems. Existing business technologies and the deployment of new business technologies represent a large-scale opportunity for attacks on or other failures to protect our information systems and confidential information, as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and our natural gas infrastructure. In particular, various private and public entities have noted that cyber- and other attacks targeting utility systems and other energy infrastructures are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. Additionally, the California Utilities are increasingly required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer energy usage and personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California\u2019s electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice, increasing the risks of inadvertent disclosure or other unauthorized access of sensitive information. Further, the virtualization of many business activities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increases cyber risk, and there generally has been an associated increase in targeted cyber-attacks. Moreover, all of our businesses operating in California are subject to enhanced state privacy laws that have recently taken effect, which require companies that collect information on California residents to, among other things, make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provide a new cause of action for breaches of certain highly sensitive categories of personal information resulting from a failure to reasonably secure them, and other states in which we do business could adopt similar laws in the future.\nAddressing cyber risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across Sempra Energy\u2019s businesses, including investing in risk management and information security measures for the protection of our systems and information. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing system protection measures are significant, and they could materially increase to address increasingly intense, complex and sophisticated cyber risks. Despite our efforts, our businesses are not fully insulated from cyber-attacks or system disruptions. In addition, we often rely on third-party vendors to deploy new business\ntechnologies and maintain, modify and update our systems, including systems that manage sensitive information, and these third parties could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures with respect to these systems. Any attack on our information systems, the integrity of the energy grid, our pipelines and distribution and storage infrastructure or one of our facilities, or unauthorized access, damage or improper disclosure of confidential customer or employee information or other sensitive data, could result in energy delivery service failures, financial and reputational loss, violations of privacy laws, fines or penalties, customer dissatisfaction and litigation, any of which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects. Although Sempra Energy currently maintains cyber liability insurance, this insurance is limited in scope and subject to exceptions, conditions and coverage limitations and may not cover any or even a substantial portion of the costs associated with the consequences of any compromise of our information systems or confidential information, and there is no guarantee that the insurance we currently maintain will continue to be available at rates that we believe are commercially reasonable.\nFurther, as seen with recent cyber-attacks around the world, the goal of a cyber-attack may be primarily to inflict large-scale harm on a company and the places where it operates. Any such cyber-attack could cause widespread destruction of or disruption to our operating, financial and administrative systems that could materially adversely affect our business operations and the integrity of the power grid, our pipelines and distribution and storage infrastructure or one of our related facilities, negatively impact our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements or comply with ongoing disclosure obligations or other regulatory requirements, and/or release confidential information about our company and our customers, employees and other constituents, any of which could lead to sanctions or negatively affect the general perception of our business in the financial markets and which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nFinancial Risks\nThe substantial debt service obligations of Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects, and with respect to Sempra Energy, could require additional equity securities issuances.\nThe substantial debt service obligations of Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects by, among other things:\n\u25aamaking it more difficult and costly for each of these companies to service, pay or refinance its debts as they become due, particularly during adverse economic or industry conditions\n\u25aalimiting flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or react to changes in each of our businesses and the industry sectors in which they operate\n\u25aarequiring a substantial portion of available cash to be used for debt service payments, including interest and potential redemptions, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, acquisitions, dividend payments and other general corporate purposes\n\u25aacausing lenders to require additional materially adverse terms, conditions or covenants in the debt instruments for new debt, which might include restrictions on uses of proceeds or other assets or limitations on the ability to incur additional debt, create liens, pay dividends, redeem or repurchase stock, make investments or receive distributions from subsidiaries or equity method investments\nSempra Energy is committed to maintaining or improving its current credit ratings. To maintain these credit ratings, we may reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness with the proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock. Additional equity issuances may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of existing holders of Sempra Energy\u2019s common and preferred stock. There is no assurance that, should we elect to do so, we would be able to issue additional shares of Sempra Energy\u2019s common or preferred stock with terms that we consider acceptable or at all or reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness to a level that allows us to maintain our investment grade credit ratings, which may have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe availability and cost of debt or equity financing could be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, as well as other factors, and any such negative effects could materially adversely affect us.\nOur businesses are capital intensive and we rely on long-term debt to fund a significant portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a significant portion of day-to-day business operations. Sempra Energy may also seek to raise capital by issuing additional equity.\nLimitations on the availability of credit, increases in interest rates or credit spreads or other negative effects on the terms of any debt or equity financing we may pursue could materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects, as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments. In difficult market environments, we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support new or ongoing business activities. This could cause us to reduce non-safety related capital expenditures and could increase our cost of servicing debt, both of which could significantly reduce our short-term and long-term profitability.\nOther factors can affect the availability and cost of capital for our businesses in addition to the terms of debt and equity financing, including, among others:\n\u25aaadverse changes to economic and financial market conditions and laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or do business\n\u25aathe overall health of the energy industry\n\u25aavolatility in natural gas or electricity prices\n\u25aafor Sempra Energy and SDG&E, risks related to California wildfires and any failure by the State of California to adequately address the financial and operational wildfire-related risks facing California electric IOUs\n\u25aathe deterioration of or uncertainty in the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in California\n\u25aacredit ratings downgrades\nWe are subject to additional risks due to uncertainty relating to the calculation of LIBOR and its scheduled discontinuance.\nCertain of our financial and commercial agreements, including variable rate indebtedness and credit facilities, as well as interest rate derivatives, incorporate LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing certain rates. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom, which regulates LIBOR, has emphasized the need for market participants to transition away from LIBOR. ICE Benchmark Administration, LIBOR\u2019s administrator, with the support of the FCA, has indicated it will cease publication of certain key U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors in mid-2023 for existing loans. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve has issued a statement advising banks to stop making new LIBOR-based issuances by the end of 2021. These could cause LIBOR to perform differently than it has performed historically pending any discontinuance or modification and after any modification. The adoption of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which has been identified as the replacement benchmark rate for LIBOR, may result in interest payments that are higher than expected or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such indebtedness if the applicable LIBOR rate was available in its current form. Changes to or the discontinuance of LIBOR, any further uncertainty regarding the implementation of such changes or discontinuance, and uncertainties regarding the performance and characteristics of alternative benchmark rates, could have a material adverse effect on our existing and future variable rate indebtedness and/or borrowings, our existing and future interest rate hedges and the cost of doing business under our commercial agreements that incorporate LIBOR, and could require us to seek to amend the terms of the relevant indebtedness or agreements, which may be on terms materially worse than existing terms. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.\nCertain credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place those ratings on negative outlook.\nCredit rating agencies routinely evaluate Sempra Energy and the California Utilities, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including the increased risk of wildfires in California; perceived supportiveness of the regulatory environment affecting utility operations, including delays and difficulties in obtaining recovery, or the denial of recovery, for wildfire-related or other costs; the deterioration of, or uncertainty in, the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in California; ability to generate cash flows; level of indebtedness; overall financial strength, including credit metrics; specific transactions or events, such as share repurchases; diversification beyond the regulated utility business (in the case of Sempra Energy); and the status of certain capital projects, as well as other factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry generally. Downgrades and factors causing downgrades of one or both of the California Utilities can have a material impact on Sempra Energy\u2019s credit ratings. Downgrades, as well as the factors causing such downgrades, of Sempra Energy\u2019s credit ratings can also have a material impact on the credit ratings of the California Utilities.\nWhile the current Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch (collectively, the Rating Agencies) issuer credit ratings for Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas are investment grade, some of these ratings have experienced downgrades or have been moved to negative outlook in 2020 and there is no assurance that these credit ratings will not be further downgraded. In that regard, S&P has Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas on negative outlook, and these negative outlooks could result in downgrades, or other negative credit\nrating actions could occur, at any time. We discuss these credit ratings further in \u201cPart II - Item 7. MD&A - Capital Resources and Liquidity.\u201d\nFor Sempra Energy, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among other things, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\u25aaSempra Energy\u2019s failure to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\u25aainvesting disproportionally in unregulated or uncontracted business and the impact on business mix and financial credit metrics over time\n\u25aacatastrophic wildfires caused by SDG&E, or catastrophic wildfires caused by any California electric IOUs that participate in the Wildfire Fund, which could exhaust the fund considerably earlier than expected\n\u25aaa ratings downgrade at SDG&E and/or SoCalGas\n\u25aacontinuing to acquire shares under a share repurchase program\nFor SDG&E, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among other things, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\u25aaSDG&E\u2019s failure to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\u25aathe CPUC does not effectively implement the more supportive prudency standard for determining wildfire liability associated with the Wildfire Legislation\n\u25aacatastrophic wildfires caused by SDG&E, or catastrophic wildfires caused by any California electric IOUs that participate in the Wildfire Fund, which could exhaust the fund considerably earlier than expected\nFor SoCalGas, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among other things, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\u25aaSoCalGas\u2019 failure to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\u25aathe conclusion of the CPUC\u2019s pending regulatory proceedings where key elements of SoCalGas\u2019 credit profile are negatively impacted\n\u25aadeterioration of, or uncertainty in, the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in California\n\u25aaa ratings downgrade at Sempra Energy\nA downgrade of Sempra Energy\u2019s or either of the California Utilities\u2019 credit ratings or ratings outlooks, as well as the reasons for such downgrades, may materially and adversely affect the market prices of our equity and debt securities, the interest rates at which borrowings are made and debt securities and commercial paper are issued, and the various fees on credit facilities. This could make it significantly more costly for Sempra Energy, SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra Energy\u2019s other subsidiaries to borrow money, to issue equity or debt securities and commercial paper and to raise other types of capital and/or complete additional financings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and meet our other debt obligations and contractual commitments, and our cash flows, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices, and for those contract positions that are hedged, our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned.\nTo reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments, inventories of natural gas and LNG, natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity. As part of this strategy, we may use forward contracts, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and options. We do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions, and the extent of the coverage to these exposures varies over time. To the extent we have unhedged positions, or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. Certain of the contracts we may use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting, which may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts. In certain cases, these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged.\nRisk management procedures may not prevent or mitigate losses.\nAlthough we have in place risk management and control systems to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended or may not work as planned. In addition, daily value-at-risk and loss limits are primarily based on historic price movements. If prices significantly or persistently deviate\nfrom historic prices, the limits may not protect us from significant losses. As a result of these and other factors, there is no assurance that our risk management procedures and systems will prevent or mitigate losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nMarket performance or changes in other assumptions could require significant unplanned contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nSempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees. A decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans. In addition, the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is affected by other factors, including the assumed rate of return on plan assets, mortality tables, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation. An adverse change in any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur businesses are subject to governmental regulations and tax and accounting requirements and may be materially adversely affected by these regulations or requirements or any changes to them.\nThe electric power and natural gas industries are subject to governmental regulations, and our businesses are also subject to complex accounting and tax requirements. The regulations and requirements that affect us may, from time to time, undergo significant changes on the federal, state, local and foreign levels, including in response to economic or political conditions. Compliance with these regulations and requirements, including in the event of changes to these regulations and requirements or how they are implemented or interpreted, could materially and adversely affect how we conduct our business and increase our operating costs. New tax legislation, regulations or interpretations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate or do business could materially adversely affect our tax expense and/or tax balances, and changes in tax policies could materially adversely impact our businesses. Any failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, including criminal penalties in some cases, and result in the temporary or permanent shutdown of certain facilities and operations. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the California Utilities and other Sempra Energy businesses. These rules are commonly referred to as \u201caffiliate rules,\u201d which primarily impact commodity and commodity-related transactions. These businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or to their interpretations, or by additional CPUC or FERC rules that further restrict our ability to sell natural gas or electricity to, or to trade with, the California Utilities and with each other. Affiliate rules also restrict these businesses from entering into any such transactions with the California Utilities. Any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the LNG facilities, natural gas pipelines, electric generation facilities, or other operations of our subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur businesses require numerous permits, licenses, franchises, and other approvals and agreements from various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, and the failure to obtain or maintain any of them could materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur businesses and operations require numerous permits, licenses, rights-of-way, franchise agreements, certificates and other approvals and agreements from federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. These approvals may not be granted in a timely manner or at all or may be modified, rescinded or fail to be extended by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses or as a result of litigation. For example, SoCalGas\u2019 franchise agreements with the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County are due to expire in December 2021 and June 2023, respectively, and SDG&E\u2019s franchise agreement with the City of San Diego was scheduled to expire in January 2021. SDG&E participated in the City\u2019s competitive bid process for the franchises, which the City subsequently canceled. In December 2020, the City of San Diego and SDG&E agreed to extend the natural gas and electric franchises to June 1, 2021. The extension is intended to provide newly elected City officials time to seek public input and additional information. The City has announced its plan to start a new competitive bid process in the first quarter of 2021. Successfully obtaining, maintaining or renewing any or all of these approvals could result in higher costs or the imposition of conditions or restrictions on the manner in which we operate our businesses. Furthermore, our permits require compliance by us and may require compliance by our underlying customers. Failure by us or our customers to comply with permit, license, right-of-way or franchise requirements could result in these approvals and agreements being modified, suspended\nor rescinded and could subject us to significant fines and penalties. If one or more of these approvals or agreements were to be suspended, rescinded or otherwise terminated, including due to expiration, or be modified in a manner that makes our continued operation of the applicable business prohibitively expensive or otherwise undesirable or impossible, we may be required to temporarily or permanently cease certain of our operations, sell the associated assets or remove them from service, construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area, or any combination of the foregoing, in which case we may lose a significant portion of our rate base or other revenue generating assets, our prospects may be materially adversely affected and we may incur significant impairment charges or other costs that may not be recoverable. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe may invest significant amounts of money in major capital projects prior to receiving regulatory approval. If there is a delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals; if any regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes or other requirements that increase costs or impose restrictions on our existing or planned operations; if we fail to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with them or other applicable laws or regulations; if we are involved in litigation that adversely impacts any required approvals or rights to the applicable property; or if management decides not to proceed with a project, we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project. Any such occurrence could cause our operations and prospects to materially decline and our costs to materially increase, result in material impairments, and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur businesses have significant environmental compliance costs, and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and/or results of operations.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air quality, water quality and usage, wastewater discharge, solid waste management, hazardous waste disposal and remediation, conservation of natural resources, wetlands and wildlife, renewable energy resources, climate change and GHG emissions, among others. To comply with these legal requirements, we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, mitigation costs and emissions fees, and these amounts could increase as a result of various factors that we may not control, including if these legal requirements change, permits are not issued, renewed or amended as anticipated, energy demands increase or our mix of energy supplies changes. Our regulated utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates. In addition, we may be ultimately responsible for all on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our projects and properties, in each case regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown, which exposes us to risks arising from contamination at our former or existing facilities or with respect to off-site waste disposal sites that have been used in our operations. In the case of our regulated utilities, some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates. Our facilities, including those of our JVs, are subject to laws and regulations that have been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to power generation facilities. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines, including criminal penalties in some cases, and/or significant curtailments of our operations, which could materially adversely affect our cash flows and/or results of operations.\nIncreasing international, national, regional and state-level environmental concerns as well as related new or proposed legislation and regulation may have material negative effects on our operations, operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansions or other capital expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects. In particular, existing and potential state, national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of GHG emissions may materially limit operations or otherwise materially adversely affect us. For example, SB 100 requires each California electric utility, including SDG&E, to procure 50% of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2026, and 60% by 2030. SB 100 also creates the policy of meeting all of California\u2019s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS Program-eligible and zero-carbon resources by 2045. The law also includes stipulations that this policy not increase carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid and not allow resource shuffling, and requires that the CPUC, CEC, CARB and other state agencies incorporate this policy into all relevant planning. In addition to signing SB 100 into law, the then-Governor of California also signed an executive order establishing a new statewide goal to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible, and no later than 2045, and achieve and maintain net negative emissions thereafter. The executive order calls on CARB to address this goal in future scoping plans, which affect several major sectors of California\u2019s economy, including transportation, agriculture, development, industrial and others. California recently issued new climate initiatives in line with this statewide goal, including two executive orders requiring sales of all passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035. Our California Utilities and any of our other businesses impacted by similar future laws and regulations may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates or, with respect to our non-regulated utility businesses, if such costs are not able to be passed through to customers. Even if such costs are recoverable, the effects of existing and proposed GHG emission reduction standards may cause rates or other costs to customers to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth, which may have a material adverse effect on the cash flows, performance, businesses and/or prospects of the\nCalifornia Utilities and any of our other affected businesses. SDG&E, as well as any of our other businesses affected by similar mandates in the future, may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met.\nIn addition, existing and future laws, orders and regulations regarding mercury, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, particulates, methane or other emissions, or interpretations or revisions to these laws, orders and regulations, could result in requirements for additional monitoring, pollution monitoring and control equipment, safety practices, other operational changes to satisfy new mandates or emission fees, taxes or penalties, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nOur businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or other proceedings in which we are involved.\nSempra Energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, binding arbitrations and regulatory proceedings, including in connection with the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility natural gas leak that we discuss in further detail below under \u201cRisks Related to the California Utilities - Legal and Regulatory Risks.\u201d We discuss material pending proceedings in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have spent, and continue to spend, substantial amounts of money, time and employee and management focus defending these lawsuits and proceedings and on related investigations and regulatory proceedings. The uncertainties inherent in lawsuits, arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the timing, costs and effects of resolving these matters. In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in personal injury, product liability, property damage and other claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable, in whole or in part, by insurance or in rates from our customers. Any of the foregoing could cause significant reputational damage and materially adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRisks Related to the California Utilities\nOperational Risks\nThe California Utilities are subject to risks arising from the operation, maintenance and upgrade of their natural gas and electricity infrastructure and information technology systems, which, if they materialize, could materially and adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s and the California Utilities\u2019 financial results.\nThe California Utilities own and operate electric transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas transmission, distribution and storage facilities, which are, in many cases, interconnected and/or managed by information technology systems. Even though the California Utilities undertake substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, maintain, improve and upgrade these facilities and systems, there is a risk of, among other things, potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure and information technology systems, human error in operations or maintenance, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental requirements and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels, and these risks could be amplified while capital investment projects are in process. Because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by events occurring on the systems of such third parties, some of which may be unanticipated or uncontrollable by us.\nAdditional risks associated with the ability of the California Utilities to safely and reliably operate, maintain, improve and upgrade their facilities and systems, many of which are beyond the California Utilities\u2019 control, include, among others:\n\u25aafailure to meet customer demand for natural gas and/or electricity, curtailments, controlled or uncontrolled gas outages, or gas surges back into homes that could cause serious personal injury or loss of life\n\u25aaa prolonged widespread electrical black-out that results in damage to the California Utilities\u2019 equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties\n\u25aathe release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water or soil, including gas leaks\n\u25aasevere weather events or natural disasters, pandemics, or attacks by third parties such as cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism or war, the effects of which we discuss above under \u201cRisks Related to All Sempra Energy Businesses - Operational Risks\u201d\n\u25aainadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to catastrophic events that could lead to public or employee harm or extended outages\nThe occurrence of any of these events could affect demand for natural gas or electricity, cause unplanned outages, damage the California Utilities\u2019 assets and/or operations, damage the assets and/or operations of third parties on which the California Utilities rely, damage property owned by customers or others, and cause personal injury or death. Any such events could materially adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s and one or both of the California Utilities\u2019 financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.\nWildfires in California pose a significant risk to the California Utilities\u2019 (particularly SDG&E\u2019s) and Sempra Energy\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nPotential for Increased and More Severe Wildfires\nIn 2020, California experienced some of the largest wildfires (measured by acres burned) in its history. Frequent and more severe drought conditions, inconsistent and extreme swings in precipitation, changes in vegetation caused by these precipitation swings or other factors, unseasonably warm temperatures, very low humidity and stronger winds have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the intensity and prevalence of wildfires in California, including in SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 service territories, and have made these wildfires increasingly difficult to predict and contain. Changing weather patterns, including as a result of climate change, could cause these conditions to become even more extreme and unpredictable. These wildfires could place third-party property and the California Utilities\u2019 electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy and reduce the availability of hydroelectric generators, and these wildfires and the associated weather conditions could result in temporary power shortages in SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 service territories. In addition, certain of California\u2019s local land use policies and forestry management practices have been relaxed to allow for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in high-risk fire areas that may not have the infrastructure or contingency plans necessary to address wildfire risks, which could lead to increased third-party claims and greater losses for which SDG&E or SoCalGas may be liable. We discuss the effects wildfires or other natural disasters could have on our businesses, including the ways in which they could materially adversely affect the California Utilities\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows, in this risk factor below and above under \u201cRisks Related to All Sempra Energy Businesses - Operational Risks.\u201d\nThe Wildfire Legislation\nIn July 2019, the Governor of California signed the Wildfire Legislation into law, which addresses certain important issues related to catastrophic wildfires in the State of California and their impact on electric IOUs (investor-owned gas distribution utilities such as SoCalGas are not covered by this legislation). The issues addressed include wildfire mitigation, cost recovery standards and requirements, a wildfire fund, a cap on liability, safety certifications, and the establishment of a wildfire safety board. The Wildfire Legislation did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation, which imposes strict liability (meaning that liability is imposed regardless of fault) on a utility whose equipment, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, is determined to be a cause of a fire. In such an event, the utility would be responsible for the costs of damages, including potential business interruption losses, as well as interest and attorneys\u2019 fees, even if the utility has not been found negligent. The doctrine of inverse condemnation also is not exclusive of other theories of liability, including if the utility were found negligent, in which case additional liabilities, such as fire suppression, clean-up and evacuation costs, medical expenses, and personal injury, punitive and other damages, could be imposed. The Wildfire Legislation established a revised legal standard for the recovery of wildfire costs (Revised Prudent Manager Standard) and established the Wildfire Fund designed to provide liquidity to participating California electric IOUs to pay wildfire-related claims against a participating IOU in the event that the governmental agency responsible for determining causation determines such IOU\u2019s equipment caused the ignition of a wildfire, primary insurance coverage is exceeded and certain other conditions are satisfied. However, the standards prescribed by the Wildfire Legislation may not be effectively implemented or applied consistently by the State of California or the Wildfire Fund could be completely exhausted due to fires in other California IOUs\u2019 service territories, by fires in SDG&E\u2019s service territory or by a combination thereof, which could impact our ability to timely access capital necessary to address, in whole or in part, inverse condemnation and other liabilities. Although SDG&E is not aware of any claims made against the Wildfire Fund by any participating IOU, there is no assurance that one or more participating IOUs will not submit claims against the Wildfire Fund in connection with any past or future wildfires. As a result, we are unable to predict whether the Wildfire Legislation will be effectively implemented or consistently applied or its impact on SDG&E\u2019s ability to recover certain costs and expenses in the event that SDG&E\u2019s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire, and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation. If a major fire is determined to be caused by SDG&E\u2019s equipment, or if a major fire is determined to be caused by another California electric IOU and the Wildfire Fund is depleted as a result, Sempra Energy\u2019s and SDG&E\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nCost Recovery Through Insurance or Rates\nWe have experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could be caused by the California Utilities\u2019 operations, particularly SDG&E\u2019s operations, and these conditions could continue or worsen. As a result of the strict liability standard applied to electric IOU-caused wildfires in California, substantial recent losses recorded by insurance companies, and the risk of an increase in the number and size of wildfires, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be available or may be available only at rates that are prohibitively expensive. In addition, the insurance that has been obtained for wildfire liabilities and the insurance for these liabilities that may be available in the future, if any, may not be sufficient to cover all losses that we may incur, or it may not be available in sufficient amounts to meet the $1 billion of primary insurance required by the Wildfire Legislation. Uninsured losses may not be recoverable in customer rates and increases in the cost of insurance may be challenged when we seek cost recovery through the regulatory process. We are unable to predict whether we would be allowed to recover in rates or from the Wildfire Fund the costs of any uninsured losses. A loss which is not fully insured, sufficiently covered by the Wildfire Fund and/or cannot be recovered in customer rates, such as the CPUC decision denying SDG&E\u2019s recovery of costs related to wildfires in its service territory in 2007, could materially adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s and one or both of the California Utilities\u2019 financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.\nWildfire Mitigation Efforts\nAlthough we spend significant resources on measures designed to mitigate wildfire risks, there is no assurance that these measures will be successful or effective in reducing our wildfire-related losses or that their costs will be fully recoverable in rates. The California Utilities are required by applicable California law to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the Wildfire Safety Division of the CPUC and could be subject to increased risks if these plans are not approved in a timely manner and fines or penalties for any failure to comply with the approved plans. One of our wildfire mitigation tools is to de-energize certain of our facilities when weather conditions become extreme and there is elevated wildfire ignition risk, in an effort to help mitigate this safety risk to the public. Such \u201cpublic safety power shutoffs\u201d have been subject to significant scrutiny by various stakeholders, including customers, regulators and law makers, that could lead to legislation or rulemaking that increases the risk of penalties and liability for damages associated with these events. Such costs may not be recoverable in rates. Unrecoverable costs, adverse legislation or rulemaking, scrutiny by key stakeholders or other negative effects associated with wildfire mitigation efforts could materially adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s and SDG&E\u2019s financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.\nThe electricity industry is undergoing significant change, including increased deployment of distributed energy resources, technological advancements, and political and regulatory developments.\nElectric utilities in California are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources, such as solar generation, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response technologies, and California\u2019s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of these industry changes. This growth of distributed energy resources will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate increasing two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid\u2019s capacity to interconnect distributed energy resources. Moreover, enabling California\u2019s clean energy goals will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options and electric vehicle infrastructure. The CPUC is conducting proceedings to: evaluate various projects and pilots; implement changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources; consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources; determine what, if any, compensation would be feasible and appropriate; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. These proceedings and the broader changes in California\u2019s electricity industry could result in new regulations, policies and/or operational changes that could materially adversely affect SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nSDG&E provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a long-term basis. While SDG&E currently provides such procurement service for most of its customer load, customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than SDG&E, through programs such as DA and CCA. DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours and CCA is only available if a customer\u2019s local jurisdiction (city) offers such a program. Several local jurisdictions, including the City and County of San Diego and other municipalities, have implemented, are implementing or are considering implementing CCA, which could result in SDG&E providing procurement service for less than half of its current customer load as early as December 31, 2021. When customers are served by another load serving entity, SDG&E no longer procures electricity for this departing load and the associated costs of the utility\u2019s procured resources could then be borne by SDG&E\u2019s remaining bundled procurement customers. Existing state law requires that customers opting to have CCA procure their electricity must absorb the cost of above-market electricity procurement commitments already made by SDG&E on their behalf, which requirements are designed to equitably share costs among customers served by SDG&E and\ncustomers served by DA and CCA. If adequate mechanisms are not implemented to help ensure compliance with state law or if state law changes, remaining bundled customers of SDG&E could potentially experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of CCA customers prior to their departure or, if all such costs are not recoverable in rates, SDG&E could experience material increases in its unrecoverable commodity costs. If legislative, regulatory or legal action is taken that has the effect of preventing or delaying recovery of these procurement costs or if mechanisms are not in place to help ensure compliance with state law, the unrecovered costs could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nNatural gas and natural gas storage have increasingly been the subject of political and public scrutiny, including a desire by some to substantially reduce or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source.\nCertain California legislators and stakeholder, advocacy and activist groups have expressed a desire to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source by advocating increased use of renewable electricity and electrification in lieu of the use of natural gas. Certain California state agencies have recently proposed public policies that would prohibit or restrict the use and consumption of natural gas, for example in new buildings and appliances, and certain local city governments have passed ordinances restricting use of natural gas connections in newly constructed buildings. These proposals and ordinances and any other similar regulatory action could have the effect of reducing natural gas use over time. In addition, CARB, California\u2019s primary regulator for GHG emission reduction programs, has published plans for reducing GHG emissions in line with California\u2019s climate goals that include proposals to reduce natural gas demand, including more aggressive energy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use, increased renewable generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, and replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances. CARB\u2019s plans also propose that some conventional natural gas be displaced with above-market renewable natural gas, which could result in increased costs that may not be fully recoverable in rates, and CARB is currently considering updates to its GHG reduction plans, which are due to be finalized in 2022, that could further reduce natural gas demand. The CPUC has initiated an OIR to update gas reliability standards, determine the regulatory changes necessary to improve coordination between natural gas utilities and natural gas-fired electric generators, and implement a long-term planning strategy to manage the state\u2019s transition away from natural gas-fueled technologies to meet California\u2019s decarbonization goals. The OIR will be conducted in two phases, the first of which is addressing reliability standards and coordination between natural gas utilities and natural gas-fired electric generators, and the second of which will implement a long-term planning strategy. A substantial reduction or the elimination of natural gas as an energy source in California could lead to certain of SoCalGas\u2019 and SDG&E\u2019s gas assets no longer meeting CPUC standards to recover costs and earn an associated rate of return, thus potentially causing our substantial investment in the value of these gas assets to be depreciated on an accelerated basis or become stranded, and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019, SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nSDG&E may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility that is being decommissioned.\nSDG&E has a 20% ownership interest in SONGS, formerly a 2,150-MW nuclear generating facility near San Clemente, California, that is in the process of being decommissioned by Edison, the majority owner of SONGS. SDG&E, and each of the other owners, is responsible for financing its share of expenses and capital expenditures, including decommissioning activities. Although the facility is being decommissioned, SDG&E\u2019s ownership interest in SONGS continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility, which include, among other things:\n\u25aathe potential release of a radioactive material, including from a natural disaster, that could cause catastrophic harm to human health and the environment\n\u25aathe potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the prior operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials\n\u25aalimitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with operations and the decommissioning of the facility\n\u25aauncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning the facility\nIn addition, SDG&E maintains NDTs for providing funds to decommission SONGS. Trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities, which are subject to significant market fluctuations. A decline in the market value of trust assets, an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts, or changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment could increase the funding requirements for these trusts, which costs in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates. Furthermore, CPUC approval is required in order to make withdrawals from these trusts. CPUC approval for certain expenditures may be denied altogether if the CPUC determines that the expenditures are unreasonable. In addition, decommissioning may be materially more expensive than\nwe currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the trust funds. Rate recovery for overruns would require CPUC approval, which may not occur.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could result in a substantial reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nWe discuss SONGS further in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe California Utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state, federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities, which may materially adversely affect us.\nRates and Other Capital-Related Matters\nThe CPUC regulates the California Utilities\u2019 customer rates, except for SDG&E\u2019s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the FERC. The CPUC also regulates, among other matters, the California Utilities\u2019:\n\u25aaconditions of service\n\u25aasales of securities\n\u25aarates of return\n\u25aacapital structure\n\u25aarates of depreciation\n\u25aalong-term resource procurement\nThe CPUC periodically approves the California Utilities\u2019 customer rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs, including income taxes, and an authorized rate of return on investments, as well as settlements with third parties, while incorporating a risk-based decision-making framework. The outcome of ratemaking proceedings can be affected by various factors, many of which are not in our control, including, among others, the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of applicable regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations and customers about the California Utilities\u2019 ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. These ratemaking proceedings include decisions about major programs in which SoCalGas and SDG&E make significant investments under an approved CPUC framework, but which investments may remain subject to a CPUC reasonableness review or filing that could result in the disallowance of a portion of the incurred costs. The California Utilities also may be required to incur costs and make investments to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs, energy storage and renewable energy targets, gas distribution and transmission safety and integrity, and underground gas storage, among others. The California Utilities\u2019 ability to recover these costs and investments depends in part on the final form of the legislative or regulatory requirements and the ratemaking mechanisms associated with them, and could also be impacted by the timing and process of the ratemaking mechanism, in which there is a potentially significant time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers\u2019 rates and there could be potentially material differences between the forecasted or authorized costs embedded in rates (which are set on a prospective basis) and the amount of actual costs incurred. The cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects of Sempra Energy and each of the California Utilities may be materially adversely affected by their rates, which can be impacted by, among other things:\n\u25aadelays by the CPUC on decisions regarding recovery\n\u25aathe results of after-the-fact reasonableness reviews with unclear standards\n\u25aafinalization of legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives in an unexpected manner\n\u25aarejection of settlements with third parties\n\u25aadecisions denying recovery or authorizing less than full recovery on the basis that costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons\n\u25aaactual capital expenditures or operating costs exceeding the amounts approved by the CPUC\nIn addition, changes in key benchmark interest rates may trigger automatic adjustment mechanisms that determine the California Utilities\u2019 authorized rates of return. Specifically, the CCM considers changes in interest rates based on the applicable 12-month average Moody\u2019s utility bond index. If triggered, the CCM would automatically update the California Utilities\u2019 authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and authorized ROE upward or downward by one-half of the difference between the CCM benchmark\nand the applicable 12-month average Moody\u2019s utility bond index. For the 12-months ended September 30, 2020, SDG&E and SoCalGas were close to their respective benchmark rates but did not trigger the CCM. Interest rates referenced in the applicable Moody\u2019s utility bond indices have been more than 100 bps below the benchmark since the beginning of the current measurement period. If these interest rates remain at current levels through the remainder of the current measurement period, a triggering event for SDG&E and SoCalGas could occur. A trigger of the CCM in 2021 that requires a downward adjustment could materially adversely affect the results of operations and cash flows of Sempra Energy and, depending on the CCM that is triggered, SDG&E and SoCalGas, beginning January 1, 2022. We discuss the CCM further in \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business - Ratemaking Mechanisms - California Utilities - Cost of Capital Proceedings\u201d and in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets, and other similar matters involving SDG&E. These ratemaking mechanisms are subject to many risks similar to those described above regarding the CPUC.\nCPUC Authority Over Operational Matters\nThe CPUC has regulatory authority related to utility operations, safety standards and practices, competitive conditions, reliability and planning, affiliate relationships and a wide range of other matters, including citation programs concerning matters such as safety activity, disconnection and billing practices, resource adequacy and environmental compliance. Many of these standards and programs are becoming more stringent and could impose severe penalties. For example, SDG&E and SoCalGas are subject to a safety enforcement program developed by the CPUC pursuant to SB 291 that includes procedures for monitoring, data tracking and analysis, and investigations, and delegates citation authority to CPUC staff under the direction of the CPUC Executive Director. The CPUC staff has authority to issue citations up to an administrative limit of $8 million per citation under this program, and penalties issued by the CPUC under the program can exceed this administrative limit, having exceeded $1.5 billion in one instance for an unrelated third party. The CPUC conducts various reviews and audits of the matters under its authority, including compliance with CPUC regulations, and could launch investigations or open proceedings at any time on any issue it deems appropriate, the results of which could lead to citations, disallowances, fines and penalties. Any such citations, disallowances, fines or penalties for noncompliance with any CPUC regulations, programs or standards, as well as any corrective or mitigation actions required to become in compliance if not sufficiently funded in customer rates, could have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy\u2019s and the California Utilities\u2019 results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss various CPUC proceedings relating to the California Utilities\u2019 rates, costs, incentive mechanisms and performance-based regulation in Notes 4, 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInfluence of Other Organizations and Potential Regulatory Changes\nThe California Utilities and Sempra Energy may be materially adversely affected by revisions or reinterpretations of existing or new legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies, any of which could change how the California Utilities operate, affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, or require them to incur substantial additional expenses.\nThe California Utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as Cal PA, TURN, Utility Consumers\u2019 Action Network, Sierra Club and other stakeholder, advocacy and activist groups. To the extent that any of these groups are successful in directly or indirectly influencing the California Utilities\u2019 operations, this could have a material adverse effect on the California Utilities\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nSoCalGas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs, expenses and other liabilities related to the Leak, a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance.\nFrom October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced a natural gas leak from one of the injection-and-withdrawal wells, SS25, at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles County. As described in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, numerous lawsuits, investigations and regulatory proceedings have been initiated in response to the Leak, resulting in significant costs.\nCivil and Criminal Litigation\nAs of February 22, 2021, 395 lawsuits, including approximately 36,000 plaintiffs, are pending against SoCalGas related to the Leak, some of which have also named Sempra Energy. All these cases, other than a matter brought by the Los Angeles County District Attorney and the federal securities class action discussed below, are coordinated before a single court in the LA Superior Court for pretrial management. The initial trial previously scheduled for June 2020 for a small number of randomly selected individual plaintiffs was postponed, with a new trial date yet to be determined by the court.\nFour shareholder derivative actions were filed alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain officers and certain directors of Sempra Energy and/or SoCalGas. Three of the actions were joined in an Amended Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint, which was dismissed with prejudice in January 2021. The remaining action was also dismissed but plaintiffs were given leave to amend their complaint.\nA misdemeanor criminal complaint was filed by the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s office, as to which SoCalGas entered a settlement that was approved by the LA Superior Court; challenges by certain residents have been rejected by the California Supreme Court.\nAdditional litigation, including by public entities, and criminal complaints may be filed against us related to the Leak or our responses thereto.\nThe costs of defending against or settling or otherwise resolving the civil and criminal lawsuits, and any compensatory, statutory or punitive damages, restitution, and civil, administrative and criminal fines, penalties and other costs, if awarded or imposed, as well as the costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released, could be significant. We discuss these risks further above under \u201cRisks Related to All Sempra Energy Businesses - Legal and Regulatory Risks\u201d and in this risk factor below under \u201cInsurance and Estimated Costs.\u201d\nGovernmental Investigations, Orders and Additional Regulation\nIn January 2016, CalGEM and the CPUC selected Blade to conduct, under their supervision, an independent analysis of the technical root cause of the Leak, to be funded by SoCalGas. The root cause analysis was released in May 2019 and did not identify any instances of non-compliance by SoCalGas and concluded that SoCalGas\u2019 compliance activities conducted prior to the Leak did not find indications of a casing integrity issue, but also opined that there were measures, though not required by gas storage regulations at the time, that could have been taken to aid in the early identification of corrosion and that, in Blade\u2019s opinion, would have prevented or mitigated the Leak.\nIn June 2019, the CPUC opened an OII to consider penalties against SoCalGas for the Leak. The first phase will consider whether SoCalGas violated applicable laws, CPUC orders or decisions, rules or requirements, whether SoCalGas engaged in unreasonable and/or imprudent practices with respect to its operation and maintenance of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility or its related record-keeping practices, whether SoCalGas cooperated sufficiently with the SED and Blade during the pre-formal investigation, and whether any of the mitigation proposed by Blade should be implemented to the extent not already done. In November 2019, the SED, based largely on the Blade report, alleged a total of 330 violations, asserting that SoCalGas violated California Public Utilities Code Section 451 and failed to cooperate in the investigation and to keep proper records. Hearings on a subset of issues are scheduled to begin in March 2021. The second phase will consider whether SoCalGas should be sanctioned for the Leak and what damages, fines or other penalties or sanctions, if any, should be imposed for any violations unreasonable or imprudent practices, or failure to sufficiently cooperate with the SED as determined by the CPUC in the first phase. In addition, the second phase will determine the amounts of various costs incurred by SoCalGas and other parties in connection with the Leak and the ratemaking treatment or other disposition of such costs, which could result in little or no recovery of such costs by SoCalGas. SoCalGas has engaged in settlement discussions with the SED in connection with this proceeding.\nHigher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by SoCalGas as a result of these investigations or new laws, orders, rules and regulations arising out of this incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates. In addition, any of these investigations could result in findings of violations of laws, orders, rules or regulations as well as fines and penalties, any of which could cause significant reputational damage. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nNatural Gas Storage Operations and Reliability\nNatural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods, including peak electric generation needs in the summer and consumer heating needs in the winter. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility is the largest SoCalGas storage facility and an important element of SoCalGas\u2019 delivery system. As a result of the Leak, SoCalGas suspended injection of natural gas into the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility beginning in October 2015 and, following a comprehensive safety review and authorization by CalGEM and the CPUC\u2019s Executive Director, resumed injection operations in July 2017 based on limited operating ranges for the field. In February 2017, the CPUC opened a proceeding pursuant to SB 380 OII to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, including considering alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility\u2019s services if it were eliminated.\nIf the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed, or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, it could result in an impairment of the facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs and/or additional capital expenditures, and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized. At December 31, 2020, the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of $821 million. Any significant impairment of this asset, or higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by SoCalGas that may not be recoverable in customer rates, could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nInsurance and Estimated Costs\nAt December 31, 2020, SoCalGas estimates certain costs related to the Leak are $1,627 million (the cost estimate), which includes the $1,279 million of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance. This cost estimate may increase significantly as more information becomes available. A substantial portion of the cost estimate has been paid, and $451 million is accrued as Reserve for Aliso Canyon Costs as of December 31, 2020 on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe actions against us related to the Leak as described in this risk factor above under \u201cCivil and Criminal Litigation\u201d seek compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, restitution, and civil, administrative and criminal fines, penalties and other costs. In addition, we could be subject to damages, fines, or other penalties or sanctions as a result of the investigations and other matters described in this risk factor above under \u201cGovernmental Investigations, Orders and Additional Regulation.\u201d Except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions, as described in this risk factor above under \u201cCivil and Criminal Litigation,\u201d the cost estimate does not include litigation, regulatory proceedings or regulatory costs to the extent it is not possible to predict at this time the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the costs to defend or resolve the actions or the amount of damages, restitution, or civil, administrative or criminal fines, sanctions, penalties or other costs or remedies that may be imposed or incurred. The cost estimate also does not include certain other costs incurred by Sempra Energy associated with defending against shareholder derivative lawsuits and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate. These costs not included in the cost estimate could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have received insurance payments for many of the costs included in the cost estimate, and we intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for all other costs we have incurred. Other than insurance for certain future defense costs we may incur as well as directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability, we have exhausted all of our insurance in this matter. We continue to pursue other sources of insurance coverage for costs related to this matter, but we may not be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for any of these costs. If we are not able to secure additional insurance recovery, if any costs we have recorded as an insurance receivable are not collected, if there are delays in receiving insurance recoveries, or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible, such amounts, which could be significant, could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional Information\nWe discuss Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility matters further in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe failure by the CPUC to adequately reform SDG&E\u2019s rate structure, including the implementation of charges independent of consumption volume and measures to reduce NEM rate subsidies, could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe NEM program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of on-site renewable generation (primarily solar installations) for residential and business customers. Under NEM, qualifying customer-generators receive a full retail rate for the energy they generate that is fed to the utility\u2019s power grid. This occurs during times when the customer\u2019s generation exceeds their own energy usage. Under this structure, NEM customers do not pay their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, subject to certain exceptions, while they still receive electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. The unpaid NEM costs are subsidized by customers not participating in NEM. Accordingly, as more electric-use customers and higher electric-use residential customers switch to NEM and self-generate energy, the burden on the remaining customers increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation, further increasing rate pressure on existing non-NEM customers.\nThe current electric residential rate structure in California is primarily based on consumption volume, which places a higher rate burden on customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers. In July 2015, the CPUC adopted a decision that provided a framework for rates that could be more transparent, fair and sustainable. The framework provides for a minimum\nmonthly bill, fewer rate tiers and a gradual reduction in the differences between the tiered rates, and directs the utilities to pursue expanded time-of-use rates. Most elements of the framework were implemented in 2020 and should result in some relief for higher-use customers and a rate structure that better aligns rates with actual costs to serve customers. The decision also established a process for electric utilities to seek implementation of a fixed charge for residential customers, subject to certain conditions; however, in March 2020, the CPUC adopted a decision rejecting electric utilities\u2019 requests to establish a fixed residential charge. The decision allows the utilities to renew their requests for a fixed charge at a later date if such proposals include an adequate customer outreach and communications plan. In August 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking to further develop a successor to the existing NEM tariff. We expect a decision establishing a successor tariff to be issued in the fourth quarter of 2021, with implementation of the successor tariff by January 2022. Depending on the structure and functionality of such a successor tariff, which is uncertain, the current risks associated with the existing NEM tariff could continue or increase.\nSDG&E believes the establishment of a charge independent of consumption volume for residential customers is critical to help ensure rates are distributed among all customers that rely on the electric transmission and distribution system, including those participating in the NEM program. In addition, distributed energy resources and energy efficiency initiatives could generally reduce delivered volumes, increasing the importance of a fixed charge. The absence of a charge independent of consumption volume coupled with the continuing increase of solar installation and other forms of self-generation could adversely impact electricity rates and the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system, which could subject SDG&E to higher levels of customer dissatisfaction, increased likelihood of noncompliance with CPUC or other safety or operational standards, and increased risks attendant to any such noncompliance as we discuss above under \u201cRisks Related to the California Utilities - Legal and Regulatory Risks,\u201d and also could increase SDG&E\u2019s costs, including power procurement, operating or capital costs, and increase the likelihood of disallowance of recovery for these costs.\nIf the CPUC fails to adequately reform SDG&E\u2019s rate structure to better achieve reasonable, cost-based electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system, such failure could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Interest in Oncor\nCertain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management and policies of Oncor.\nVarious \u201cring-fencing\u201d measures are in place to enhance Oncor\u2019s separateness from its owners and to mitigate the risk that Oncor would be negatively impacted in the event of a bankruptcy or other adverse financial developments affecting its owners. This ring-fence creates both legal and financial separation between Oncor Holdings, Oncor and their subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sempra Energy and its affiliates and subsidiaries, on the other hand.\nIn accordance with the ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments we established in connection with our acquisition of an 80.25% indirect interest in Oncor in March 2018, we and Oncor are subject to various restrictions, including, among others:\n\u25aaseven members of Oncor\u2019s 13-person board of directors will be independent directors in all material respects under the rules of the NYSE in relation to Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities and any other direct or indirect owners of Oncor, and also will have no material relationship with Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities or any other direct or indirect owners of Oncor currently or within the previous 10 years. With respect to the six remaining directors, two will be designated by Sempra Energy, two will be designated by Oncor\u2019s minority owner, TTI, and two will be current or former Oncor officers\n\u25aaOncor will not pay any dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if a majority of its independent directors or any of the directors appointed by TTI determines that it is in the best interests of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements\n\u25aaOncor will not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if that payment would cause its debt-to-equity ratio to exceed the debt-to-equity ratio approved by the PUCT\n\u25aaif Oncor\u2019s senior secured debt credit rating by any of the three major rating agencies falls below BBB (or Baa2 for Moody\u2019s), Oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT\n\u25aathere must be maintained certain \u201cseparateness measures\u201d that reinforce the legal and financial separation of Oncor from Sempra Energy, including a requirement that dealings between Oncor and Sempra Energy or Sempra Energy\u2019s affiliates (other than Oncor Holdings and its subsidiaries) must be on an arm\u2019s-length basis, limitations on affiliate transactions and a prohibition on pledging Oncor assets or stock for any entity other than Oncor\n\u25aaa majority of Oncor\u2019s independent directors and the directors designated by TTI that are present and voting (of which at least one must be present and voting) must approve any annual or multi-year budget if the aggregate amount of capital expenditures or O&M in such budget is more than a 10% increase or decrease from the corresponding amounts of such expenditures in the budget for the preceding fiscal year or multi-year period, as applicable\n\u25aaSempra Energy will continue to hold indirectly at least 51% of the ownership interests in Oncor Holdings and Oncor until at least March 9, 2023, unless otherwise specifically authorized by the PUCT\nAs a result, we do not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and we have limited ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends, strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions. We have limited representation on the Oncor Holdings and Oncor boards of directors, which are each controlled by independent directors. Moreover, all directors of Oncor, including those directors we have appointed, have considerable autonomy and, as described in our commitments, have a duty to act in the best interest of Oncor consistent with the approved ring-fence and Delaware law, which may in certain cases be contrary to our best interests or be in opposition to our preferred strategic direction for Oncor. To the extent that the directors approve or Oncor otherwise pursues actions that are not in our interests, the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects of Sempra Energy may be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in the electric utility industry, including changes in regulation of ERCOT, could materially adversely affect Oncor\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects, which could materially adversely affect us.\nOncor operates in the electric utility sector and is subject to various legislative requirements and regulations by U.S., Texas and regional and local authorities. As a result, it is subject to many of the same or similar risks as our California Utilities as we describe above under \u201cRisks Related to the California Utilities.\u201d The costs and burdens associated with complying with these requirements and adjusting Oncor\u2019s business and operations in response to legislative and regulatory developments, including changes in ERCOT, and any fines or penalties that could result from any noncompliance, may have a material adverse effect on Oncor. Moreover, potential legislative, regulatory or market or industry changes may jeopardize the predictability of utility earnings generally. In February 2021, following extreme winter weather, the PUCT issued a moratorium on customer disconnections due to nonpayment and could take other similar measures to address financial challenges experienced by other ERCOT market participants, which could adversely impact Oncor\u2019s collections and cash flows and, in turn, could adversely impact us. Also in February 2021, ERCOT required transmission companies, including Oncor, to significantly reduce demand on the grid due to insufficient electricity generation caused by extreme winter weather, resulting in power outages throughout ERCOT. The Governor of Texas has declared reform of ERCOT as an emergency item for the current Texas Legislative session. Various regulatory and governmental entities have indicated an intent to investigate the operation of the ERCOT grid during this extreme winter weather event and additional inquiries could also arise. Any significant changes relating to the ERCOT market that impact transmission and distribution utilities as a result of such proceedings or otherwise could materially adversely impact Oncor. If Oncor does not successfully respond to these changes and any other legislative, regulatory, or market or industry changes applicable to it, Oncor could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOncor\u2019s operations are capital intensive and it could have liquidity needs that necessitate additional investments in Oncor.\nOncor\u2019s business is capital intensive, and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. In the past, Oncor has financed a substantial portion of its cash needs from operations and with proceeds from indebtedness, but these sources of capital may not be adequate in the future. Our commitments to the PUCT prohibit us from making loans to Oncor. As a result, if Oncor fails to meet its capital requirements or if Oncor is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs, we may elect to make additional capital contributions to Oncor. Any such investments could be substantial and would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.\nSempra Energy could incur substantial tax liabilities if EFH\u2019s 2016 spin-off of Vistra from EFH is deemed to be taxable.\nAs part of its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, in 2016, EFH distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary Vistra Energy Corp. (formerly TCEH Corp. and referred to herein as Vistra) to certain creditors of TCEH LLC (the spin-off), and Vistra became an independent, publicly traded company. Vistra\u2019s spin-off from EFH was intended to qualify for partially tax-free treatment to EFH and its shareholders under Sections 368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the IRC (collectively referred to as the Intended Tax Treatment). In connection with and as a condition to the spin-off, EFH received a private letter ruling from\nthe IRS regarding certain issues relating to the Intended Tax Treatment of the spin-off, as well as tax opinions from counsel to EFH and Vistra regarding certain aspects of the spin-off not covered by the private letter ruling.\nIn connection with the signing and closing of the merger of EFH with an indirect subsidiary of Sempra Energy, with EFH continuing as the surviving company and as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra Energy (the Merger), EFH sought and received a supplemental private letter ruling from the IRS and Sempra Energy and EFH received tax opinions from their respective counsels that generally provide that the Merger will not affect the conclusions reached in, respectively, the IRS private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spin-off described above. Similar to the IRS private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spin-off, the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS and any opinions issued with respect to the Merger are based on factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings, made by Sempra Energy and EFH, now Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. and a subsidiary of Sempra Energy. If such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete, any such undertakings are not complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions (which will not impact the IRS position on the transactions) are based are different from the actual facts relating to the Merger, the tax opinions and/or supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and as a result, could be challenged by the IRS. Even though Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. would have administrative appeal rights if the IRS were to invalidate its private letter ruling and/or supplemental private letter ruling, including the right to challenge any adverse IRS position in court, any such appeal would be subject to significant uncertainties and could fail. If it is ultimately determined that the Merger caused the spin-off not to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, Sempra Energy, through its ownership of Sempra Texas Holdings Corp., could incur substantial tax liabilities, which would materially reduce and potentially eliminate the value associated with our indirect investment in Oncor and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects of Sempra Energy and on the market value of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nRisks Related to Our Businesses Other Than the California Utilities and Our Interest in Oncor\nOperational Risks\nProject development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled, be completed within budget or operate at expected levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nAll Energy Infrastructure Projects\nWe are involved in a number of energy infrastructure projects, including natural gas liquefaction facilities; marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels and LPG terminals and storage; natural gas, propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities; electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure; and other projects. The acquisition, development, construction and expansion of these projects involve numerous risks.\nWe may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, fuel supply, infrastructure development, legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built. If the project is not completed, we may have to impair or write off amounts that we have invested in project development and never receive any return on these preliminary investments.\nSuccess in developing a project is contingent upon, among other things:\n\u25aaour ability to reach a final investment decision or otherwise make progress with respect to any project, which may be dependent on our financial condition and cash flows and may be influenced by a number of external factors outside our control, including the global economy and global energy and financial markets\n\u25aanegotiation of satisfactory EPC agreements, including any renegotiation of total contract price and other terms that may be required in the event of delays in final investment decisions or other failures to meet specified deadlines with respect to a project\n\u25aaif we intend to have equity partners in the project, identification of suitable partners and negotiation of satisfactory equity agreements\n\u25aaidentification of suitable customers and negotiation of satisfactory LNG offtake or other customer agreements\n\u25aanegotiation of satisfactory supply, natural gas and LNG sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements and PPAs\n\u25aatimely receipt of required governmental permits, licenses and other authorizations that do not impose material conditions and are otherwise granted under terms we find reasonable, as well as maintenance of these authorizations\n\u25aaour project partners\u2019 willingness and financial or other ability to make their required investments on a timely basis\n\u25aaour contractors and other counterparties\u2019 willingness and financial or other ability to fulfill their contractual commitments\n\u25aatimely, satisfactory and on-budget completion of construction, which could be negatively affected by engineering problems, adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters, pandemics, cyber- or other attacks by third parties, work stoppages, equipment unavailability, contractor performance shortfalls and a variety of other factors, many of which we discuss above under \u201cRisks Related to All Sempra Energy Businesses - Operational Risks\u201d and in this risk factor below\n\u25aaobtaining adequate and reasonably priced financing for the project\n\u25aathe absence of hidden defects or inherited environmental liabilities for any brownfield project construction\n\u25aafast and cost-effective resolution of any litigation or unsettled property rights affecting a project\nAny failures with respect to the above factors or other factors material to any particular project could involve significant additional costs to us and otherwise materially adversely affect the successful completion of a project. If we are unable to complete a development project, if we experience substantial delays, or if construction, financing or other project costs exceed our estimated budgets and we are required to make additional capital contributions, our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nThe operation of existing facilities, such as Cameron LNG JV\u2019s Phase 1 facility, and any future projects we are able to complete involves many risks, including, among others, the potential for unforeseen design flaws, engineering challenges, equipment failures or the breakdown for other reasons of liquefaction, regasification and storage facilities, electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure or other equipment or processes; labor disputes; fuel interruption; environmental contamination; and operating performance below expected levels. In addition, weather-related incidents and other natural disasters, pandemics, cyber- or other attacks by third parties and other similar events can disrupt liquefaction, generation, regasification, storage, transmission and distribution systems and have other impacts that we discuss above under \u201cRisks Related to All Sempra Energy Businesses - Operational Risks.\u201d The occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idle for an extended period of time or our facilities operating below expected capacity levels, which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs and penalties. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nLNG Export Projects\nIn addition to the risks described above that are applicable to all our energy infrastructure projects, we are exposed to additional risks in connection with our LNG export projects, including Cameron LNG JV\u2019s Phase 1 project and our potential development of additional LNG export facilities. Sempra LNG is in discussions with the co-owners of Cameron LNG JV regarding the potential expansion of the facility in Phase 2 to include up to two additional liquefaction trains, is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction export project near Port Arthur, Texas, and, through a JV agreement with IEnova, is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction export project at IEnova\u2019s existing ECA Regas Facility in Baja California, Mexico to be developed in two phases (a mid-scale project referred to as ECA LNG Phase 1 and a large-scale project referred to as ECA LNG Phase 2). These projects are at various stages of development, and we have only reached a final investment decision with respect to ECA LNG Phase 1, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020. We discuss each of our LNG export projects further in \u201cPart II - Item 7. MD&A - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Sempra LNG.\u201d\nEach of these projects faces numerous risks and must overcome significant hurdles. Our ability to reach a final investment decision for each project and, if such a decision is reached and a project is completed, the overall success of such project are dependent on global energy markets, including natural gas and oil supply, demand and pricing. In general, a shift in the supply of natural gas could depress LNG prices and the cost advantages of exporting LNG from the U.S. In addition, global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections could reduce the demand for natural gas in some sectors and cause a corresponding reduction in projected global demand for LNG. Such a reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation, or as a result of calls by some to limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source globally. Any of these developments could result in increased or decreased competition and impact prospects for developing projects in an environment of declining LNG demand, and could negatively affect the performance and prospects of any of our projects that are or become operational. Moreover, if and as our development projects become operational, such projects could become competitive against each other, which would harm the overall success of our LNG export strategy. At certain moderate levels, oil prices could also make LNG projects in other parts of the world more feasible and competitive with LNG projects in North America, thus increasing supply and competition for the available LNG demand. A decline in natural gas prices outside the U.S. (which in many foreign countries are based on the price of crude oil) may also materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas (based on Henry Hub pricing), which could further decrease demand for domestic LNG and increase competition among LNG project developers.\nThere are a number of potential new LNG projects in addition to ours that are under construction or in the process of development by various project developers in North America, and given the projected global demand for LNG and the inherent risks of these projects, the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed. Our proposed projects may face distinct disadvantages relative to some of the other projects under construction or in development. For example:\n\u25aaOur Port Arthur, Texas project is a greenfield site, and therefore it does not have some of the advantages often associated with brownfield sites. Some of these disadvantages include increased costs and time to construct, which could materially adversely affect the development of this project.\n\u25aaThe proposed expansion of the Cameron LNG JV facility (Phase 2) is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the project financing agreements for Phase 1 of the project, including, among others, timing restrictions unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the project lenders, and requires unanimous consent of all JV partners, including with respect to the equity investment obligations of each partner. There is no assurance that these conditions and requirements can be satisfied, in which case our ability to develop the Phase 2 project would be jeopardized.\n\u25aaThe ECA Regas Facility, the ECA LNG Phase 1 liquefaction export project under construction and the potential ECA LNG Phase 2 liquefaction export project in Mexico are subject to ongoing land and permit disputes that could make finding or maintaining suitable partners and customers, difficult, and could also hinder or halt construction and, if the project is completed, operations. We discuss these risks further below under \u201cRisks Related to Our Businesses Other Than the California Utilities and Our Interest in Oncor - Legal and Regulatory Risks.\u201d In addition, while we have completed the regulatory process for this LNG export facility in the U.S., the regulatory process in Mexico and the overlay of U.S. regulations for natural gas exports to an LNG export facility in Mexico are not well developed. We experienced significant delays obtaining a necessary export permit from the Mexican government for the ECA LNG Phase 1 liquefaction export project, due in part to government closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in material delays in our ability to reach a final investment decision for this project, and we could experience similar delays or face other hurdles in obtaining, renewing or maintaining all necessary permits and other approvals from the Mexican government for projects in the future. As a result, there is no assurance that the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project will be constructed and operated without facing significant regulatory challenges and uncertainties, or at all, which in turn could make project financing, as well as finding or maintaining suitable partners and customers for the ECA LNG Phase 2 project difficult. Finally, we have planned measures to not disrupt operations at the ECA Regas Facility with the construction of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. However, this is not the case with respect to the construction of the ECA LNG Phase 2 project, which we expect may conflict with the current operations at the ECA Regas Facility. The ECA Regas Facility currently has long-term regasification contracts for 100% of the regasification facility\u2019s capacity through 2028, making the decision on whether and how to pursue the ECA LNG Phase 2 project dependent in part on whether the investment in a large-scale liquefaction export facility would, over the long term, be more beneficial than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts.\nIn connection with certain of these LNG export development opportunities, we have entered into or may enter into Heads of Agreements, Interim Project Participation Agreements, MOUs and/or similar arrangements, all of which are or will be nonbinding and do not or will not obligate any of the parties to execute any definitive agreements or participate in any such opportunities. Any decisions by Sempra Energy or our potential counterparties to proceed with a final investment decision (except with respect to the ECA LNG Phase 1 project, for which a final investment decision has been reached) or binding agreements with respect to our proposed liquefaction export projects will require, among other things, obtaining or maintaining binding customer commitments to purchase LNG, completion of project assessments and achieving other necessary internal and external approvals of each party. In addition, all our proposed LNG export projects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the receipt and maintenance of a number of permits and approvals; finding or maintaining suitable partners and customers; obtaining or maintaining financing and incentives; negotiating and completing or maintaining suitable commercial agreements, including equity acquisition and governance agreements, natural gas supply and transportation agreements, LNG sale and purchase agreements and construction contracts (including new EPC contracts for certain projects); and, except for ECA LNG Phase 1, reaching a final investment decision.\nThere is no assurance that our proposed LNG export facilities will be completed in accordance with estimated timelines and budgets or at all, and our inability to complete one or more of these facilities or significant delays or cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects, including the recoverability of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in these projects to date.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe may become involved in various financing arrangements with respect to any of our energy infrastructure projects, some of which could expose us to additional risks. For example, Sempra Energy has provided guarantees for its share of Cameron LNG JV\u2019s financing obligations related to its Phase 1 facility for a maximum amount of up to $4.0 billion, which terminate upon Cameron LNG JV achieving \u201cfinancial completion\u201d of the initial three-train liquefaction project, including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests. Although these performance tests are\ncurrently underway and we anticipate financial completion will be achieved and the guarantees will be terminated in the first half of 2021, this timing could be delayed, perhaps substantially, if these operational performance tests are not completed due to weather-related events, or other events or factors beyond our control. Any failure to achieve financial completion by September 30, 2021 (unless such date is extended in the event of force majeure) would result in an event of default under Cameron LNG JV\u2019s financing agreements and a potential demand on Sempra Energy\u2019s guarantees. Further, pursuant to the financing agreements, Cameron LNG JV is restricted from making distributions to its project owners, including Sempra LNG, from January 1, 2021 until the earlier of September 30, 2021 and the achievement of financial completion. A delay could materially adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows until financial completion is achieved.\nSempra Energy also has provided a separate guarantee with a maximum exposure to loss of $979 million under the Support Agreement for the benefit of CFIN in connection with a separate financing arrangement intended to return equity to the Cameron LNG JV project owners. This guarantee terminates upon full repayment of the guaranteed debt by 2039, and the holders of the guarantee are permitted to put the $753 million of guaranteed debt to Sempra Energy on an annual basis and upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including if the guaranteed debt is not paid in accordance with its terms, and may determine to transfer some or all of the guaranteed debt to Sempra Energy at certain specified times.\nThe loan and other financing agreements related to all of these guarantees contain events of default customary for such financings, and the occurrence of any such default could result in a demand on these guarantees. If we are required to pay some or all of the amounts under these guarantees (or, with respect to the guarantee under the Support Agreement, the guaranteed debt becomes a direct financial obligation as a result of any put or call), any such payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.\nDomestic and international hydraulic fracturing operations are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties that could increase the costs of doing business, impose additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect production of LNG and reduce or eliminate LNG export opportunities and demand.\nDomestic and international hydraulic fracturing operations face political and economic risks and other uncertainties. Several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations to impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition to state laws, some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, that may restrict the performance of or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. We cannot predict whether additional federal, state, local or international laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. The current U.S. Administration may have a negative view of hydraulic fracturing practices, which could increase the risk of regulation negatively affecting these operations. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations, natural gas prices in North America could rise, which in turn could materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas (based on Henry Hub pricing) and impact the supply of natural gas to Cameron LNG JV\u2019s Phase 1 project and our other LNG export projects currently in development. Increased regulation or difficulty in permitting of hydraulic fracturing, and any corresponding increase in domestic natural gas prices, could materially adversely affect demand for LNG exports and our ability to develop commercially viable LNG export facilities beyond Cameron LNG JV\u2019s Phase 1 facility currently in operation and ECA LNG Phase 1 currently in construction.\nWhen our businesses enter into fixed-price long-term contracts to provide services or commodities, they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks.\nSempra Mexico and Sempra LNG generally endeavor to secure long-term contracts with customers for services and commodities in an effort to optimize the use of their facilities, reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure. However, if these contracts are at fixed prices, the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures, including rising operational costs, costs of labor, materials, equipment and commodities, rising interest rates that affect financing costs and changes in applicable exchange rates. We may try to mitigate these risks by, among other things, using variable pricing tied to market indices, anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects, providing for cost escalation, providing for direct pass-through of operating costs or entering into hedges. However, these measures, if implemented, may not fully offset any increases in operating expenses and/or financing costs caused by inflationary pressures, and using these measures could introduce additional risks. The failure to fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.\nIncreased competition could materially adversely affect us.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom have extensive and diversified development and/or operating experience (including both domestically and internationally) and financial resources\nsimilar to or greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the natural gas pipeline, storage and LNG market segments have been characterized by strong and increasing competition both with respect to winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets. In Mexico, despite the commissioning of many new energy infrastructure projects by the CFE and other governmental agencies, competition for recent pipeline projects has been intense with numerous bidders competing aggressively for these projects. In addition, Sempra Mexico\u2019s natural gas distribution business faces increased competition now that its former exclusivity period with respect to its distribution zones has expired and other distributors are legally permitted to build and operate natural gas distribution systems and compete to attract customers in the locations where it operates. There is no assurance that we will be successful in bidding for new development opportunities in the U.S. or Mexico. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe may not be able to enter into, maintain, extend or replace expiring long-term supply and sales agreements or long-term firm capacity agreements for our projects.\nThe ECA Regas Facility has long-term capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties. Under these agreements, customers pay capacity reservation and usage fees to receive, store and regasify the customers\u2019 LNG. We also may enter into short-term and/or long-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified for sale to other parties. The long-term supply agreements are intended to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying LNG supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices. However, the long-term nature of these agreements also exposes us to risks, including increased credit risks that we discuss below under \u201cRisks Related to Our Businesses Other Than the California Utilities and Our Interest in Oncor - Operational Risks.\u201d In addition, in 2020, the two third-party capacity customers at the ECA Regas Facility, Shell Mexico and Gazprom, asserted a breach of contract by IEnova and a force majeure event, seeking to terminate these capacity agreements and recover damages. One of these two customers has stopped making payments under its long-term capacity agreement (and IEnova has drawn on the customer\u2019s letter of credit provided as payment security), has submitted a request for arbitration of the dispute and has filed a constitutional challenge related to the dispute, and although the other customer is presently making regular payments under its agreement, it has joined the arbitration proceedings related to the dispute. In addition, one of these customers has commenced legal proceedings in Mexican court seeking modification or rescission of certain material permits for the ECA Regas Facility and ECA LNG. An unfavorable decision with respect to all or any part of these challenges and proceedings, or the potential for an extended dispute, could lead to significant legal and other costs and could materially adversely affect our relationships with these long-term customers and the reliability of revenues from the ECA Regas Facility. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nFor certain of our potential liquefaction export projects, definitive sale and purchase agreements have been secured for some of the anticipated nameplate capacity of the applicable facility. These agreements contain conditions of effectiveness, including, for example, our final investment decision for the applicable project within agreed timelines. If these conditions are not satisfied or if these agreements cease to be effective for other reasons, we could be subject to significant competition in securing replacement customers for these projects and we may not be able to do so under favorable terms, in a timely manner or at all. Moreover, some of the anticipated capacity for these potential projects is not currently subject to definitive customer agreements, and we may not be able to identify suitable customers or negotiate satisfactory sale and purchase agreements for all or a portion of this anticipated capacity in a timely manner or at all. Any such outcome could jeopardize our ability to develop these potential projects and receive an acceptable return on our investments in the projects, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSempra Mexico\u2019s and Sempra LNG\u2019s ability to enter into or replace existing long-term firm capacity agreements for their natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from their transportation customers, which may include our LNG export facilities. A significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nThe electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive. As more plants are built, supplies of energy and related products exceed demand and competitive pressures increase, wholesale electricity prices may decline or become more volatile. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements, our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility, and we may be unable to sell the power that Sempra Mexico\u2019s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur businesses depend on the performance of counterparties, including with respect to long-term supply, sales and capacity agreements, and any failure by these parties to perform could result in substantial expenses and business\ndisruptions and exposure to commodity price risk and volatility, any of which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur businesses and the businesses we invest in depend on business partners, customers, suppliers and other counterparties who owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other long-term agreements or arrangements to perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements or arrangements. Should they fail to perform, we may be required to enter into alternative arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at then-current market prices. In such an event, we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties. Any efforts to enforce the terms of these agreements or arrangements through legal or other available means could involve significant time and costs and would be unpredictable and susceptible to failure. In addition, many such agreements and arrangements, including the relationships with the applicable counterparties, are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses. Further, we often extend credit to counterparties and customers and, although we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit, we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us. The failure of any of our counterparties to perform in accordance with their agreements or arrangements with us could materially adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.\nOur long-term supply, sales and firm capacity contracts increase our credit risk if our counterparties fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations. For example, if the counterparties, customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the ECA Regas Facility or Sempra Mexico\u2019s other long-term capacity agreements for the transportation of natural gas and LPG were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects. In addition, for Cameron LNG JV\u2019s Phase 1 project, Cameron LNG JV has 20-year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of TOTAL SE, Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. that collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the facility. If the counterparties to these tolling agreements were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations to Cameron LNG JV on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nCertain past assertions made by the CFE and Mexican government, coupled with past arbitration requests and other statements and actions by the CFE, raise serious concerns over whether the terms of Sempra Mexico\u2019s gas pipeline contracts will be honored or disputed in arbitration. The failure by the CFE or other customers to honor the terms of Sempra Mexico\u2019s gas pipeline contracts and the inability to enter into gas pipeline contracts in the future could have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nSempra Mexico\u2019s and Sempra LNG\u2019s obligations and those of their suppliers for LNG are contractually subject to suspension or termination for \u201cforce majeure\u201d events, which generally are beyond the control of the parties, and substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform, including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for any breach of the agreements, which in each case could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.\nSempra Mexico and Sempra LNG engage in JVs or invest in companies in which other equity partners may have or share with us control over the applicable project or investment. We discuss the risks related to these arrangements above under \u201cRisks Related to Our Businesses Other Than the California Utilities and Our Interest in Oncor - Operational Risks.\u201d\nWe rely on transportation assets and services, much of which we do not own or control, to deliver natural gas and electricity.\nWe depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and services owned and operated by third parties to, among other things:\n\u25aadeliver the natural gas and electricity and LPG we sell to wholesale markets or that we use for our natural gas liquefaction export facilities\n\u25aasupply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities\n\u25aaprovide retail energy services to customers\nSempra Mexico and Sempra LNG also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with the ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting, and also on specialized ships to transport LNG. Sempra Mexico\u2019s subsidiaries also rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers. If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities, electricity and other services to some or all of our customers. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity, natural gas, LNG or LPG supplies at then-current spot market rates, or we could lose customers that may be difficult to replace in competitive market conditions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nForeign Operations Risks\nOur international businesses and operations expose us to legal, tax, economic, geopolitical, management oversight, foreign currency and inflation risks and challenges.\nOverview\nIn Mexico, we own or have interests in natural gas distribution and transportation assets, LPG storage and transportation facilities, ethane transportation assets, electricity generation facilities, LNG facilities and ethane and liquid fuels marine and inland terminals. We also do business with companies based in foreign markets, including particularly our LNG export operations. Developing infrastructure projects, owning energy assets, operating businesses and contracting with companies in foreign jurisdictions subjects us to significant and complex management, security, political, legal, economic and financial risks that vary by country, many of which may differ from and potentially be greater than those associated with our wholly domestic businesses, including, among others:\n\u25aachanges in foreign laws and regulations, including tax, trade and environmental laws and regulations, and U.S. laws and regulations that are related to foreign operations or doing business internationally, including U.S. trade and related policies as we discuss below\n\u25aaactions by local regulatory bodies, including setting of rates and tariffs that may be earned by our businesses\n\u25aaadverse changes in economic or market conditions, limitations on ownership in foreign countries and inadequate enforcement of regulations\n\u25aarisks related to currency exchange and convertibility, including vulnerability to appreciation and depreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, as we discuss below\n\u25aapermitting and regulatory compliance\n\u25aaadverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals, challenges to or difficulty obtaining permits or approvals, difficulty enforcing contractual and property rights, differing legal standards for lawsuits or other proceedings, and unsettled property rights and titles in Mexico\n\u25aaenergy policy reform, including that which may result in adverse changes to and/or difficulty enforcing existing contracts or challenges completing and operating our renewable energy facilities in Mexico, as we discuss below\n\u25aaexpropriation or theft of assets\n\u25aaadverse changes in the stability of the governments or the economies in the countries in which we operate or do business\n\u25aaviolence, criminality, or social or political instability\n\u25aacompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws\n\u25aawith respect to our non-utility international business activities, changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, which may be driven by many of the factors listed above, among others\nMexican Government Influence on Economic and Energy Matters\nThe Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise, significant influence over the Mexican economy and energy landscape. Mexican governmental actions concerning the economy, energy laws and policies and certain governmental agencies, including the CFE, could have a significant impact on Mexican private sector entities in general and on IEnova\u2019s operations in particular. For example, the CFE and the Mexican government took certain actions in 2019 that raised serious concerns over whether the terms of Sempra Mexico\u2019s gas pipeline contracts would be honored or disputed in arbitration. IEnova and other affected natural gas pipeline developers joined the CFE and the President of Mexico\u2019s representatives in negotiations and were able to resolve the dispute, but we cannot predict whether similar disputes may arise and/or whether such disputes will be resolved on favorable terms to us, if at all. In addition, in 2020, certain Mexican governmental agencies issued orders and regulations that would reduce or limit the renewable energy sector\u2019s participation in the country\u2019s energy market. Although many of these measures have been stayed temporarily as a result of legal complaints filed with applicable Mexican courts, an unfavorable final decision on these complaints, or the potential for an extended dispute, could impact our ability to successfully complete construction of our facilities in Mexico, or to complete them in a timely manner and within expected budgets, may impact our ability to operate our facilities already in service in Mexico and may adversely affect our ability to develop new renewable energy projects in Mexico. Moreover, electricity prices in Mexico are currently subsidized by the Mexican federal government, which could place certain of IEnova\u2019s renewable energy projects at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, the President of Mexico presented on February 1, 2021 an initiative of amendment of the electrical industry law to include some public policies that are being challenged in court (such as establishing priority of dispatch for CFE plants over privately owned plants) and other threats to renewable energy. On February 3, 2021, Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court invalidated sections of the Policy for Reliability, Safety, Continuity and Quality of the National Electric System. We cannot predict the impact that the political, social, and judicial\nlandscape, including multiparty rule and trial resolutions, will have on the Mexican economy and our business in Mexico. Such circumstances may materially adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects in Mexico, which could have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy\u2019s consolidated financial statements. We discuss these matters further in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForeign Currency and Inflation\nWe have significant foreign operations in Mexico, which pose material foreign currency and inflation risks. Exchange and inflation rates with respect to the Mexican peso and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on our revenue, costs or cash flows from our international operations, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. Our Mexican subsidiary, IEnova, has U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities that give rise to Mexican currency exchange rate movements for Mexican income tax purposes. It also has significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are denominated in the Mexican peso and must be translated to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for Mexican inflation for Mexican income tax purposes. We may attempt to hedge material cross-currency transactions and earnings exposure through various means, including financial instruments and short-term investments, but these hedges may not successfully achieve our objectives of mitigating earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations. Because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries, we are susceptible to volatility in OCI caused by exchange rate fluctuations for entities whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. Moreover, Mexico has experienced periods of high inflation and exchange rate instability in the past, and severe devaluation of the Mexican peso could result in governmental intervention to institute restrictive exchange control policies, as has occurred before in Mexico and other Latin American countries. We discuss our foreign currency exposure at our Mexican subsidiaries in \u201cPart II - Item 7. MD&A\u201d and \u201cPart II - Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nU.S. Foreign Policy, including Trade and Related Matters\nAll our international business activities are sensitive to geo-political uncertainties and related factors, including U.S. foreign policy and the current U.S. position with respect to trade relations and related matters. The last U.S. Administration made substantial changes to or withdrew from trade agreements that affect our operations. For example, the USMCA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement as the principal trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, went into force in July 2020, and its long-term impact on our operations remains uncertain. With the current U.S. Administration having taken power in January 2021, the status of U.S. trade policy and U.S. involvement in international trade agreements going forward remains to be determined and could drastically shift in a manner that increases or mitigates adverse effects on our businesses. The last U.S. Administration also implemented changes to U.S. immigration policy and other policies that impact trade, including increasing tariffs, and the current U.S. Administration has taken steps to reverse some of these changes and could take other material action with respect to these matters. Such policy changes or other actions could adversely affect imports and exports between Mexico and the U.S. and negatively impact the U.S., Mexican and other economies and the companies with whom we conduct business, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nFinancial Risks\nOur businesses are exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in commodity prices, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks.\nWe buy energy-related commodities from time to time for LNG facilities or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers. The regional and other markets in which we purchase these commodities are competitive and can be subject to significant pricing volatility. Our revenues, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas, LNG, electricity or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we have not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions. Unanticipated changes in market prices for energy-related commodities can result from multiple factors, such as adverse weather conditions, change in supply and demand, availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, commodity production levels and storage capacity, energy and environmental regulations and legislation, and economic and financial market conditions, among other things.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits, and our properties in Mexico could be subject to expropriation by the Mexican government.\nWe are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the property in Mexico where our ECA Regas Facility is situated and our proposed ECA LNG liquefaction export projects are expected to be situated, as we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we may have or seek to obtain long-term leases or rights-of-way from governmental agencies or other third parties to operate our energy infrastructure located on land we do not own for a specific period of time. If we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties we own on which our current and proposed facilities are located, or if we are unable to obtain or retain rights to construct and operate our existing or proposed facilities on the properties we do not own on reasonable financial and other terms, we could lose our rights to occupy and use these properties and the related facilities, which could delay or derail proposed projects, increase our development costs, and result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts related to the affected facilities that could lead to legal costs, fines or penalties. In addition, disputes regarding any of these properties could make project financing and finding or maintaining suitable partners and customers difficult and could hinder or halt our ability to construct and, if completed, operate the affected facilities or proposed projects. If we are unable to occupy and use the properties and related facilities on which our existing or proposed infrastructure projects are located, it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nIn addition, IEnova\u2019s business and assets in energy generation, storage, transportation and distribution may be considered by the Mexican government to be a public service or essential for the provision of a public service, in which case these assets and the related business could be subject to expropriation or nationalization, loss of concessions, renegotiation or annulment of existing contracts, and other similar risks. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed IEnova Exchange Offer and Our Proposed Transaction Related to Sempra Infrastructure Partners\nOur ability to complete our proposed IEnova exchange offer is subject to various conditions and other risks and uncertainties that could cause the transaction to be abandoned, delayed or restructured, which could materially adversely affect us.\nIn December 2020, we announced our intention to launch a stock-for-stock exchange offer to acquire all outstanding publicly held shares of IEnova. The completion of this transaction is subject to governmental and regulatory consents, approvals and rulings, including from the SEC, CNBV and Mexican Stock Exchange, and other closing conditions. These and other governmental and regulatory authorities may not provide the consents, approvals and rulings that are needed to complete this transaction or could seek to block or challenge the transaction. In addition, other closing conditions to consummate the proposed transaction may not be satisfied. For example, the completion of the exchange offer is subject to the condition that the IEnova shares validly tendered and not withdrawn, together with all IEnova shares that we directly or indirectly own, represent no less than 95% of all of IEnova\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares, determined on the basis of all outstanding ordinary shares and on a fully diluted basis. Although we have the right to waive this condition, there is no assurance that we would do so, and we have no control over the level of participation in the exchange offer by IEnova\u2019s public shareholders. As a result, we may decide not to complete the exchange offer if this condition is not satisfied. If the required consents, approvals and rulings are not received or the other closing conditions are not satisfied or waived, or if any of the foregoing is not achieved in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, then the proposed exchange offer may be abandoned and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to complete the proposed exchange offer is subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties, many of which are not in our control, including, among others, if another party were to offer to acquire the publicly held shares of IEnova on terms that are more favorable than the terms we offer, as well as industry and market conditions. These risks and uncertainties could alter the proposed structure of the transaction or negatively affect our ability to complete the transaction in a timely manner or at all.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing risks individually or in combination could lead to the abandonment, delay or restructuring of the proposed exchange offer, in which case we would not be able to realize the potential benefits of the transaction but would still be required to pay the substantial costs incurred in connection with pursuing it, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects and the market value of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nThe proposed exchange offer, if completed, may not have the positive effects we anticipate, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nWe anticipate that the proposed exchange offer, if completed on the currently contemplated terms, will, over the long-term, have a positive impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. This expectation is based on current market conditions and is subject to a number of assumptions, estimates, projections and other uncertainties, including assumptions about the results of operations of IEnova after the proposed transaction and the costs to us to complete the transaction. If the transaction is completed, we may find that IEnova does not perform in accordance with our expectations for a number of reasons, including those we discuss above under \u201cRisks Related to Our Businesses Other Than the California Utilities and Our Interest in Oncor.\u201d In addition, we may fail to realize some or any of the benefits we expect from the transaction, we may incur material additional transaction costs, and we may be subject to other factors that cause our preliminary estimates to be incorrect. As a result, there is no assurance that the proposed exchange offer will positively impact our cash flows, results of operations, financial condition or other aspects of our performance, and it is possible that the transaction may have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects, any of which could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nWe expect to issue shares of our common stock in the proposed exchange offer, which would dilute the voting interests and could dilute the economic interests of our current shareholders and may adversely affect the market value of our common stock and preferred stock.\nIn the proposed transaction, we intend to offer to acquire up to 100% of the publicly held shares of IEnova in exchange for shares of our common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.0313 shares of our common stock for each one IEnova ordinary share, which exchange ratio remains subject to approval by the Sempra Energy board of directors. If all publicly held shares of IEnova are validly tendered into and not withdrawn from this exchange offer, and no IEnova shares are issued after February 22, 2021, then up to 13,560,497 shares of our common stock would be issued in the exchange offer. Although the exact number of shares of our common stock we may issue is uncertain and subject to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and we may in fact issue fewer shares than anticipated, the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock in this exchange offer would dilute the voting interests of our shareholders. In addition, the issuance of additional shares of our common stock without a commensurate increase in our consolidated earnings would decrease our EPS. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.\nThe proposed exchange offer, if completed, would subject us to additional regulation and liability in Mexico.\nIf we are able to complete the proposed exchange offer, we intend to list our common stock for trading on the Mexican Stock Exchange and register our common stock with the CNBV. Such listing and registration would subject us to additional filing and other requirements in Mexico that could involve significant costs and materially distract our personnel from their other responsibilities. In addition, if we become an issuer with stock registered in Mexico, the CNBV, as the Mexican securities market regulator, would have surveillance authority over Sempra Energy. This means that the CNBV would have the authority to make inspections of Sempra Energy\u2019s business, primarily in the form of requests for information and documents; impose fines or other penalties or sanctions for violations of Mexican securities laws and regulations; and seek criminal liability for actions conducted or with effects in Mexico. In addition, Sempra Energy\u2019s directors and officers would be subject to additional liability and trading restrictions with respect to their shares of Sempra Energy common stock under the securities laws and regulations in Mexico, which could make it more difficult to attract, recruit and retain qualified people for these positions. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.\nIn addition, although we intend to delist IEnova\u2019s shares from the Mexican Stock Exchange and cancel the registration of these shares with the CNBV if the proposed exchange offer is completed, such delisting and deregistration are subject to a number of requirements under applicable Mexican law and regulations, including the affirmative vote of no less than 95% of IEnova\u2019s ordinary shares at a shareholders\u2019 meeting held for that purpose. If we are not able to acquire sufficient shares in the exchange offer to satisfy this threshold, then we likely would not be able to obtain the votes necessary to effect such delisting and deregistration. In that case, both Sempra Energy and IEnova would be subject to regulation and liability as listed companies under Mexican securities laws after the exchange offer is completed, which would involve significant burdens on both companies that could negatively affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nOur proposed transaction related to Sempra Infrastructure Partners is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nIn December 2020, we announced our intention to sell NCI in Sempra Infrastructure Partners, which represents the combined businesses of Sempra LNG and IEnova. Our ability to complete this transaction is subject to a number of risks, including, among others, the ability to identify a suitable partner to purchase such NCI; negotiate the terms of equity sale, shareholder and other governance agreements with such partner; and obtain governmental, regulatory and third-party consents and approvals and satisfy any other closing conditions to complete this transaction. Although the structure and terms of this transaction remain to be\ndetermined, the governmental and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the transaction could seek to block or challenge it or could impose requirements or obligations as conditions to its approval. If any of these circumstances were to occur, or if we are not able to achieve all of the foregoing in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, then the proposed transaction may be abandoned and our prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nMoreover, even if we are able to complete this transaction, it may not result in the benefits we presently anticipate. Although we expect that this transaction could, over the long-term, have a positive impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition, this expectation is based on a number of assumptions, estimates, projections and other uncertainties about, among other things, the terms of the sale of NCI in Sempra Infrastructure Partners, the identity of the buyer of such NCI, the shareholder and other governance arrangements we make with such buyer, the costs to us to complete this transaction, the results of operations of Sempra LNG and IEnova after the proposed transaction, and other factors beyond our control. In light of the early stage of this proposed transaction, there are significant uncertainties regarding its ultimate impact on our businesses, and our current expectations about the potential benefits of this transaction could turn out to be wrong.\nThe proposed sale of NCI in Sempra Infrastructure Partners will reduce our ownership interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners. Any decrease in our ownership of Sempra Infrastructure Partners would also decrease our share of the cash flows, profits and other benefits these businesses currently or may in the future produce, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.", "PERMNO": 86136, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "SRE"}
