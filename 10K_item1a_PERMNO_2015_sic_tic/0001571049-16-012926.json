{"cik": "1358483", "company": "Everyday Health, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the information incorporated by reference herein. If any of the events described in the following risk factors occurs, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to incur losses in the future.\nWe have accumulated significant losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $130.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and, as a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve or sustain profitability. We may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.\nIf we are unable to provide content and services that attract users to Everyday Health properties on a consistent basis, our advertising and sponsorship revenues could be reduced.\nOur users, including consumers and healthcare professionals, have numerous other online and offline sources of health and wellness related information and product offerings. Our ability to compete for user traffic depends upon our ability to provide compelling and trusted health and wellness content, tools, mobile applications and other services that meet the needs of a variety of types of users. Our ability to do so depends, in turn, on:\n\u00b7 our ability to develop innovative tools and mobile applications, as well as implement new and updated features and services for existing tools and applications;\n\u00b7 our ability to hire and retain qualified authors, journalists and independent writers;\n\u00b7 our ability to license quality content from third parties; and\n\u00b7 our ability to monitor and respond to increases and decreases in user interest in specific topics.\nIf users do not perceive our content, mobile applications and tools to be useful, reliable and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their visits to our properties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop or acquire needed content, applications and tools at a reasonable cost or on a timely basis. The revenue opportunities generated from these efforts may fail to justify the amounts spent.\nIf we are unable to prove that our advertising and sponsorship solutions provide an attractive return on investment for our customers, our financial results could be harmed.\nWe derive a significant majority of our revenues from the sale of digital advertising and sponsorship solutions. Our ability to grow our advertising and sponsorship revenues will be dependent on our ability to demonstrate to marketers that their marketing campaigns with us provide a meaningful ROI relative to offline and other online opportunities. In fact, certain of our marketing campaigns are designed such that the revenues we receive are based entirely upon the ROI we deliver for our customers. We have invested significant resources in developing our research, analytics and campaign effectiveness capabilities and expect to continue to do so in the future. Our ability, however, to demonstrate the value of advertising and sponsorship on Everyday Health properties will depend, in part, on the sophistication of our analytics and measurement capabilities, the actions taken by our competitors to enhance their offerings, whether we meet the ROI expectations of our customers and a number of other factors. If we are unable to maintain sophisticated marketing and communications solutions that provide value to our customers or demonstrate our ability to provide value to our customers, our financial results will be harmed.\nOur failure to attract and retain users in a cost-effective manner could compromise our ability to grow our revenues and become profitable.\nOur continued success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain consumers and healthcare professionals in a cost-effective manner. In order to attract users to our properties, we must expend considerable amounts of money and resources for advertising and marketing. We use a diverse mix of marketing and advertising programs to promote our properties, and we have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant amounts of money on these initiatives. Significant increases in the pricing of one or more of these initiatives will result in higher marketing costs. Our failure to attract and acquire new, and retain existing, users in a cost-effective manner would make it more difficult to maintain and grow our revenues and ultimately to achieve profitability.\nIncreasingly, individuals are using mobile devices to access online content, applications and services and, if we fail to capture a significant share of this growing market opportunity or fail to generate revenues from it, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of consumers and healthcare professionals who access online content, applications and services through smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices has increased dramatically in the past few years. Accordingly, the portion of our page views from mobile devices has increased rapidly and is expected to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. To compete in this area, we must develop content, applications and tools for mobile devices that:\n\u00b7 users find engaging;\n\u00b7 work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks; and\n\u00b7 achieve a high level of market acceptance.\nIf we fail to capture a significant share of this increasingly important portion of the market, it could adversely affect our business. As mobile technology continues to evolve, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing and maintaining a robust mobile offering and we may need to devote additional resources to the creation, maintenance and support of our mobile offerings. Even if demand for our mobile applications continues to grow and we achieve a significant share of this market, we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve significant revenues or profits from these efforts. If we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our mobile offerings, our revenues and financial results may be negatively affected.\nOur advertising and sponsorship revenues are frequently derived from short-term contracts that may not be renewed.\nMany of our advertising and sponsorship contracts are short-term commitments and are subject to termination by the customer. Despite the short-term nature of these commitments, we typically expend significant resources over a lengthy sales cycle to obtain these contracts. Moreover, the time between the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor for a program and the delivery of our services may be longer than expected, especially for larger contracts, and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control. Our current customers may not fulfill their obligations under their existing contracts or continue to advertise with us beyond the terms of their existing contracts. If a significant number of our customers, or a few large customers, decide to reduce their expenditures with us or to discontinue advertising with us, we could experience a material decline in our revenues.\nOur advertising and sponsorship revenues are subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including the timing and amount of expenditures by our customers.\nAdvertising and sponsorship revenues comprise a significant majority of our revenues. Our advertising and sponsorship revenues accounted for approximately 90.1% and 90.3% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Advertising spending in the markets in which we compete can fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7 variations in expenditures by advertisers due to budgetary constraints;\n\u00b7 the cancellation, non-renewal or delay of campaigns;\n\u00b7 advertisers\u2019 internal review process;\n\u00b7 the cyclical and discretionary nature of advertising spending;\n\u00b7 the timing of FDA approvals of prescription drugs and medical devices;\n\u00b7 regulatory changes affecting advertising and promotion of prescription drugs and medical devices;\n\u00b7 seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that affect the promotion of specific products; and\n\u00b7 general economic conditions, including those specific to the Internet and media industries.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations, and these fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results. Our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7 traffic levels to our properties;\n\u00b7 our ability to introduce new and appealing content, applications and tools that will drive the growth of our user base;\n\u00b7 the spending priorities and advertising budget cycles of specific advertisers;\n\u00b7 the addition or loss of advertisers;\n\u00b7 the addition of new websites, mobile applications and services by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; and\n\u00b7 costs relating to our ongoing efforts to improve our content and advertising-based service offerings.\nIn addition, seasonal factors can also affect our operating results. For example, we have historically experienced an increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues in the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to the seasonal spend patterns of our customers.\nAs a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons are not reliable as indicators of our future performance. In addition, these fluctuations could result in volatility in our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows. As our business grows, these seasonal fluctuations may become more pronounced. Any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may differ from the expectations of securities analysts and investors. This could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur inability to sustain or grow our advertising rates, or our inability to manage the pace of change in the advertising technology industry, could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe rates charged for advertising on the Internet, including in the health sector, have fluctuated over the past few years due to a variety of factors, including the growth in use of search engines, the increase in the use of automated or programmatic advertising buying, growth of the mobile advertising market, general economic conditions and competitive offerings. We have committed significant resources to delivering content and advertising-based services designed to appeal to our customers by engaging users in a more interactive and personalized manner and seeking to provide a higher return on our customers\u2019 advertising expenditures. However, our customers may not perceive our content offerings and advertising-based services as sufficiently valuable to justify the payment of our rates. Moreover, given the inherent difficulties in delivering a rich advertisement on mobile channels, the increasing reliance of our customers on automated or programmatic advertising buying networks and the focus by advertisers on enforcing viewability requirements for their advertising impressions, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the prices that we seek for our advertising solutions. If we are unable to maintain our historical, or grow to anticipated, pricing levels for advertising, we will experience difficulties in maintaining or growing our revenues. As the advertising industry develops new concepts and technology to deliver and price advertising inventory, we may also incur additional costs to keep pace with these changes and to implement more effective products and services.\nA significant portion of the traffic to our properties is directed to us through algorithmic search results on Internet search engines and, if we are listed less prominently in search result listings, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nA significant portion of the traffic to our properties is directed to us through the algorithmic search results on Internet search engines such as Google. Algorithms are used by search engines to determine search result listings, and the order of such listings, displayed in response to specific searches. Accordingly, we seek to design our properties to deliver that content and tools in ways that will cause them to rank well in algorithmic search engine results, which makes it more likely that search engine users will visit our properties. This is commonly referred to as search engine optimization, or SEO. However, there can be no assurance that our SEO efforts will succeed in improving the ranking of our content or, even if they do result in such improvement, that the improved ranking will result in increased numbers of users and page views for our properties. In addition, search engines frequently change the criteria that determine website rankings in their search results, and our SEO efforts will not be successful if we do not respond to those changes appropriately and on a timely basis. Search engine providers may also prioritize search results generated by certain types of queries, including health queries, based on criteria they select or may otherwise intermediate in the search results generated, which could, in some circumstances, reduce the ranking that would otherwise be provided to our properties and increase the ranking of other properties. If we are unable to respond effectively to changes made by search engine providers in their algorithms and other processes, a substantial decrease in traffic to our properties could occur, which could cause our revenues to decrease and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur properties may also become listed less prominently in unpaid search results for other reasons, such as search engine technical difficulties, search engine technical changes and changes we make to our properties. In addition, search engines have deemed the practices of some companies to be inconsistent with search engine guidelines and have decided not to list their websites in search result listings at all. If listed less prominently or not at all in search result listings for any reason, the traffic to our properties would likely decline, which could harm our operating results. If we decide to attempt to replace this traffic, we may be required to increase our marketing expenditures, which could also harm our operating results.\nIf we are unsuccessful in generating revenues from health payers and providers, we may not be able to achieve our growth and business objectives.\nHistorically, we principally focused on providing health and wellness content to consumers and healthcare professionals and providing marketing solutions to our customers, consisting principally of pharmaceutical, consumer-packaged-goods, retail and over-the-counter product companies. However, an important component of our growth strategy involves leveraging our core assets to pursue adjacent opportunities across the broader health and wellness sector. In 2014, we created a healthcare solutions division that would leverage our existing core assets to offer health payers and providers various marketing and other products and services. In 2015, we acquired Tea Leaves Health, LLC, or Tea Leaves, a provider of a SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform for hospital systems to identify and engage consumers and physicians. However, our experience in developing new products and services for hospital systems, health insurance companies and other new potential customers is limited. Therefore, we may not achieve our revenue forecasts for our healthcare solutions business or we may encounter unanticipated issues in growing this business. Likewise, we may need to make additional investments in product development and sales and marketing in order to effectively grow this business. If we are unable to successfully integrate the Tea Leaves acquisition or develop new offerings or we are unable to successfully market our offerings to these new potential customers, we may not be able to achieve our growth and business objectives.\nFailure to maintain and enhance our brands could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe that our brand identity is critical to the success of our business and in maintaining our reputation as a trusted source of health and wellness information. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands are vital to expanding our user base and growing our relationships with advertisers. We believe that the importance of brand recognition and user loyalty will only increase in light of increasing competition in our markets. Some of our existing and potential competitors, including search engines, media companies and other online content providers, have well established brands with greater recognition and market penetration. We have expended considerable resources on establishing and enhancing the Everyday Health brand, as well as the brands of our other properties, such as MedPage Today, Cambridge BioMarketing and Tea Leaves. We have developed policies and procedures that are intended to preserve and enhance these brands, including editorial procedures designed to control the quality of our content. We expect to continue to devote significant additional resources and efforts to enhance our brands. However, we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance awareness of our brands, and events outside of our control may have a negative effect on our brands.\nThe decline in the popularity of our partners would adversely affect our ability to grow our business and revenues.\nWe depend on partnership arrangements under which we license content from third parties, including What to Expect. We believe that such content is an important element of our business and helps to differentiate us from our competitors. We have also entered into agreements with entities such as the Mayo Clinic to monetize their properties by selling advertising and sponsorships.\nWe rely on the popularity and credibility of these partners and they may not retain their current appeal or may become subject to negative publicity. The popularity and credibility of the properties associated with these partners also depend on the quality and acceptance of competing content released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative sources for the information, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. User preferences change frequently, and it is a challenge to anticipate what offerings will be successful at a certain point in time. Any decline in the popularity of the content offerings, or any negative publicity, whether individually or with respect to the content offerings associated with the properties associated with these partners, may have an adverse impact on our business and revenues.\nThe significant decline in our premium subscription-based business could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur premium services consist primarily of digital subscriptions sold to users who purchase access to one of our properties or to a specific interactive service or application, including www.Diet.MayoClinic.org. As our growth strategy has evolved to focus primarily on marketing and communications solutions rather than consumer subscription revenue, we have experienced a decline in our subscription revenues. In addition, our agreement regarding www.SouthBeachDiet.com recently expired and our agreement regarding www.JillianMichaels.com will expire in the second quarter of 2016. Therefore, we expect the decline in our total subscription revenues to continue. However, our subscription revenues may decline at a more rapid rate than anticipated, and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nFuture acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nSince our inception, we have acquired a number of complementary businesses, products and technologies. Most recently, in August 2015, we acquired Tea Leaves. We intend to continue to seek other complementary acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7 potential negative impact on our financial results because they may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or liabilities, may require us to amortize, write down or record impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, or may cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;\n\u00b7 difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired businesses and/or unexpected expenses in connection therewith;\n\u00b7 potential disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;\n\u00b7 potential loss of key personnel, customers or users from either our current business or an acquired company\u2019s business;\n\u00b7 unanticipated expenses relating to implementing or improving internal controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company of a business that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7 potential litigation resulting from our business combinations or acquisition activities; and\n\u00b7 potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses.\nOur inability to integrate any future acquired business successfully or the failure to achieve any expected synergies could result in increased expenses and a reduction in expected revenues or revenue growth. In addition, we may not be able to identify or consummate any future acquisition on favorable terms, or at all. If we do pursue an acquisition, it is possible that we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition or that the financial markets or investors will negatively view the acquisition. As a result, our stock price could fluctuate or decline.\nThe costs associated with potential acquisitions or strategic partnerships could dilute your investment or adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn order to finance acquisitions, investments or strategic partnerships, we may use equity securities, debt, cash or a combination of the foregoing. Any issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity may result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders, reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Any debt financing is likely to increase our interest expense and include financial and other covenants that could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, an acquisition may involve non-recurring charges, including write-downs of significant amounts of intangible assets or goodwill. The related increases in expenses could adversely affect our results of operations. Any such acquisitions or strategic alliances may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. We do not intend to seek security holder approval for any such acquisition or security issuance unless required by applicable law, regulation or the terms of our existing securities.\nOur growth could strain our personnel, technology and infrastructure resources. If we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\nOur growth in our business and operations, including the integration of a number of acquisitions, has placed a significant strain on our management, administrative, technological, operational and financial infrastructure. Anticipated future growth, including growth related to the broadening of our content offerings and marketing services and our expansion into new product offerings, will continue to place similar strains on our management, technology and infrastructure. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth. To manage the expected growth of our business and operations, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, technological and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. The resulting additional capital investments will increase our costs, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting cost reductions in the short term.\nWe face significant competition in attracting both users and customers.\nThe markets for healthcare marketing and communications solutions are intensely competitive, continually evolving and, in some cases, subject to rapid change. Our properties face competition from numerous other companies, both in attracting users and in generating revenue from marketers. We compete for users and marketers with the following:\n\u00b7 websites, mobile applications and other products and services that provide online health and wellness information directed at consumers and/or healthcare professionals, including both commercial websites and non-profit and governmental websites;\n\u00b7 general interest consumer websites or search engines that offer specialized health sub-channels or functions and other high-traffic websites that include both health-related and non-health-related content and services, including social media websites;\n\u00b7 advertising agencies that market digital products and services directly to customers;\n\u00b7 software solutions for hospital systems to engage with consumers and/or healthcare professionals;\n\u00b7 advertising technology companies that aggregate traffic from multiple websites or directly target consumers; and\n\u00b7 offline publications and information services.\nAs we continue to diversify the breadth of our content offerings and marketing services, we expect our competitors to further expand as well. Our current and future competitors may offer new categories of content, products or services before we do, which may give them a competitive advantage when trying to attract consumers or advertisers. Moreover, both existing and potential users may perceive our competitors\u2019 offerings to be superior to ours.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, we could lose market share to our competitors, and our revenues could decline.\nWe may not be able to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel in a cost-effective manner, which could impact the quality of our products and services and the effectiveness of our management, resulting in increased costs and lower revenues.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, hire and retain, at commercially reasonable rates, qualified editorial, sales and marketing, data sciences, customer support, technical, financial and accounting, legal and other managerial personnel. The competition for personnel in the industries in which we operate is intense and our personnel are often presented with compelling new opportunities. Our personnel may terminate their employment at any time for any reason, and in the recent past, a number of our talented personnel have terminated their employment with us to seek other opportunities. Loss of personnel may result in increased costs for replacement hiring and training. If we fail to attract and hire new personnel, or retain and motivate our current personnel, we may not be able to operate our businesses effectively, serve our users and customers properly or maintain the quality of our products and services.\nGiven the tenure and experience of our Chief Executive Officer, and his guiding role in developing our business and growth strategy since our inception, our growth may be inhibited, or our operations may be impaired, if we were to lose his services.\nOur growth and success depends to a significant extent on our ability to retain Benjamin Wolin, our Chief Executive Officer, who co-founded our company and has led the growth and management of our business since its inception. The loss of the services of Mr. Wolin could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively and to implement our business strategy. This may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline. Further, we cannot assure you that we would be able to successfully integrate a newly-hired chief executive officer with our existing management team.\nThere are a number of risks associated with expansion of our business internationally.\nAlthough currently our international operations are not material, expansion into international markets remains a potential opportunity to grow our business. In addition to facing many of the same challenges we face domestically, there are additional risks and costs inherent in expanding our business in international markets. These include:\n\u00b7 strong local competitors that are better attuned to the local culture and preferences;\n\u00b7 the need to adapt the content and advertising programs on our properties to meet local needs and to comply with local legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 limitations on our activities in foreign countries;\n\u00b7 more restrictive data protection regulation, which may vary by country;\n\u00b7 difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations;\n\u00b7 foreign political and economic uncertainty;\n\u00b7 currency exchange-rate fluctuations; and\n\u00b7 potential adverse tax requirements.\nWe have limited experience in managing international operations. As a result, we may face difficulties and unforeseen expenses in expanding our business internationally, and even if we attempt to do so, we may be unsuccessful.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology Platform\nIf our intellectual property and technologies are not adequately protected to prevent use or misappropriation by our competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies and intellectual property. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a combination of confidentiality and licensing agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, along with trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary technologies and intellectual property. These measures and agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information, including trade secrets, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We could potentially lose future intellectual property protection if any unauthorized disclosure of such information occurs.\nWe rely on our trademarks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our products and services from the products and services of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we may be forced to rebrand our products and services, which could result in a loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands.\nWe also possess intellectual property rights in aspects of our content, technology and software products. However, we do not register copyrights in our content or software. Copyrights of U.S. origin must be registered before the copyright owner may bring an infringement suit in the U.S. If one of our unregistered copyrights of U.S. origin is infringed by a third party, we will need to register the copyright before we can file an infringement suit in the U.S., and our remedies in any such infringement suit may be limited. Typically, our content is primarily protected by user agreements that limit access to and use of our content. Compliance with use restrictions is difficult to monitor, and our copyright rights may be more difficult to enforce than other forms of intellectual property rights.\nWe have applied for patent protection in the U.S. relating to certain products, processes and services. We may also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. We cannot assure you that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our technologies and intellectual property, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products or services, that our patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others or that the patents that we own will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage.\nThe legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving. If the protection of our technologies and intellectual property is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may diminish. In addition, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and litigation may be necessary to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. Any such litigation could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business. We also expect that the more successful we are, the more likely that competitors will claim that we infringe on their intellectual property or proprietary rights. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against these claims.\nOur ability to deliver personalized content, measure the performance of marketing campaigns and provide customer solutions depends on our ability to collect and use data, and any limitations on the collection and use of this data could significantly diminish the value of our solutions.\nOur ability to deliver personalized content, measure and optimize the performance of marketing campaigns and deliver solutions to our customers depends on our ability to utilize the data we collect directly from our users, data we collect from user engagement with our properties, data we receive from our customers and data we obtain from third parties. Our users voluntarily provide us with demographic and other information when they register for one of our websites or mobile applications. We also employ cookies and other personal identifiers to personalize content and advertising. Cookies are small files placed on an Internet user\u2019s computer that are used to collect information related to the user, such as the history of the user\u2019s interactions with our properties or third-party websites. In order to deliver marketing and communications solutions to pharmaceutical companies, health insurers and hospital systems, we rely on data provided by our customers. We also purchase data from third-party sources to augment our user profiles and marketing databases so we are better able to personalize content, enhance our analytical capabilities and better target our marketing programs.\nIf changes in user sentiment regarding the sharing of information results in a significant number of visitors to our websites and applications refusing to provide us with demographic information or information about their specific health interests, our ability to personalize content for our users and provide targeted marketing solutions would be impaired. If our users choose to opt-out of having their data used for behavioral targeting, it would be more difficult for us to offer targeted marketing programs to our customers. In addition, a material increase in the number of users who either opt out of accepting cookies or who use browsers, devices or applications that limit the use of cookies or other tracking technologies could negatively impact our ability to collect valuable data and provide marketing solutions to our customers. Likewise, if new laws or regulations limit the ability of our customers to share data with us or if our customers are unwilling to provide us data, our ability to provide marketing solutions and to develop new products will be impaired.\nWe append data from third-party sources to augment our user profiles. If we are unable to acquire data from third-party sources for whatever reason, or if there is a marked increase in the cost of obtaining such data, our ability to personalize content and provide marketing solutions could be negatively impacted.\nOur possession and use of personal information presents risks that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nOur operations are dependent in part on our ability, and that of our hosting providers, to maintain our computer and telecommunications systems in effective working order and to protect our systems against damage from fire, theft, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, hacker attacks, computer viruses and other events beyond our control. Maintaining our network security is of critical importance because we use and store confidential user, employee, customer and other sensitive data, such as names, addresses, credit card numbers and other personal information, including health claims data and information about a user\u2019s health interests.\nWe and our vendors use commercially available encryption technology when transmitting sensitive personal information over public networks. We also use security and business controls to limit access to, and use of, personal information. Third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business measures by developing and deploying viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that are designed to attack or infiltrate our systems and networks. In addition, employee error, malfeasance or other errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of registered user or employee privacy.\nIf third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our registered users or employees, we may be required to expend significant resources to resolve these problems. A major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including:\n\u00b7 possible fines, penalties and damages;\n\u00b7 customer and class action lawsuits;\n\u00b7 reduced demand for our content offerings and marketing and communications solutions;\n\u00b7 an unwillingness of customers to provide us their data;\n\u00b7 an unwillingness of users to provide us with their credit card or payment information;\n\u00b7 an unwillingness of registered users to provide us with personal information;\n\u00b7 breach of our customer agreements; and\n\u00b7 harm to our reputation and brand.\nFinally, privacy concerns in general may cause visitors to avoid online websites that collect information and may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our products and services. In addition, if our privacy practices are deemed unacceptable by watchdog groups or privacy advocates, such groups may attempt to block access to our properties or disparage our reputation and business.\nAs a creator and a distributor of content over the Internet, we face potential liability for legal claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we create or distribute.\nUsers access health-related content through our properties, including information regarding particular medical conditions, diagnosis and treatment and possible adverse reactions or side effects from medications. If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies, it is possible that consumers who rely on that content or others may make claims against us with various causes of action. Although our properties contain terms and conditions, including disclaimers of liability, that are intended to reduce or eliminate our liability, third parties may claim that these online agreements are unenforceable. The law governing the validity and enforceability of online agreements is still evolving and subject to uncertainty. A finding by a court that these agreements are invalid and that we are subject to liability could harm our business and require us to make costly changes to our properties and related content policies.\nOur editorial and other quality control procedures may not be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in our content offerings or to prevent such errors and omissions in content that is controlled by our partners. Even if potential claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations.\nIf we become subject to these types of claims and are not successful in our defense, we may be forced to pay substantial damages. Our insurance may not adequately protect us against these claims. The filing of these claims may result in negative publicity and also damage our reputation as a high quality and trusted provider of health and wellness content and services.\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, properties and advertising and marketing activities.\nFrom time to time, third parties may allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are forced to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, regardless of the merit or ultimate result of such claims, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, limitations on our ability to use our current properties or inability to market or provide our content offerings or advertising-based services. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to:\n\u00b7 develop new non-infringing technology;\n\u00b7 pay damages;\n\u00b7 enter into royalty or licensing agreements;\n\u00b7 cease providing certain content or advertising-based services; or\n\u00b7 take other actions to resolve the claims.\nThese actions, if required, may be costly, time-consuming or unavailable on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, many of our partnering agreements require us to indemnify our partners for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling in such an action.\nFurthermore, we face potential suits and liability for negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature of our content. These claims could potentially arise with respect to our technology and/or owned, licensed or user-provided content. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly, and any other liabilities we incur in connection with the claims could be significant.\nIn addition, we could be exposed to liability in connection with material posted to our properties and on social media websites by our employees and our users. Many of our properties offer consumers an opportunity to post comments and opinions and we may share such content on social media websites. Some of this user-provided content may infringe on third-party intellectual property rights or privacy rights or may otherwise be subject to challenge under copyright laws. Moreover, we could face claims for making such user-provided content available on our properties if users rely on such information to their detriment, particularly if the information relates to medical diagnosis and treatment. Such claims could divert management\u2019s time and attention away from our business and result in significant costs to us, regardless of the merit of these claims.\nIf we cannot protect our domain names, our ability to successfully promote our brands will be impaired.\nWe currently own various web domain names, including www.EverydayHealth.com and www.MedPageToday.com, that are critical to the operation of our business. The acquisition and maintenance of domain names, or Internet addresses, is generally regulated by governmental agencies and domain name registrars. The regulation of domain names in the U.S. and in foreign countries is subject to change. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to acquire or maintain the relevant domain names needed to conduct business. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. This failure could impair our ability to increase market share and revenues.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively deliver our services, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur business depends on the continuing operation of our technology infrastructure and systems. Any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our ability to deliver offerings quickly and accurately and/or process visitors\u2019 responses or customers\u2019 queries. Interruptions in our service could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our reputation if people believe our systems are unreliable. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist and/or cyber attacks, floods, fires, power loss, break-ins, security breaches, hardware or software failures, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems and similar events.\nWe rely on third-party vendors, including data centers and Internet bandwidth providers. Any disruption in the network access or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of these third-party providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could significantly harm our business. We may not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with our users and customers. In addition, system failures may result in loss of data, including customer data, user registration data, business intelligence data, content, and other data critical to the operation of our services, which could cause significant harm to our business and our reputation. Any financial or other difficulties our providers face may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which we cannot predict.\nAn increase in the usage of our properties and solutions could strain the capacity of our technology infrastructure. Any capacity constraints we experience could lead to slower response times or system failures and adversely affect the availability of properties and the level of usage, which could result in the loss of customers or revenue or harm to our business and results of operations.\nAny unscheduled interruption in our service would result in an immediate loss of revenue. Unscheduled interruptions in our software solutions could require us to provide credits and/or refunds to customers and result in the termination of customer contracts. Frequent or persistent system failures that result in the unavailability of any of our properties or slower response times could reduce the number of users accessing our properties, impair our delivery of advertisements and harm the perception of our properties as reliable, trustworthy and consistent sources of information. Our insurance policies provide only limited coverage for service interruptions and may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Industry\nLaws and standards relating to privacy and data collection and use could impair our efforts to maintain and grow our audience and customer base, thereby decreasing our revenues.\nWe collect information from users who register to access certain content on our properties, from our customers and from third-party sources of data. Subject to the ability of our users to decline, we may use this information to provide our users content and advertising that may be of interest to them. We may also share information about registered users with our customers. Internet user privacy and the use of our users\u2019 information to track online activities are issues that are subject to rigorous regulatory discussions and analysis both in the U.S. and abroad. We have privacy policies posted on our properties that we believe comply with laws applicable to us requiring notice about our information collection, use and disclosure practices. The U.S. federal and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution and use of personal information of Internet users. Several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and Canada, have adopted legislation, including directives or regulations, that may limit our collection and use of information from Internet users in these jurisdictions. Enforcement by regulators, including the FTC, requires us to provide consumers with notice, choice, security and access with respect to such information. The standards are subject to interpretation by courts and other governmental authorities. We cannot assure you that the privacy policies and other statements we provide to users of our properties, or our practices with respect to these matters, will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity in this area.\nOur software solutions depend on being able to receive data from our customers and third parties. A determination by a government agency, court or other governmental authority that any of our practices or the practices of our customers do not meet applicable standards or regulations, or the implementation of new standards or requirements, could result in liability and adversely affect our business. In addition, inquiries or proceedings involving foreign or U.S. data protection authorities may be expensive or time consuming, and their outcome is uncertain. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that our customers are currently in compliance, or will remain in compliance, with their own privacy policies, regulations governing consumer privacy or other applicable legal requirements.\nIn addition, growing public concern about privacy, data security and the collection, distribution and use of personal information has led to self-regulation of these practices by the Internet advertising and direct marketing industry. We participate in the DAA self-regulatory program under which we provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising. Ensuring compliance with these industry standards could negatively impact our revenues or result in increased costs. Failure to comply with current or new industry standards could create liability for us, damage our reputation and result in a loss of users and customers.\nWe also may be subject to COPPA, which applies to operators of commercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect personal information from children, and to operators of general audience websites with actual knowledge that they are collecting information from U.S. children under the age of 13. Our properties are not directed at children under the age of 13, and our registration process utilizes age screening in order to prevent under-age registrations. We believe that we are in compliance with COPPA. COPPA, however, is subject to interpretation by courts and other governmental authorities. The failure to accurately anticipate the application, interpretation or legislative expansion of this law could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.\nAdditionally, more burdensome laws or regulations, including consumer privacy and data security laws, could be enacted or applied to us or our customers. Such laws or regulations could impair our ability to collect user information that helps us to provide more targeted advertising to our users, thereby impairing our ability to maintain and grow our audience and maximize advertising and sponsorship revenues from our customers.\nWe face potential liability related to the privacy and security of health-related information we collect from, or on behalf of, our consumers and customers.\nThe privacy and security of information about the physical or mental health or condition of an individual is an area of significant focus in the U.S. because of heightened privacy concerns and the potential for significant consumer harm from the misuse of such sensitive data. We have procedures and technology in place intended to safeguard the information we receive from customers and users of our services from unauthorized access or use.\nThe Privacy Standards and Security Standards under HIPAA establish a set of basic national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. Notably, whereas HIPAA previously directly regulated only these covered entities, HITECH makes certain of HIPAA\u2019s Privacy and Security Standards directly applicable to covered entities\u2019 business associates. As a result, business associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable Privacy and Security Standards. Moreover, HITECH creates a new requirement to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information and imposes penalties on entities that fail to do so. The 2013 final HITECH omnibus rule modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that will likely make more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. Additionally, certain states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA.\nHIPAA directly applies to covered entities such as Tea Leaves\u2019 hospital clients. Since these clients disclose protected health information to Tea Leaves that it uses to provide certain services to them, Tea Leaves is a business associate of those clients. Certain of our other current or future products and services may involve the collection of individually identifiable health information for HIPAA covered entities. In addition, we may sign business associate agreements in connection with the provision of the products and services developed for other third parties.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA or HITECH or any of the applicable federal and state laws regarding patient privacy, identity theft prevention and detection, breach notification, and data security may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties or contractual liability under agreements with Tea Leaves\u2019 hospital clients. Any failure or perception of failure of our products or services to meet HIPAA, HITECH and related regulatory requirements could expose us to risks of investigation, notification, litigation, penalty, or enforcement, could adversely affect demand for our products and services, and force us to expend significant capital and other resources to modify our products or services to address the privacy and security requirements of our clients and HIPAA and HITECH. In addition, we are unable to predict what changes to the HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business. Any new legislation or regulation in the area of privacy and security of personal information, including personal health information, could also adversely affect our business operations.\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our advertising and sponsorship revenues is derived from the healthcare industry, including pharmaceutical, over-the-counter and consumer-packaged-goods companies, and could be affected by changes affecting healthcare spending. Likewise, our healthcare solutions business intends to further grow our product and service offerings to payers and providers. Industry changes affecting healthcare spending could impact the market for these offerings. General reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things:\n\u00b7 government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare industry participants interact with consumers and the general public;\n\u00b7 consolidation of healthcare industry participants;\n\u00b7 reductions in governmental funding for healthcare; and\n\u00b7 adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting pharmaceutical companies or other healthcare industry participants.\nEven if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market segments that we serve now or in the future. For example, use of our content offerings and the sale of our products and services could be affected by:\n\u00b7 changes in the design and provision of health insurance plans;\n\u00b7 a decrease in the number of new drugs or pharmaceutical products coming to market; and\n\u00b7 decreases in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical companies as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage or prohibit advertising or sponsorship activities by pharmaceutical companies.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with us.\nThe healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or, collectively, PPACA, seeks to reduce healthcare costs and decrease the number of uninsured legal U.S. residents by, among other things, requiring individuals to carry, and certain employers to offer, health insurance or be subject to penalties. PPACA also imposes various new regulations on health insurers, enhances remedies against fraud and abuse and contains provisions that will affect the revenues and profits of pharmaceutical and medical device companies, including new taxes on certain sales of their products. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nWe expect that significant changes to the healthcare industry will continue to occur. However, the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the demand for our offerings will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in the healthcare industry.\nGovernment regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Existing and future laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs and restrict our operations. Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application may not be clear. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or other failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could create liability for us. Even in areas where we are not subject to healthcare regulation directly, we may become involved in governmental actions or investigations through our relationships with customers that are regulated, and participation in such actions or investigations, even if we are not a party and not the subject of an investigation, may cause us to incur significant expenses.\nFor example, there are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships and inducements to healthcare providers and patients. The federal healthcare programs\u2019 anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from willingly offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward, or in return for either the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase or order of any item, good, facility or service covered by these programs. Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program. Our sale of advertising and sponsorships to healthcare providers implicates these laws. However, we review our practices to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws. The laws in this area are broad and we cannot determine precisely how the laws will be applied to our business practices. Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our practices violate any of these laws could subject us to liability and require us to change or terminate some portions of our business.\nFurther, we derive revenues from the sale of advertising and promotion of prescription and over-the-counter drugs. If the FDA or the FTC finds that any of the information provided on our properties violates FDA or FTC regulations, they may take regulatory or judicial action against us and/or the advertiser of that information. State attorneys general may also take similar action based on their state\u2019s consumer protection statutes. Any increase or change in regulation of advertising and promotion in the healthcare industry could make it more difficult for us to generate and grow our advertising and sponsorship revenues.\nIn addition, the practice of most healthcare professions requires licensing under applicable state law and state laws may further prohibit business entities from practicing medicine, which is referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. Similar state prohibitions may exist with respect to other licensed professions. We believe that we do not engage in the practice of medicine or any other licensed healthcare profession, or provide, through our properties, professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment or other advice that is tailored in such a way as to implicate state licensing or professional practice laws. However, a state may determine that some portion of our business violates these laws and may seek to have us discontinue those portions or subject us to penalties or licensure requirements. Any determination that we are a healthcare provider and acted improperly as a healthcare provider may result in liability to us.\nWe believe that none of our existing online services and mobile applications is subject to regulation as a medical device under applicable FDA regulations. However, it is possible that products and services that we may offer in the future could subject us to such regulation or that current rules could change or be interpreted to apply to some of our existing online services or mobile applications. Complying with such regulations could be burdensome and costly and could delay our introduction or new services or applications.\nChanges in regulations could hurt our business and financial results.\nIt is possible that new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations in the U.S. and elsewhere will be adopted covering issues affecting our business, including:\n\u00b7 privacy, data security and use of personally identifiable information;\n\u00b7 copyrights, trademarks and domain names; and\n\u00b7 marketing practices, such as e-mail or direct marketing.\nIncreased government regulation, or the application of existing laws to online activities, could:\n\u00b7 decrease the growth rate of the Internet;\n\u00b7 negatively impact our ability to generate revenues;\n\u00b7 increase our operating expenses; or\n\u00b7 expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to correspond with existing and potential consumers by e-mail.\nWe use e-mail as a significant means of communicating with our existing and potential consumers and healthcare professionals. The laws and regulations governing the use of e-mail for marketing purposes continue to evolve, and the growth and development of the market for commerce over the Internet may lead to the adoption of additional legislation or changes to existing laws. Such laws may impose additional restrictions on our ability to send e-mail to our users or potential users.\nNotably, the CAN-SPAM Act regulates commercial e-mails, provides a right on the part of the recipient to request the sender to stop sending messages, and establishes penalties for the sending of e-mail messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. An action alleging our failure to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act and the adverse publicity associated with any such action could result in less user participation and lead to reduced revenues from advertisers. If we were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, applicable state laws not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act, or foreign laws regulating the distribution of e-mail, whether as a result of violations by our partners or if we were deemed to be directly subject to and in violation of these requirements, we could be exposed to damages or penalties.\nIn addition to legal restrictions on the use of e-mail, Internet service providers and others typically attempt to block the transmission of unsolicited e-mail, commonly known as spam. If an Internet service provider or software program identifies e-mail from us as spam, we could be placed on a restricted list that would block our e-mail to consumers or potential consumers who maintain e-mail accounts with these Internet service providers or who use these software programs.\nFailure to provide online CME as part of our MedPage Today offering could adversely affect our professional business.\nPhysicians utilize www.MedPageToday.com to fulfill their continuing medical education, or CME, obligations. Our CME activities, which are conducted as part of our MedPage Today offering, are planned and implemented in accordance with the current Essential Areas and Elements and the Policies of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, or ACCME, which oversees providers of CME credit, and other applicable accreditation standards. We currently rely on Projects In Knowledge as our ACCME-accredited provider in connection with our CME offering. ACCME\u2019s standards for commercial support of CME are intended to assure, among other things, that CME activities of ACCME-accredited providers, such as Projects In Knowledge, are independent of \u201ccommercial interests,\u201d which are defined as entities that produce, market, re-sell or distribute healthcare goods and services, excluding certain organizations. \u201cCommercial interests,\u201d and entities owned or controlled by \u201ccommercial interests,\u201d are ineligible for accreditation by the ACCME.\nCME activities may be subject to government oversight or regulation by Congress, the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and state regulatory agencies. Educational activities, including CME, directed at physicians have been subject to increased governmental scrutiny to ensure that sponsors do not influence or control the content of the activities. In the event that these regulatory challenges inhibit our ability to provide CME, or if Projects In Knowledge, our ACCME-accredited partner, elects to terminate its relationship with us and we are unable to identify a suitable replacement partner, our ability to continue to attract physicians to www.MedPageToday.com may suffer.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Since our initial public offering, or IPO, in March 2014, our common stock has traded at prices as high as $19.89 per share and as low as $3.71 per share. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to the many risk factors listed in this section and other factors beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our key operating metrics, financial condition and operating results;\n\u00b7 issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 our announcement of actual results for a fiscal period that are higher or lower than projected or expected results, or our announcement of revenues or earnings guidance that is higher or lower than expected;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7 share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u00b7 sales or expected sales of additional common stock;\n\u00b7 announcements from, or operating results of, our competitors; or\n\u00b7 general economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may cause our common stock price to decline. As a result, you may lose some or all of your investment in our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal and disclosure controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements and other disclosures on a timely basis could be impaired.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Form 10-K for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS Act, we expect to avail ourselves of the exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require that we incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, or if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the New York Stock Exchange, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and not being required to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation or obtain stockholder approval of \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although, if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue, the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of any year, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period before the end of that five-year period, we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the December 31 following such occurrence. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions, in which case the price of our common stock may suffer or there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. In addition, the SEC has announced a multi-year plan that could ultimately lead to the use of International Financial Reporting Standards by U.S. issuers in their SEC filings. Any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of new equity securities, debt or a combination of both. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital requirements. If we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, existing stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest.\nWe have significant debt service obligations as a result of our outstanding long-term indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $111.1 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to our credit facility. Under the terms of this credit facility, as amended, we are required to make principal and interest payments on these borrowings through the maturity date of this facility in November 2019. As a result, we must use a significant portion of cash generated by our operations to satisfy our ongoing debt service obligations. Additionally, we will be required to repay, extend or refinance these borrowings when they become due, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so on reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to satisfy our obligations when they mature, our creditors could among other things, declare a default and accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their liens on substantially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCovenants in our credit facility restrict our operational flexibility.\nThe agreement governing our credit facility contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business, including the following:\n\u00b7 incurring additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7 making certain investments;\n\u00b7 disposing of assets;\n\u00b7 paying dividends and making other distributions to our stockholders;\n\u00b7 engaging in mergers and acquisitions; and\n\u00b7 granting liens on our assets.\nOur credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants could be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with any of the operational or financial covenants under our credit facility could result in a default, which could cause our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their liens on substantially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could deter takeover attempts.\nVarious provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay, prevent or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other attempt to acquire control of our company. Our stockholders might view any transaction of this type as being in their best interest since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the then-current market price for our common stock. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u00b7 authorize our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u00b7 divide our Board of Directors into three classes so that only approximately one-third of the total number of directors is elected each year;\n\u00b7 permit directors to be removed only for cause and then only by a two-thirds vote of our stockholders;\n\u00b7 prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7 prohibit action by written consent of our stockholders; and\n\u00b7 specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers and which has an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board of Directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock. A Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. However, we have not opted out of, and do not currently intend to opt out of, this provision.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. The forum selection clause in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that a substantial number of shares could be sold, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of March 4, 2016, we had approximately 32.9 million shares of our common stock outstanding. These shares are generally freely tradable, subject, in the case of sales by our affiliates, to the volume limitations and other provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. In addition, shares of our common stock subject to outstanding awards under our equity plans and upon exercise of an outstanding warrant, will generally become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain contractual limitations and/or applicable vesting conditions. Sales of common stock by existing stockholders in the public market, the availability of these shares for sale, our issuance of securities or the perception that any of these events might occur could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the sale of these securities could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional stock.\nIn addition, in the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely or cease coverage of our company, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend solely on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. In addition, the provisions of our credit facility prohibit us from paying cash dividends without first obtaining the consent of our lenders. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchase your shares.", "PERMNO": 14506, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "EVDY"}
