Risk Factors\nMany factors which affect our business and operations involve risks and uncertainties. The factors described below are some of the risks that could materially harm our business, financial conditions, results of operations or prospects.\nUnited States and global economic conditions could adversely affect us.\nThe United States and global economic conditions affect our results of operations and financial position. A significant part of our business relies on our customers\u2019 printing spend. A prolonged downturn in the global economy and an uncertain economic outlook could further reduce the demand for printed materials and related offerings that we provide our customers. Consequently, reductions or delays in our customers\u2019 spending could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We believe any extended economic uncertainty will impact our operating results.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and ability to service or refinance our debt, and prevent us from fulfilling our business obligations.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness, which requires significant principal and interest payments. Approximately $442.1 million of this indebtedness matures in the next 12 to18 months. As of our year ended 2015, our total indebtedness was approximately $1.2 billion, principally comprised of $148.2 million outstanding principal amount under the asset-based revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the ABL Facility; $540.0 million outstanding principal amount of 6.000% senior priority secured notes due 2019, which we refer to as the 6.000% Notes; $248.0 million outstanding principal amount of 8.500% junior priority secured notes due 2022, which we refer to as the 8.500% Notes; $199.7 million outstanding principal amount of 11.5% senior notes due 2017, which we refer to as the 11.5% Notes; and $83.3 million in outstanding principal amount of 7% senior exchangeable notes due 2017, which we refer to as the 7% Notes.\nWe are subject to the risks normally associated with near-maturity substantial indebtedness, including the risk that our cash flow revenues will be insufficient to meet our debt obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, and the risk that we may be unable to restructure or refinance all, or a portion of, our debt to avoid defaulting on our debt obligations or to meet other business needs. In addition, a refinancing of our existing indebtedness could result in higher interest rates, could require us to comply with more onerous covenants further restricting our business operations, or could be restricted by another one of our outstanding debt instruments. Our substantial level of indebtedness and the maturities thereof could also materially adversely affect our future operations, by, for example:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other business purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy all of our debt obligations, thereby increasing the risk of triggering a cross-default provision;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to economic downturns or other adverse developments relative to less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other corporate purposes in the future;\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing to satisfy business needs; or\n\u2022\nrequiring refinancing, the successful completion of which cannot be assured.\nOur ability to pay the principal of, or to reduce or refinance, our outstanding indebtedness depends on many factors.\nThe ABL Facility is scheduled to mature in February 2017, the 11.5% Notes and 7% Notes are scheduled to mature in May 2017, the 6.000% Notes are scheduled to mature in August 2019 and the 8.500% Notes are scheduled to mature in September 2022. We currently anticipate that, in order to timely pay the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness, of which approximately $442.1 million matures in the next 12 to 18 months, as scheduled or upon the occurrence of any event of default or in the event that our cash flows from operations are insufficient to allow us to pay the principal amount of our indebtedness at maturity, we may be required to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek to sell assets or operations, seek to sell additional debt securities or seek additional financing from third parties. We may be unable to take any of these actions due to a variety of general economic, financial, competitive, commercial or other market factors beyond our control or constraints in our debt instruments, including, but not limited to, market conditions being unfavorable for a debt issuance, additional financing not being available from third parties or that the transactions may not be permitted under the terms of the various debt instruments then in effect, such as due to restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, creation of liens and/or dispositions of assets. Such actions may not enable us to satisfy our cash requirements or enable us to comply with the financial covenants under our debt instruments\nif the actions do not result in sufficient savings or generate a sufficient amount of additional capital, as the case may be.\nThe future state of the credit markets, including any volatility and/or tightening of the credit markets and reduction in credit availability, could adversely impact our ability to restructure, refinance or replace our outstanding indebtedness at or prior to their respective maturity dates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nUnder the ABL Facility, we may elect to extend the maturity date of the ABL Facility to April 2018 if prior to January 14, 2017, we have purchased, redeemed, defeased or otherwise refinanced the 11.5% Notes, such that no more than $10.0 million of such 11.5% Notes remain outstanding. There can be no assurances that we may successfully achieve such purchase, redemption, defeasance or other refinancing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.\nThe terms of our indebtedness impose significant restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants which limit our ability (subject in each case to limited exceptions) to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments, including dividends and prepaying indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate or permit certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into business combinations and asset sale transactions;\n\u2022\nmake investments, including capital expenditures;\n\u2022\namend organizational documents and change accounting methods;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nenter into new businesses.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or incur needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities which may arise.\nThe ABL Facility also contains a negative covenant restricting dispositions, including dispositions the aggregate book value of which exceeds $35.0 million. Such dispositions are permitted, however, if within 360 days after the receipt of any net proceeds from such dispositions, we apply all of the net proceeds thereof: (i) to be reinvested in the business of the Company; (ii) to repay obligations under the ABL Facility under certain circumstances; or (iii) to make an offer to purchase the 6.000% Notes. Each of the indentures governing the 6.000% Notes, 8.500% Notes and 11.5% Notes also contains a negative covenant requiring us to apply any net proceeds from an asset sale: (i) to be reinvested in the business of the Company; (ii) to repay certain of our indebtedness; or (iii) to make an offer to purchase the 6.000% Notes, 8.500% Notes or 11.5% Notes, respectively. On January 19, 2016, we completed the sale of our Packaging Business, realizing total cash proceeds of approximately $86.6 million, net of transaction costs. As a result, by January 13, 2017 we must apply such net proceeds as described above. Our failure to do so would result in a default under the ABL Facility and each of the indentures governing the 6.000% Notes, 8.500% Notes and 11.5% Notes. Such a default could cause the indebtedness outstanding under the ABL Facility and each of the 6.000% Notes, 8.500% Notes and 11.5% Notes, and, by reason of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, the 7% Notes, and any other indebtedness we may then have, to become immediately due and payable for which we would not have sufficient resources to satisfy.\nIn addition, the ABL Facility contains a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio with which, under certain circumstances, we must comply on a quarterly basis. Our ability to meet such fixed charge coverage ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, such as further deterioration in general economic conditions. We are also required to provide certain financial information on a quarterly basis. Our failure to maintain the fixed charge coverage ratio or effective internal controls could, in certain circumstances, prevent us from borrowing additional amounts, and could result in a default under the ABL Facility. Such a default could cause the indebtedness outstanding under the ABL Facility, and, by reason of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, the 6.000% Notes, the 8.500% Notes, the 11.5% Notes and the 7% Notes, and any other indebtedness we may then have, to become immediately due and payable for which we would not have sufficient resources to satisfy.\nIf any such defaults occur and if we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the ABL Facility and indentures governing the 6.000% Notes and 8.500% Notes could initiate a bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, or proceed against the collateral granted to them which secures that indebtedness. If the lenders under the ABL Facility and/or indentures governing the 6.000% Notes and/or 8.500% Notes were to accelerate the repayment of outstanding borrowings, we would not have sufficient resources to repay our indebtedness.\nThere are additional borrowings available to us which could further exacerbate our risk exposure from debt.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our junior priority secured notes indenture, senior priority secured notes indenture, senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, senior notes indenture and our other debt instruments limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt. If we incur additional debt above our current outstanding levels, the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase.\nWe have received notices from the New York Stock Exchange, which we refer to as the NYSE, that we did not meet its continued listing requirements. If we cannot meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, the NYSE may delist our common shares, which would have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common shares.\nOn January 19, 2016, we received notice from the NYSE that we do not satisfy the NYSE\u2019s continued listing standard requiring the average closing price of the our common stock to be at least $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days. The notice has had no immediate impact on the listing of our common stock. We have 180 days from the date of the notice to regain compliance with the NYSE\u2019s $1.00 minimum share price requirement. We can regain compliance at any time during the six-month cure period if on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period our common shares have a closing share price of at least $1.00 and an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of such month. Additionally on February 11, 2016, we received a notice from the NYSE that we do not satisfy the NYSE\u2019s continued listing standard requirement that our average global market capitalization be at least $50.0 million for 30 consecutive trading days. Although, as with the initial notice, this notice also has no immediate impact on the listing of our common stock, for this second notice we have 180 days to regain compliance with the NYSE\u2019s minimum average global market capitalization requirement. If we are unable to maintain compliance with the NYSE listing requirements, our common stock will be delisted from the NYSE. As a result of such a delisting, we would likely have our common stock quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or over the counter, in order to have our common stock continue to be traded on a public market. Securities that trade over the counter generally have less liquidity and greater volatility than securities that trade on the NYSE. Delisting from the NYSE may also preclude us from using certain state securities law exemptions, which could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise capital in the future and more difficult for us to provide compensation packages sufficient to attract and retain key employees. In addition, because issuers whose securities trade over the counter are not subject to the corporate governance and other standards imposed by the NYSE, our reputation may suffer, which could result in a decrease in the trading price of our shares. The delisting of our common stock from the NYSE would significantly disrupt the ability of investors to trade our common stock and could materially and adversely affect the value and liquidity of our securities.\nTo the extent we make select acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our business.\nIn the past, we have grown rapidly through acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue select acquisition opportunities within our core and niche businesses. To the extent we seek to pursue additional acquisitions, we cannot be certain target businesses will be available on favorable terms or that, if we are able to acquire businesses on favorable terms, we will be able to successfully integrate or profitably manage them. Successfully integrating an acquisition involves minimizing disruptions and efficiently managing substantial changes, some of which may be beyond our control. An acquisition always carries the risk that such changes, including facility and equipment location, management and employee base, policies, philosophies and procedures, could have unanticipated effects, could require more resources than intended and could cause customers to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers. A failure to realize acquisition synergies and savings could negatively impact the results of both our acquired and existing operations.\nA decline in our consolidated profitability or profitability within one of our individual reporting units could result in the impairment of assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets.\nWe have material amounts of goodwill and other long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheet. A decline in expected profitability, particularly the impact of an extended uncertainty in the United States and global economies, could call into question the recoverability of our related goodwill and other long-lived assets and require us to write down or write-off these assets.\nThe industries in which we operate our business are highly competitive and extremely fragmented.\nThe industries in which we compete are highly competitive and extremely fragmented. In the envelope market, we compete primarily with a few multi-plant and many single-plant companies servicing regional and local markets. In the commercial printing market, we compete against a few large, diversified and financially stronger printing companies, as well as smaller regional and local commercial printers, many of which are capable of competing with us on volume, price and production quality. We believe there currently is excess capacity in the industries in which we operate, which has resulted in substantial price competition which may continue as customers put product work out for competitive bid. We are constantly seeking ways to reduce our costs, become more efficient and attract customers. We cannot, however, be certain these efforts will be successful or our competitors will not be more successful in their similar efforts. If we fail to reduce costs and increase productivity, or to meet customer demand for new value-added products, services or technologies, we may face decreased revenues and profit margins in markets where we encounter price competition, which in turn could reduce our cash flow and profitability.\nThe printing business we compete in generally does not have long-term customer agreements, and our printing operations may be subject to quarterly and cyclical fluctuations.\nThe printing industry in which we compete is generally characterized by individual orders from customers or short-term contracts. A significant portion of our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase products or services from us. Most customer orders are for specific printing jobs, and repeat business largely depends on our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our work product. Although our business does not depend on any one customer or group of customers, we cannot be sure that any particular customer will continue to do business with us for any period of time. In addition, the timing of particular jobs or types of jobs at particular times of year may cause significant fluctuations in the operating results of our operations in any given quarter. We depend to some extent on sales to certain industries, such as the financial services, advertising, pharmaceutical, automotive and office products industries. To the extent these industries experience downturns, the results of our operations may be adversely affected.\nFactors affecting the United States Postal Service can impact demand for our products.\nPostal costs are a significant component of many of our customers\u2019 cost structure. Historically, increases in postal rates have resulted in reductions in the volume of mail sent, including direct mail, which is a meaningful portion of our envelope volume. As postal rate increases in the United States are outside our control, we can provide no assurance that any future increases in United States postal rates will not have a negative effect on the level of mail sent or the volume of envelopes purchased.\nFactors other than postal rates which affect the volume of mail sent through the United States postal system may also negatively affect our business. Congress enacted a federal \"Do Not Call\" registry in response to consumer backlash against telemarketers and is contemplating enacting so-called \"anti-spam\" legislation in response to consumer complaints about unsolicited e-mail advertisements. If similar legislation becomes enacted for direct mail advertisers, our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, the United States Postal Service has also indicated the potential need to reduce delivery days from six to five. We can provide no assurance that such a change would not impact our customers\u2019 decisions to use direct mail products, which may in turn cause a decrease in our revenues and profitability; however, we do not expect such an impact.\nThe availability of the internet and other electronic media may adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the demand for envelopes sent through the mail. Such demand comes from utility companies, banks and other financial institutions, among other companies. Our printing business also depends upon demand for printed advertising among other products. Consumers increasingly use the internet and other electronic media to purchase goods and services, and for other purposes, such as paying bills and obtaining electronic versions of printed product. The level of acceptance of electronic media by consumers as well as the extent that consumers are replacing traditional printed reading materials with internet hosted media content or e-reading devices is difficult to predict. Advertisers use the internet and other electronic media for targeted campaigns directed at specific electronic user groups. We cannot be certain the acceleration of the trend towards electronic media will not cause a decrease in the demand for our products. If demand for our products decreases, our cash flow or profitability could materially decrease.\nIncreases in paper costs and any decreases in the availability of our raw materials could have a material effect on our business.\nPaper costs represent a significant portion of our cost of materials. Changes in paper pricing generally do not affect the operating margins of our commercial printing business, because the transactional nature of the business allows us to pass on most announced increases in paper prices to our customers. However, our ability to pass on increases in paper prices is dependent upon the competitive environment at any given time. Paper pricing also affects the operating margins of our envelope business. We have historically been less successful in immediately passing on such paper price increases due to several factors, including contractual restrictions in certain cases and the inability to quickly update catalog prices in other instances. Moreover, rising paper costs, and their consequent impact on our pricing, could lead to a decrease in demand for our products.\nWe depend on the availability of paper in manufacturing most of our products. During periods of tight paper supply, many paper producers allocate shipments of paper based on the historical purchase levels of customers. In the past, we have occasionally experienced minor delays in delivery. Any future delay in availability could negatively impact our cash flow and profitability.\nWe depend on good labor relations.\nAs of the end of January 2016, we employed approximately 7,300 people worldwide, approximately 23% of whom were members of various local labor unions. If our unionized employees were to engage in a concerted strike or other work stoppage, or if other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a disruption of operations, higher labor costs or both. A lengthy strike could result in a material decrease in our cash flow or profitability.\nEnvironmental laws may affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharge, waste generation, handling, management and disposal, and remediation of contaminated sites. Currently unknown environmental conditions or matters at our existing and prior facilities, new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations could result in increased compliance or remediation costs which, if substantial, could have a material effect on our business or operations in the future.\nWe are dependent on key management personnel.\nOur success will depend to a significant degree on our executive officers and other key management personnel. We cannot be certain we will be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel, or attract additional qualified management in the future. In addition, the success of any acquisitions we may pursue may depend, in part, on our ability to retain management personnel of the acquired companies. We do not carry key person insurance on any of our managerial personnel.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by any failure, interruption or security lapse of our information technology systems.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems to process transactions, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. We use information systems to support decision making and to monitor business performance. Our information technology systems depend on global communications providers, telephone systems, hardware, software and other aspects of internet infrastructure which can experience significant system failures and outages. Our systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems are vulnerable to computer viruses and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our systems. In addition, cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches which could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information technology systems and inhibit internal operations, the ability to provide customer service or provide management with accurate financial and operational information essential for making decisions at various levels of management.", "PERMNO": 82266, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "CVOVQ"}
