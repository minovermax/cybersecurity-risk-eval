{"cik": "1380846", "company": "TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. There are risks, many beyond our control, that could cause our financial condition or results of operations to differ materially from management\u2019s expectations. Some of the risks that may affect us are described below. If any of the following risks, singly or together with one or more other factors, actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. These risks are not the only risks that we may face. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the United States, as well as other risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Further, some statements contained herein constitute forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 4. The risks described below should also be considered together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the disclosures in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe may not be able to adequately measure and limit our credit risk, which could lead to unexpected losses.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk and maintaining disciplined and prudent underwriting standards. The business of lending is inherently risky, and includes the risk that the principal or interest on any loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting the loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. In addition, we are exposed to risks with respect to the period of time over which loans may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual loans and borrowers. The creditworthiness of a borrower is affected by many factors, including local market conditions and general economic conditions, and many of our loans are made to middle-market businesses that may be less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers.\nOur risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific industries and our credit approval, review and administrative practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of our loan portfolio, which may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs, and may require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan and lease losses (ALL), each of which could adversely affect our net income. In addition, the weakening of our underwriting standards for any reason, such as to seek higher yielding loans, or a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs or an increase in ALL, any of which could adversely affect our net income. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk and our underwriting standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb our loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur experience in the banking industry indicates that some portion of our loans will not be fully repaid in a timely manner or at all. Accordingly, we maintain an ALL that represents management\u2019s judgment of probable losses in our loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of historical losses in our portfolio and general economic conditions, among other factors. The determination of the ALL is inherently subjective and requires us to make significant assumptions which may change or be incorrect. Inaccurate assumptions, deterioration of economic conditions, new information, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our ALL. In addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their periodic examination, review the adequacy of our ALL and may direct us to make additions to it. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the ALL, we may need additional provision for loan losses to restore the adequacy of our ALL. While we believe that our ALL was adequate at December 31, 2019, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future loan losses, especially if there is a significant deterioration in economic conditions. If we are required to materially increase our level of ALL for any reason, such increase could materially decrease our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nA material portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans secured by general business assets, the deterioration in value of which could expose us to credit losses.\nHistorically, a material portion of our loans held-for-investment have been comprised of commercial loans to businesses collateralized by business assets including, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, cash value life insurance and owner-occupied real estate. These commercial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis. Additionally, the repayment of commercial loans is subject to the ongoing business operations of the\nborrower. The collateral securing such loans generally includes movable property, such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate, exposing us to increased credit risk. In addition, a portion of our customer base, may be exposed to volatile businesses or industries which are sensitive to commodity prices or market fluctuations, such as energy prices. Accordingly, negative changes in commodity prices, real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nHistorically, losses in our commercial credits have been higher than losses in other segments of our loan portfolio. Significant adverse changes in various industries could cause rapid declines in values and collectability resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose us to credit losses. An increase in specific reserves and charge-offs related to our commercial and industrial loan portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. As of December 31, 2019, we had commercial and industrial loans outstanding of $1.09 billion, or 16.5% of our loans held-for-investment, and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans outstanding of $210.7 million, or 3.2% of our loans held-for-investment.\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, and in the states in which we operate in particular.\nIf the overall economic climate in the U.S., generally, and our market areas, specifically, experiences material disruption, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of non-performing loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for loan losses.\nMany of our customers are commercial enterprises whose business and financial condition are sensitive to changes in the general economy of the United States. Our businesses and operations are, in turn, sensitive to these same general economic conditions. If the United States experiences a deterioration or other significant volatility in economic conditions our growth and profitability could be constrained. In addition, any future downgrade of the credit rating of the United States, failures to raise the U.S. statutory debt limit, or deterioration in the fiscal outlook of the United States federal government, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities that we may hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. In addition, any resulting decline in the financial markets could affect the value of marketable securities that serve as collateral for our loans and the ability of our customers to repay loans. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries, including uncertainty over the stability of the euro currency and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, as well as concerns regarding terrorism and potential hostilities with various countries, could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could negatively affect U.S. economic conditions. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and future prospects.\nOur commercial banking operations are concentrated in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio. As a result, our business is affected by changes in the economic conditions of those states and the regions of which they are a part. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets, and we are vulnerable to a downturn in the local economies in these areas. For example, low energy prices have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact the economies of Western Pennsylvania and Northeastern Ohio, two of our significant commercial banking markets, which have industries focused on shale gas exploration and shale gas production. Although we do not make loans to companies directly engaged in oil and gas production, adverse conditions that affect these market areas could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans, affect the value of collateral underlying loans, impact our ability to attract deposits and generally affect our business and financial condition. Because of our geographic concentration, we may be less able than other financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets.\nWeak economic conditions can be characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, lack of liquidity and depressed prices in the secondary market for loans, increased delinquencies on loans, real estate price declines, and lower commercial activity. All of these factors can be detrimental to the business and/or financial position of our customers and their ability to repay loans as well as the value of the collateral supporting our loans which could adversely impact demand for our credit products as well as our credit quality. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to credit risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties, as well as real estate construction and development loans. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding loans secured by non-owner-occupied commercial properties of $1.59 billion, or 24.1%, of our loans held-for-investment. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the secured property. These loans typically expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral due to a number of factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the difficulty of liquidating the collateral securing these loans and the relatively larger loan balances compared to single borrowers. In addition, the amount we may realize after a default is dependent\nupon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, environmental cleanup liabilities, assessments, interest rates, real estate tax rates, operating expenses of the mortgaged property, occupancy rates, zoning laws, regulatory rules, and natural disasters. Accordingly, charge-offs on non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with residential or consumer loan portfolios.\nAn unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio or if only a few of our largest borrowers become unable to repay their loan obligations, could result in us increasing our ALL, which would reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and future prospects.\nOur private banking business could be negatively impacted by a prolonged downturn in the securities markets.\nMarketable-securities-backed private banking loans represent a material portion of our business and are the fastest growing portion of our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding marketable-securities-backed private banking loans of $3.60 billion, or 54.7% of our loans held-for-investment. We expect to continue to increase the percentage of our loan portfolio represented by marketable-securities-backed private banking loans in the future. A sharp or prolonged decline in the value of the collateral that secures these loans could materially adversely affect the growth prospects and loan performance in this segment of our loan portfolio and, as a result, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nA downturn in the real estate market, especially in our primary markets, could result in losses and adversely affect our profitability.\nA material portion of our loans are secured by real estate as a primary component of collateral. The real estate collateral provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value. A general decline in real estate values, particularly in our primary markets, could impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon any foreclosure, which would likely require us to increase our ALL. In addition, we could be subject to costly environmental liabilities with respect to foreclosed properties. In the event of a default with respect to any of these loans, the amount we receive upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. If we are required to re-value the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our ALL, our profitability could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur lending limit may restrict our growth and prevent us from effectively implementing our business strategy.\nWe are limited in the amount we can loan to a single borrower by the amount of our capital. Generally, under current law, we may lend up to15.0% of our unimpaired capital and surplus to any one borrower. We have established an internal lending limit that is significantly lower than our legal lending limit and, based upon our current capital levels, the amount we may lend is significantly less than that of many of our competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our lending limit from doing business with us. We accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy may not always be available. If we are unable to compete effectively for loans, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe rely heavily on our executive management team and other key employees, and the loss of the services of any of these individuals could adversely impact our business and reputation.\nOur success depends in large part on the performance of our key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business plan may be lengthy. We currently do not have any employment or non-compete agreements with any of our executive officers or key employees other than certain non-solicitation and restrictive agreements from certain key employees in connection with our investment management business. We may not be successful in retaining our key employees, and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our markets, relationships, industry experience and the difficulty of finding qualified replacement personnel. If the services of any of our key personnel become unavailable for any reason, we may not be able to hire qualified persons on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur business has grown rapidly, and we may not be able to maintain our historical rate of growth.\nOur business has grown rapidly. Although rapid business growth can be a favorable business condition, financial institutions that grow rapidly can experience significant difficulties as a result of rapid growth. Successful growth in our banking business requires that we follow adequate loan underwriting standards, balance loan and deposit growth while managing interest rate risk and our net interest margin, maintain adequate capital at all times, produce investment performance results competitive with our peers and benchmarks, further diversify our revenue sources, meet the expectations of our clients, and hire and retain qualified employees.\nWe may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or continue to grow our business at all. Because of factors such as the uncertainty in the general economy and the recent government intervention in the credit markets, it may be difficult for us to repeat our historic earnings growth as we continue to expand. Failure to grow or failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects, and could adversely affect the implementation our business strategy.\nOur utilization of brokered deposits could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nSince our inception, we have utilized both brokered and non-brokered deposits as a source of funds to support our growing loan demand and other liquidity needs. As a bank regulatory supervisory matter, reliance upon brokered deposits as a significant source of funding is discouraged. Brokered deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits and, in the future, those depositors may not renew their deposits, or we may have to pay a higher interest rate to keep those deposits or replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources. Additionally, if TriState Capital Bank ceases to be categorized as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes, it will not be able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits without a waiver from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. Our inability to maintain or replace these brokered deposits as they mature could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Further, paying higher interest rates to maintain or replace these deposits could adversely affect our net interest margin, our net income, and financial condition.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy will depend on our liquidity and ability to obtain funding for loan originations, working capital and other general purposes. Our preferred source of funds for our banking business consists of customer deposits; however, we rely on other sources such as brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank or \u201cFHLB\u201d advances. In addition to our competition with other banks for deposits, such account and deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return trade off. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we may increase our utilization of brokered deposits, FHLB advances and other wholesale funding sources necessary to fund desired growth levels.\nWe rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities and other sources of liquidity, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our banking operations. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to fund new loan balances, invest in securities, meet our expenses or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, we may not be able to maintain regulatory compliance.\nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, which could include the financing of acquisitions. In addition, we, on a consolidated basis, and Tristate Capital Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity required by regulators. Regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels or our regulators could ask us to maintain capital levels that are in excess of such requirements, which could require us to raise additional capital or reduce our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, as well as on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, we could be subject to enforcement actions or other regulatory consequences, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nAny future reductions in our credit ratings may increase our funding costs or impair our ability to effectively compete for business.\nCredit ratings or changes in ratings policies and practices are subject to change at any time, and it is possible that any rating agency will take action to downgrade us in the future. We have used and may in the future use debt as a funding source. One or more rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long-term debt are based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix and level and quality of earnings, and we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings.\nAny future decrease in our credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could impact our access to the capital markets or short-term funding or increase our financing costs, and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In the event of a ratings downgrade, our clients and counterparties may terminate their relationships with us, be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or only engage in transactions with us on terms that are less favorable. We cannot predict whether client relationships or opportunities for\nfuture relationships could be adversely affected by clients who choose to do business with a higher-rated institution. The inability to maintain our credit ratings have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact the profitability of our banking business.\nOur profitability depends to a significant extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by changes in market interest rates because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of our assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore net income, could be adversely affected.\nOur loans are predominantly variable rate loans, with the majority being based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. A decline in interest rates could cause the spread between our loan yields and our deposit rates paid to compress our net interest margin and our net income could be adversely affected. Further, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nIn addition, an increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the market value of our investment securities and the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also necessitate increases to our ALL. Each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nThe phasing out and ultimate replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate and changes in the manner of calculating other reference rates may adversely impact the value of loans and other financial instruments we hold that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates in ways that are difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial condition.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021, and for LIBOR to be replaced with an alternative reference rate that will be calculated in a different manner. The Company\u2019s commercial and consumer businesses issue, trade and hold various products that are currently indexed to LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a material amount of loans, investment securities, FHLB advances and notional value of derivatives indexed to LIBOR that will mature after 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based instruments or arrangements. One of the major identified risks is inadequate fallback language in the various instruments\u2019 contracts that may result in issues establishing the alternative index and adjusting the margin as applicable. The Company has (1) established a cross-functional team to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the transition of LIBOR and other benchmark rates; (2) developed an inventory of affected products; and (3) implemented fallback contractual language where no fallback language previously existed and developed a plan to assess the appropriateness of existing fallback contractual language in legacy loans.\nUncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities. If not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks to financial markets and institutions, including to the Company. In addition, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur investment management business may be negatively impacted by competition, changes in economic and market conditions, changes in interest rates and investment performance.\nA material portion of our earnings is derived from Chartwell, our investment management business. Chartwell may be negatively impacted by competition, changes in economic and market conditions, changes in interest rates and investment performance. The investment management business is intensely competitive. There are over 1,000 firms which we consider to be primary competitors. In addition to competition from other institutional investment management firms, Chartwell competes with passive index funds, ETFs and investment alternatives such as hedge funds. Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by Chartwell and its performance of competitors\u2019 products could lead to a loss of investment in similar Chartwell products, regardless of the performance of such products.\nOur investment management contracts are typically terminable in nature and our ability to successfully attract and retain investment management clients will depend on, among other things, our ability to compete with our competitors\u2019 investment products, our investment performance, fees, client services, marketing and distribution capabilities. Most of our clients may withdraw funds from under our management at their discretion at any time for any reason, including as a result of competition or poor performance of our products. If we cannot effectively attract and retain customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, it is possible our management fees could be reduced for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, pressure resulting from competition or regulatory changes, and we may from time to time reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services offered for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, to help retain or increase managed assets or for other reasons. If our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income from our investment management business would be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe cannot guaranty that our investment performance will be favorable in the future. The financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry are highly volatile and affected by, among other factors, economic conditions and trends in business, all of which are beyond our control. Declines in the financial markets, changes in interest rates or a lack of sustained growth may result in declines in the performance of our investment management business and the assets under management. Because the revenues of our investment management business are, to a large extent, fees based on assets under management, such declines could adversely affect our business.\nWe face significant competitive pressures that could impair our growth, decrease our profitability or reduce our market share.\nWe operate in the highly competitive financial services industry and face significant competition for customers from bank and non-bank competitors, particularly regional and nationwide institutions, in originating loans, attracting deposits, providing financial management products and services, and providing other financial services. Our competitors are generally larger and may have significantly more resources, greater name recognition, and more extensive and established branch networks or geographic footprints. Because of their scale, many of these competitors can be more aggressive than we can on loan, deposit and financial services pricing. In addition, many of our non-bank and non-institutional financial management competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. We expect competition to continue to intensify due to financial institution consolidation; legislative, regulatory and technological changes; and the emergence of alternative banking sources and investment management products and services. Additionally, technology has lowered barriers to entry.\nOur ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including, our ability to build and maintain long-term customer relationships while ensuring high ethical standards and safe and sound business practices; the scope, relevance, performance and pricing of products and services that we offer; customer satisfaction with our products and services; industry and general economic trends; and our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology. Increased competition could require us to increase the rates we pay on deposits or lower the rates we offer on loans or the fees we charge on banking or investment management products and services, all of which could reduce our profitability. Our failure to compete effectively in our primary markets could cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business.\nOur business plan emphasizes building and maintaining strong relationships with our clients. We have benefited from strong relationships with and among our customers, and also from our relationships with financial intermediaries. As a result, our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our existing relationships may be damaged. We could lose some of our existing customers, including groups of large customers who have relationships with each other, and we may not be successful in attracting new customers from competing financial institutions. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect to the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary often requires complex, subjective judgments about whether there has been a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer, whether management has the intent or ability to hold a\nsecurity for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security, and other relevant factors which may be inaccurate.\nOur financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP and with general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that have a possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.\nFor example, the Bank adopted new guidance for estimating credit losses on loans receivable, held-to-maturity debt securities, and unfunded loan commitments effective January 1, 2020. The current expected credit losses, or CECL, model significantly changed how entities recognize impairment of many financial assets by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses that occur over the life of the financial asset. This requires reserves over the life of the loan rather than the loss emergence period used in the prior model. The CECL guidance requires the implementation of new modeling to quantify this estimate by using principles of not only relevant historical experience and current conditions, but also reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and circumstances, thus incorporating a broad range of estimates and assumptions in developing credit loss estimates, which could result in significant changes to both the timing and amount of credit loss expense and allowance. Adoption of, and efforts to implement this guidance has caused and may cause our ALL to change materially in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Our company has very limited loss experience over its life. As a result, our implementation of CECL involved using general industry loss data to estimate historic loss experience. The availability and quality of relevant historical information under this estimation process, the accuracy of forecasts that are required under the CECL methodology, and the development of effective modeling to implement the CECL methodology can have material impacts on current and future provision reserve requirements.\nBy engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to additional credit and market risk in our banking business.\nWe use interest rate swaps to help manage our interest rate risk in our banking business from recorded financial assets and liabilities when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated asset or liability and the asset or liability exposes us to interest rate risk or risks inherent in customer related derivatives. We use other derivative financial instruments to help manage other economic risks, such as liquidity and credit risk and differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash receipts principally related to certain of our fixed-rate loan assets or certain of our variable-rate borrowings. We also have derivatives that result from a service we provide to certain qualifying customers approved through our credit process.\nBy engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk. Hedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and routine monitoring, and is not a perfect science. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivative instruments. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk exists to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. Market risk exists to the extent that interest rates change in ways that are significantly different from what we expected when we entered into the derivative transaction. The existence of credit and market risk associated with our derivative instruments could adversely affect our net interest income and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe may be adversely affected by a decrease in the soundness of other financial services companies.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services companies. The financial services industry is highly interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, servicing, custody arrangements, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, including through transactions with counterparties and intermediaries in the financial services industry such as brokers and dealers, commercial banks, insurance companies, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. In addition, we participate in loans originated by other financial institutions (including shared national credits) and our private banking channel relies on relationships with other financial services companies for referrals. As a result, declines in the financial condition, defaults, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial service companies or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity, asset quality or other problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. In addition, problems that arise in our relationships with financial services companies may result in a slow down or cessation in referrals that we receive from these financial services companies. These problems, losses or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure, including to monitor the value of and control marketable securities that collateralize our loans, and a failure of these parties to perform for any reason could disrupt our operations.\nThird parties provide key components of our business infrastructure such as loan and account servicing, data processing, internet connections, network access, core application processing, statement production and account analysis. Our business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. In addition, we utilize the systems of these third parties to provide information to us so that we can quickly and accurately monitor changes in the value of marketable securities that serve as collateral. We also rely on these parties to provide control over marketable securities for purposes of perfecting our security interests and retaining the collateral in the applicable accounts.\nThe failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions or impaired performance of our systems and technology due to malfunctions, programming inaccuracies or other circumstances or events. Replacing vendors or addressing other issues with our third-party service providers could entail significant delay and expense. If we are unable to efficiently replace ineffective service providers, or if we experience a significant, sustained or repeated, system failure or service denial, it could compromise our ability to effectively operate and assess and react to a risk in our loan portfolio, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business or financial damages from customer businesses, and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe could be subject to losses, regulatory action and reputational harm due to fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, our borrowers, our clients, our employees and our vendors.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements, property appraisals, title information, income documentation, account information and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of such information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Any such misrepresentation or incorrect or incomplete information may not be detected prior to funding a loan or during our ongoing monitoring of outstanding loans. In addition, one or more of our employees or vendors could cause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or fraud. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur growth and expansion strategy may involve strategic investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to overcome risks associated with such transactions.\nAlthough we plan to continue to grow our business organically, we may seek opportunities to invest in or acquire investment management businesses or other businesses that we believe would complement our existing business model. Any potential future investment or acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including significant time and expense required to identify, evaluate and negotiate potential transactions; an inability to attract acceptable funding; the limited experience of our management team in working together on acquisitions and integration activities; the time, expense and difficulty of integrating the combined businesses; an inability to realize expected synergies or returns on investment; potential disruption of our ongoing business; an inability to maintain adequate regulatory capital; and a loss of key employees or key customers. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance shareholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nNew lines of business or new or enhanced products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may develop, grow or acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing, implementing and marketing new lines of business or new or enhanced products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business or new or enhanced product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nIn our prior acquisitions, we have generally recognized intangible assets, including customer relationship intangible assets and goodwill, in our consolidated statements of financial condition, but we may not realize the value of these assets. Management performs an annual review of the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and periodically reviews the carrying values of all other intangible assets to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that an impairment in value may have occurred. Although we have determined that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired during 2019, a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or other factors could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the asset would occur, resulting in a non-cash charge which could result in a material charge to earnings and would adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnauthorized access, cyber-crime and other threats to data security may require significant resources, harm our reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nWe necessarily collect, use and hold personal and financial information concerning individuals and businesses with which we have a relationship. In addition, we provide our clients with the ability to bank and make investment decisions remotely, including over the internet. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks, rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to additional costs related to protection or remediation and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with customer expectations, statutory and regulatory privacy regulations, and other requirements. It is difficult or impossible to defend against every risk being posed by changing technologies, as well as the intent of criminals, terrorists or foreign governments or their agents with respect to committing cyber-crime. Because of the increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals and terrorists, data breaches could result despite our best efforts. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our internet-based product offerings and expand our internal use of web-based products and applications, and controls employed by our information technology department and our other employees and vendors could prove inadequate to resolve or mitigate these risks.\nWe could also experience a breach due to intentional or negligent conduct on the part of employees, vendors or other internal sources, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, or other causes. As a result of any of these threats, our customer accounts and the personal and financial information of our customers and employees may become vulnerable to account takeover schemes, identity theft or cyber-fraud. In addition, our customers use their own electronic devices to do business with us and may provide their information to a third party in connection with obtaining services from such third party. Our ability to assure security is limited in these instances. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may also become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, viruses and malware.\nA breach of our security or the security of any of our third-party vendors that results in unauthorized access to our data, including personal and financial information of our customers, could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs, regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage. Maintaining our security measures may also create risks associated with implementing and integrating new systems. In addition, our investment management business could be harmed by cyber incidents affecting issuers in which its customers\u2019 assets are invested, and our private banking business could be harmed by such incidents. Any such breaches of security or cyber incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nBeyond breaches of our security or the security of our third party vendors or their affiliates, as a result of financial entities and technology systems becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber-incident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact.\nWe are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third party service providers. We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties). Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to ensure that all of our clients, suppliers,\ncounterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of our customers or others were to be mishandled or misused, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose customers or potential customers and thereby reduce our revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject us to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Although we are committed to keeping pace with technological advances and to investing in new technology, our competitors may, through the use of new technologies that we have not implemented, whether due to cost or otherwise, be able to offer additional or superior products, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. We also may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, be successful in marketing such products and services or replace technologies that are out of date with new technologies, which could result in a loss of customers seeking new technology-driven products and services. In addition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays, may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws, and may cause us to incur additional expenses, which may be substantial. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and avoid interruptions, errors and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe may take tax filing positions or follow tax strategies that may be subject to challenge.\nThe amount of income taxes that we are required to pay on our earnings is based on federal and state legislation and regulations. We provide for current and deferred taxes in our financial statements based on our results of operations, business activity, legal structure and interpretation of tax statutes. We may take filing positions or follow tax strategies that are subject to audit and may be subject to challenge. Our net income may be reduced if a federal, state or local authority assesses charges for taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements. Taxing authorities could change applicable tax laws, challenge filing positions or assess taxes and interest charges. If taxing authorities take any of these actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected, perhaps materially.\nRisks Relating to Regulations\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, could subject us to regulatory action or penalties.\nBanking is highly regulated under federal and state law. We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision that governs almost all aspects of our operations. As a registered bank holding company, we are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. As a commercial bank chartered under the laws of Pennsylvania, TriState Capital Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC. Our investment management business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States. Chartwell and Chartwell TSC are subject to federal securities laws, principally the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and other regulations promulgated by various regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, stock exchanges, and applicable state laws. Our investment management business also may be subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association. Our investment management business also is affected by various regulations governing banks and other financial institutions. Failure to appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or regulatory policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nThe banking agencies have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks, including the authority, among other things, to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, require affirmative action to correct any violation or practice, issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced, direct increases in capital, direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets, limit dividends and distributions,\nrestrict growth, assess civil monetary penalties, remove officers and directors and, with respect to banks, terminate a bank\u2019s charter, terminate its deposit insurance or place a bank into conservatorship or receivership.\nIn addition to the safety and soundness focus, there are significant banking regulations relating to other aspects of our business, including borrower protection and community development. With respect to our community development obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, we have an approved CRA strategic plan for the years 2018 through 2020. While we currently believe we will succeed in obtaining approval for our CRA strategic plan commencing in 2021, we cannot guaranty that we will obtain such an approval, in which case we would be subject to the CRA for traditional large banks, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial of operation, financial condition and future prospects. For additional information, see \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Community Reinvestment Act.\u201d\nCompliance with the myriad laws and regulations applicable to our organization can be difficult and costly. In addition, these laws, regulations and policies are subject to continual review by governmental authorities, and changes to these laws, regulations and policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of these laws, regulations and policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and often impose additional compliance costs. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations, could make compliance more difficult or expensive. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nThe ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, could require significant management attention and resources and subject us to more stringent regulatory requirements.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act comprehensively reformed the regulation of financial institutions, products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. While a significant number of regulations have already been promulgated to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for lengthy periods. We may be forced to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes related to the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nFederal and state bank regulators periodically conduct examinations of our business and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities periodically conduct examinations of our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a bank regulatory agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or TriState Capital Bank were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us, TriState Capital Bank or our respective officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate TriState Capital Bank\u2019s charter or deposit insurance and place the Bank into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase.\nThe deposits of TriState Capital Bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject the Bank to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The Bank\u2019s regular assessments are determined by its risk category, which is based on a combination of its financial ratios and supervisory ratings, and which, among other things, generally demonstrates its regulatory capital levels and level of supervisory concern. Moreover, the FDIC has the unilateral authority to change deposit insurance assessment rates and the manner in which deposit insurance is calculated, and also to charge special assessments to FDIC-insured institutions. High levels of bank failures since 2007 and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased costs to the FDIC to resolve bank failures and have put significant pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund, the FDIC increased deposit insurance assessment rates and charged a special assessment to all FDIC-insured financial institutions. Further increases in assessment rates or special assessments may occur in the future, especially if there are significant additional financial institution failures.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act, or the CRA, and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, the Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with and enforcement action under the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports when appropriate. In addition to other bank regulatory agencies, the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with state and federal banking regulators, as well as the Department of Justice, the CFPB, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, and the Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by OFAC regarding, among other things, the prohibition of transacting business with, and the need to freeze assets of, certain persons and organizations identified as a threat to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. To comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in these areas, we have dedicated significant resources to our anti-money laundering program and OFAC compliance. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including any acquisitions we desire to make. We could also incur increased costs and expenses to improve our anti-money laundering procedures and systems to comply with any regulatory requirements or actions. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe are a holding company and we depend upon our subsidiaries for liquidity. Applicable laws and regulations, including capital and liquidity requirements, may restrict our ability to transfer funds from our subsidiaries to us or other subsidiaries.\nTriState Capital Holdings, Inc., as the parent company, is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries. We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, including the parent company. For instance, the parent company depends on distributions and other payments from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries to fund all payments on our other obligations, including debt obligations. Our bank and investment management subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. In addition, our bank and investment management subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend to or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. These limitations may hinder our ability to implement our business strategy which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nRisks Relating to an Investment in our Common Stock and Preferred Stock\nShares of our common stock, preferred stock and underlying depositary shares are not an insured deposit.\nShares of our common stock, preferred stock and underlying depositary shares are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. An investment in our common stock, preferred stock or underlying depositary shares has risks, and you may lose your entire investment.\nAn active, liquid market for our securities may not be sustained.\nOur common stock and depositary shares underlying our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are listed on Nasdaq, but we may be unable to meet continued listing standards. In addition, an active, liquid trading market for such securities may not be sustained. A public trading market having depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace and independent decisions\nof willing buyers and sellers of our common stock, over which we have no control. Without an active, liquid trading market for our common stock, shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times desired. The lack of an established market could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur preferred stock is thinly traded.\nThere is only a limited trading volume in our preferred stock due to the small size of the issue and its largely institutional holder base. Significant sales of our preferred stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the price of our preferred stock to fall substantially.\nThe market price of our securities may be subject to substantial fluctuations, which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThe market price of our common stock and depositary shares underlying our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock may be highly volatile, which may make it difficult to resell shares of our securities at the volume, prices and times desired. There are many factors that may impact the market price and trading volume of our securities, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or financial condition or general changes in economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, accounting standards, policies, interpretations or principles or in laws or regulations affecting us;\n\u2022\npublic reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements or our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us, our competitors, or the financial services industry or changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deemed comparable to us;\n\u2022\nadditional or anticipated sales of our common stock or other securities by us or our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding our competitors and/or us;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nother economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting our business; and\n\u2022\nother news, announcements or disclosures (whether by us or others) related to us, our competitors, our core market or the financial services industry.\nThe stock market has experienced substantial fluctuations in recent years, which in many cases have been unrelated to the operating performance and prospects of particular companies. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading volume in our common stock may cause significant price variations. Increased market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which could make it difficult to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nActual or anticipated issuances or sales of our securities in the future could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock, preferred stock and underlying depositary shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nActual or anticipated issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares could cause the market price of any of our securities to decline significantly and make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and on terms that we deem appropriate. The issuance of any shares of our securities also would, and the issuance of equity-related securities could, dilute the percentage ownership interest held by shareholders with respect to such security. We may issue additional equity securities, or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for equity securities, from time to time to raise additional capital, support growth or to make acquisitions. Further, we expect to issue stock options or other stock awards to retain and motivate our employees and directors. These issuances of securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of our existing shareholders, result in a significant decline in the market price of our common stock or other securities and make it more difficult for us to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nOur current management and board of directors have significant control over our business.\nOur directors, as well as their related parties, and executive officers beneficially own a material portion of our outstanding common stock. Consequently, our directors and executive officers, acting together, may be able to significantly affect the outcome of the election of directors and the potential outcome of other matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, such as mergers, the sale of substantially all of our assets and other corporate matters. The interests of these insiders could conflict with the interest of our shareholders.\nThe rights of holders of our common stock are generally subordinate to the rights of holders of our debt securities and preferred stock and may be subordinate to the rights of holders of any class of preferred stock or any debt securities that we may issue in the future.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue debt securities as well as an aggregate of up to 150,000 shares of preferred stock on the terms it determines without shareholder approval. In 2018, we issued 40,250 shares of our 6.75% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock in the form of $1.6 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In 2019, we issued 80,500 shares of our 6.375% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock in the form of $3.2 million depositary shares, each representing ownership of a 1/40th interest in a share of Series B Preferred Stock. Any debt or shares of preferred stock that we may issue in the future will be senior to our common stock. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts is uncertain. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nHolders of our preferred stock and the depositary shares will have limited voting rights.\nHolders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock and, accordingly, holders of the depositary shares, will have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of our voting common shareholders. Holders of preferred stock have voting rights that are generally limited to, with respect to the series of preferred stock held, (i) authorizing, creating or issuing any capital stock ranking senior to the such preferred stock as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, and (ii) amending, altering or repealing any provision of our Articles of Incorporation, so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of such series of preferred stock.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock and are subject to regulatory restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock since inception and have instead utilized our earnings to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, if we decide to pay dividends on our common stock in the future (and we have not made such a decision), we are subject to certain restrictions as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. Moreover, because TriState Capital Bank is our most significant asset, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders depends in large part on our receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is also subject to restrictions on dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. Finally, so long as any shares of our Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, unless we have paid in full (or declared and set aside funds sufficient for) applicable dividends on the Preferred Stock, we may not declare or pay any dividend on our common stock, other than a dividend payable solely in shares of common stock or in connection with a shareholder rights plan.\nOur corporate governance documents, and certain applicable corporate and banking laws, could make a takeover more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, our bylaws, as amended, and corporate and federal banking laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our organization or conduct a proxy contest, even if those events were perceived by many of our shareholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions, and the corporate and banking laws and regulations applicable to us:\n\u2022\nempower our board of directors, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock, the terms of which, including voting power, are set by our board of directors;\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into four classes serving staggered four-year terms;\n\u2022\neliminate cumulative voting in elections of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire the request of holders of at least 10% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote at a meeting to call a special shareholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022\nrequire at least 60 days\u2019 advance notice of nominations by shareholders for the election of directors and the presentation of shareholder proposals at meetings of shareholders; and\n\u2022\nrequire prior regulatory application and approval of any transaction involving control of our organization.\nThese provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, including circumstances in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the market price of our shares.\nThere are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies.\nWith certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, prospective investors need to be aware of and comply with these requirements, if applicable, in connection with any purchase of shares of our common stock. These provisions effectively inhibit certain mergers or other business combinations, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13943, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TSC"}
