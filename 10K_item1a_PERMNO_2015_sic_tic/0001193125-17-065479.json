{"cik": "1049502", "company": "MKS INSTRUMENTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following describes certain risks we face in our business. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOur business depends substantially on capital spending in the semiconductor industry, which is characterized by periodic fluctuations that may cause a reduction in demand for our products.\nApproximately 58%, 69% and 70% of our net revenues for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers. On a pro forma basis, assuming our acquisition of Newport occurred on January 1, 2016 rather than April 29, 2016, approximately 54% of our combined net revenues for 2016 would have been from such customers. While our acquisition of Newport has reduced our concentration of customers in these markets, we anticipate that sales to such customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues. Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers, which in turn depends upon the demand for semiconductors.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards. Because our customers face uncertainties with regard to the growth and requirements of these markets, their products and components may not achieve, or continue to achieve, anticipated levels of market acceptance. If our customers are unable to deliver products that gain market acceptance, it is likely that these customers will not purchase our products or will purchase smaller quantities of our products. We often invest substantial resources in developing our products and subsystems in advance of significant sales of these products and subsystems to such customers. A failure on the part of our\ncustomers\u2019 products to gain market acceptance, or a failure of the semiconductor market to grow would have a significant negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand. The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict, and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles. The cyclicality of the semiconductor market is demonstrated by the changes in sales to semiconductor capital equipment and device manufacturers in past years. For example, our sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers increased compared to the prior year by 33%, 3% and 19% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 33% increase in 2016 was mainly attributable to sales by Newport following our acquisition of Newport in April 2016. On a pro forma basis, assuming the acquisition of Newport had occurred on January 1, 2015, our 2016 increase would have been 14%.\nDuring semiconductor market downturns, periods of overcapacity have resulted in rapid and significantly reduced demand for our products, which may result in lower gross margins due to reduced absorption of manufacturing overhead, as our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term. Further, our ability to reduce our long-term expenses is constrained by our need to continue our investment in next-generation product technology and to support and service our products. In addition, due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the products and subsystems we sell to this market, we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we are unable to sell. Accordingly, downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Conversely, when upturns in this market occur, we may have difficulty rapidly and effectively increasing our manufacturing capacity to meet sudden increases in customer demand. If we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed. In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers have operations and customers in Asia, a region that in past years has experienced serious economic problems including currency devaluations, debt defaults, lack of liquidity and recessions.\nThe Newport Merger involves numerous risks, and we may not be able to effectively integrate Newport\u2019s business and operations or realize the expected benefits from the acquisition, which could materially harm our operating results.\nOur April 2016 acquisition of Newport has significantly increased our size, including with respect to revenue, product offerings, number of employees and facilities. Newport\u2019s products and technology, and certain of its markets and customer base, are significantly different from our historical experience. Combining our businesses could make it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers. Integrating Newport\u2019s business and operations with ours is complex, challenging and time-consuming and requires significant efforts and expenditures, and we may not be able to achieve the integration in an effective, complete, timely or cost-efficient manner.\nPotential risks related to our acquisition of Newport include our ability to:\n\u2022\nexpand our financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures to integrate and manage Newport;\n\u2022\nintegrate our information technology systems to enable the management and operation of the combined business;\n\u2022\nrealize expected synergies and cost savings resulting from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nmaintain and improve Newport\u2019s operations while integrating our combined manufacturing organization;\n\u2022\navoid lost revenue due to customer confusion and misinformation regarding the transaction, and retain and expand Newport\u2019s customer base while aligning our sales efforts;\n\u2022\navoid lost revenue resulting from the distraction or confusion of our personnel as a consequence of the acquisition and ongoing integration efforts;\n\u2022\nretain key Newport personnel;\n\u2022\nrecognize and capitalize on anticipated product sales and technology enhancement opportunities presented by our combined businesses;\n\u2022\nadequately familiarize ourselves with Newport\u2019s products and technology and certain of its markets and customer base such that we can manage Newport\u2019s business effectively; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate our respective corporate cultures such that we achieve the benefits of acting as a unified company.\nOther potential risks related to our acquisition of Newport include:\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown or contingent liabilities, or other unanticipated events or circumstances; and\n\u2022\nthe potential to incur or record significant cash or non-cash charges or write down the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill obtained in the Newport acquisition, which could adversely impact our cash flow or lower our earnings in the period or periods for which we incur such charges or write down such assets.\nIf we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of Newport\u2019s business into our business, we may be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition and our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have incurred and will continue to incur transaction-related costs, including legal, regulatory and other costs associated with implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset transaction and integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Further, we may not realize the expected benefits from the acquisition. Newport\u2019s business and operations may not achieve the anticipated revenues and operating results. We may in the future choose to close or divest certain sectors or divisions of Newport, which could require us to record losses and/or spend cash relating to such closures or divestitures. Any of the foregoing risks could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe terms of our term loan credit facility and asset-based revolving credit facility impose significant financial obligations and risks upon us, limit our ability to take certain actions, and could discourage a change in control.\nIn April 2016, we obtained a term loan credit facility and a revolving credit facility in connection with financing our acquisition of Newport, and we subsequently amended the term loan facility in June and December 2016 to reduce the interest rate spread. The term loan credit facility, as amended in December 2016, provides us with senior secured financing of $628 million with a term of seven years. The revolving credit facility provides us with senior secured financing of up to $50 million, subject to a borrowing base limitation.\nOur indebtedness under these credit facilities has increased our interest expense and could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. Our indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the acquisition, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nA significant portion of the amounts outstanding under the credit facilities bear interest at variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could\nadversely affect our cash flows. In addition, our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings of our indebtedness reflect each nationally recognized statistical rating organization\u2019s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future. Moreover, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThe term loan credit facility and the revolving credit facility contain a number of negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay certain dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire certain capital stock or certain other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, loans and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmaterially alter the business we conduct;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge;\n\u2022\nincur liens; and\n\u2022\nengage in sale-leaseback transactions.\nThese covenants restrict our ability to engage in or benefit from these actions, thereby limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in the markets in which we compete, such as limiting our ability to engage in mergers and acquisitions. This could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe term loan credit agreement and the revolving credit agreement contain customary events of default, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to make required payments;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with certain agreements or covenants;\n\u2022\nmaterially breaching any representation or warranty made or deemed made in connection with the respective credit facility;\n\u2022\nfailure to pay, or cause acceleration of, certain other indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncertain events of bankruptcy and insolvency;\n\u2022\nfailure to pay certain judgments; and\n\u2022\na change in control of us.\nOur ability to repay any amounts owed under these credit facilities will depend upon our future cash balances. The amount of cash available for repayment of these amounts will depend on our usage of our existing cash balances and our operating performance and ability to generate cash flow from operations in future periods, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot provide any assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to\nservice our debt obligations. Any failure to repay these obligations as they become due would result in an event of default under the credit facilities.\nFurther, because a change in control of us constitutes an event of default under these credit facilities, this would likely be a significant deterrent to a potential acquirer, as any potential acquisition would trigger an event of default, unless the lenders agreed to waive such event of default. We cannot guarantee that any such waiver would be obtained.\nIf an event of default occurs, the lenders may end their obligation to make loans to us under the credit facilities, and may declare any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facilities immediately due and payable. In such case, we would need to obtain additional financing or significantly deplete our available cash, or both, in order to repay this indebtedness. Any additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, and significant depletion of our available cash could harm our ability to fund our operations or execute our broader corporate objectives. If we were unable to repay outstanding indebtedness following an event of default, then in addition to other available rights and remedies, the lenders could initiate foreclosure proceedings on substantially all of our assets. Any such foreclosure proceedings or other rights and remedies successfully implemented by the lenders in an event of default would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated, and are likely to continue to vary significantly, which may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nA substantial portion of our shipments occurs shortly after an order is received, and therefore we generally operate with a relatively low level of backlog. As a result, a decrease in demand for our products from one or more customers could occur with limited advance notice and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period. Further, with respect to certain of our business lines, we often recognize a significant portion of net revenues in the last month of each fiscal quarter, due in part to the tendency of some customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase certain of our products as a result of capital expenditure approvals and constraints occurring at the end of a quarter, or the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from a competitor seeking the business. Thus, variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly sales, gross margin and profitability. Orders expected to ship in one period could shift to another period due to changes in the timing of our customers\u2019 purchase decisions, rescheduled delivery dates requested by our customers, manufacturing capacity constraints or logistics delays. Our operating results for a particular quarter or year may be adversely affected if our customers, particularly our largest customers, cancel or reschedule orders, or if we cannot fill orders in time due to capacity constraints or unexpected delays in manufacturing, testing, shipping or product acceptance. Also, we base our manufacturing plans on our forecasted product mix. If the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast, we may not be able to fill some orders, which would result in delays in the shipment of our products and could shift sales to a subsequent period. A significant percentage of our expenses are fixed and based in part on expectations of future net revenues. The inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any shortfall would magnify the adverse impact of a shortfall in net revenues on our results of operations. Factors that could cause fluctuations in our financial results include:\n\u2022\na worldwide economic slowdown or disruption in the global financial markets;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our customers\u2019 capital spending, industry cyclicality (particularly in the semiconductor industry), market seasonality (particularly in the scientific research market), levels of government funding available to our customers (particularly in the life sciences and research markets) and other economic conditions within the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the receipt of orders within a given period and the level of orders from major customers;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and the products sold by our customers;\n\u2022\nshipment delays;\n\u2022\ndisruption in sources of supply;\n\u2022\nproduction capacity constraints;\n\u2022\nspecific features requested by customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing and level of cancellations and delays of orders in backlog for our products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of product shipments and revenue recognition within a given quarter;\n\u2022\nvariations in the mix of products we sell;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing practices or in the pricing practices of our competitors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nour timing in introducing new products;\n\u2022\nengineering and development investments relating to new product introductions, and significant changes to our manufacturing and outsourcing operations;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of any new or enhanced versions of our products;\n\u2022\ntiming of new product introductions by our competitors;\n\u2022\ntiming and level of inventory obsolescence, scrap and warranty expenses;\n\u2022\nthe availability, quality and cost of components and raw materials we use to manufacture our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in our effective tax rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, including cash, marketable securities and debt balances, and changes in interest rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in bad debt expense based on the collectability of our accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ntiming, type, and size of acquisitions and divestitures, and related expenses and charges;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the Korean won, Japanese yen and Euro as compared with the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nour expense levels;\n\u2022\nimpairment of goodwill and amortization of intangible assets; and\n\u2022\nfees, expenses and settlement costs or judgments against us relating to litigation.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, it is likely that we may in the future experience quarterly or annual fluctuations, and that, in one or more future quarters, our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. In any such event, the price of our common stock could fluctuate or decline significantly. Consequently, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of our results of operations, or any other similar period-to-period comparisons, may not be reliable indicators of our future performance.\nThe loss of net revenues from any one of our major customers would likely have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur top ten customers accounted for approximately 39%, 49% and 50% of our net revenues for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. One customer, Applied Materials, Inc., accounted for approximately 14%, 18% and 19% of our net revenues for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and another customer, Lam Research Corporation, accounted for 11%, 13% and 13% of our net revenues for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues. Although our acquisition of Newport has reduced our customer concentration somewhat, the loss of a major customer or any reduction in orders by these customers, including\nreductions due to market or competitive conditions, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. None of our significant customers has entered into an agreement with us requiring it to purchase any minimum quantity of our products. The demand for our products from our semiconductor capital equipment customers depends on the cyclicality of our served markets, specifically semiconductor device manufacturer customers.\nAttempts to lessen the adverse effect of any loss or reduction of net revenues through the rapid addition of new customers could be difficult because a relatively small number of companies dominate the semiconductor equipment market. Further, prospective customers typically require lengthy qualification periods prior to placing volume orders with a new supplier. Our future success will continue to depend upon:\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain relationships with existing key customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers and satisfy any required qualification periods;\n\u2022\nour ability to introduce new products in a timely manner for existing and new customers; and\n\u2022\nthe successes of our customers in creating demand for their capital equipment products that incorporate our products.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to identify and complete, challenging and costly to integrate, disruptive to our business and our management, and/or dilutive to stockholder value.\nSince our inception, we have made acquisitions and, as a part of our business strategy, we may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions. Our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition targets, complete acquisitions on acceptable terms, and efficiently and effectively integrate our acquired businesses into our organization is critical to our growth. We may not be able to identify target companies that meet our strategic objectives or successfully negotiate and complete acquisitions with companies we have identified on acceptable terms. Additionally, our credit facilities only permit us to make acquisitions under certain circumstances, and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Further, the process of integrating acquired companies into our operations requires significant resources and is time consuming, expensive and disruptive to our business. We may not realize the benefits we anticipate from these acquisitions because of the following significant challenges:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating the operations, technology and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\npossible internal control weaknesses of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nsignificant expenses related to the acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses;\n\u2022\npotentially incompatible cultural differences between the two companies;\n\u2022\nincorporating the acquired company\u2019s technology and products into our current and future product lines, and successfully generating market demand for these expanded product lines;\n\u2022\npotential additional geographic dispersion of operations;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in achieving anticipated synergies and efficiencies;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in leveraging the acquired company\u2019s and our combined technologies and capabilities across our product lines and customer base;\n\u2022\npotential sales disruptions as a result of integrating the acquired company\u2019s sales channels with our sales channels; and\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key customers, suppliers and employees of an acquired company.\nWe may also be placed at a competitive disadvantage by selling products in markets and geographies that are new to us. In addition, if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, we may be required to re-evaluate our growth strategy, and we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete proposed acquisitions that may not generate benefits for us.\nIn addition, with future acquisitions, we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price. We could also issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions, which could cause significant stockholder dilution, or obtain additional debt financing, which could reduce our future cash flow, without achieving the desired accretion to our business. Further, our prior acquisitions and any future acquisitions may not ultimately help us achieve our strategic goals and may pose other risks to us.\nAs a result of our previous acquisitions, we have several different decentralized operating and accounting systems. We will need to continue to modify our accounting policies, internal controls, procedures and compliance programs to provide consistency across all of our operations. In order to increase efficiency and operating effectiveness and improve corporate visibility into our decentralized operations, we are currently implementing two worldwide Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems, one for our Vacuum & Analysis segment and one for our Light & Motion segment. We expect to continue to implement the ERP systems in phases over the next few years. Any future implementations may risk potential disruption of our operations during the conversion periods and the implementations could require significantly more management time and higher implementation costs than currently estimated.\nAn inability to convince semiconductor device manufacturers to specify the use of our products to our customers that are semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers would weaken our competitive position.\nThe markets for our products, in particular the semiconductor capital equipment market, are highly competitive. Our competitive success often depends upon factors outside of our control. For example, in some cases, particularly with respect to mass flow controllers, semiconductor device manufacturers may direct semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers to use a specified supplier\u2019s product in their equipment. Accordingly, for such products, our success will depend in part on our ability to have semiconductor device manufacturers specify that our products be used at their semiconductor fabrication facilities. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in changing established relationships of competitors that already have a large installed base of products within such semiconductor fabrication facilities.\nIf our products are not designed into successive generations of our customers\u2019 products, we will lose significant net revenues during the lifespan of those products.\nNew products designed by capital equipment manufacturers typically have a lifespan of five to ten years. Our success depends on our products being designed into new generations of equipment. We must develop products that are technologically advanced so that they are positioned to be chosen for use in each successive generation of capital equipment. If customers do not choose our products, our net revenues may be reduced during the lifespan of our customers\u2019 products. In addition, we must make a significant capital investment to develop products for our customers well before our products are introduced and before we can be sure that we will recover our capital investment through sales to the customers in significant volume. We are thus also at risk during the development phase that our products may fail to meet our customers\u2019 technical or cost requirements and may be replaced by a competitive product or alternative technology solution. If that happens, we may be unable to recover our development costs.\nThe semiconductor industry is subject to rapid demand shifts which are difficult to predict. As a result, our inability to expand our manufacturing capacity or reduce our fixed costs in response to these rapid shifts may cause a reduction in our market share.\nOur ability to increase sales of certain products depends in part upon our ability to expand our manufacturing capacity for such products in a timely manner. If we are unable to expand our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or to manage such expansion effectively, our customers could implement our competitors\u2019 products and, as a result, our market share could be reduced. Because the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid demand shifts, which are difficult to foresee, we may not be able to increase capacity quickly enough to respond to a rapid increase in demand. Additionally, capacity expansion could increase our fixed operating expenses and if sales levels do not increase to offset the additional expense levels associated with any such expansion, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of the markets and industries that we serve are subject to rapid technological change, and if we fail to introduce new and innovative products or improve our existing products, or if the adoption or applications we serve is not successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nMany of our markets are characterized by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, shifting customer needs, new product introductions and enhancements, and the periodic introduction of disruptive technology that displaces current technology due to a combination of price, performance and reliability. As a result, many of the products in our markets can become outdated quickly and without warning. We depend, to a significant extent, upon our ability to enhance our existing products, to anticipate and address the demands of the marketplace for new and improved and disruptive technologies, either through internal development or by acquisitions, and to be price competitive. If we or our competitors introduce new or enhanced products, it may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products. If we or our competitors introduce disruptive technology that displaces current technology, existing product platforms or lines of business from which we generate significant revenue may be rendered obsolete.\nBecause many of our products are sophisticated and complex, they can be difficult to design and manufacture, and we may experience delays in introducing new products or enhancements to our existing products. If we do not introduce our new products or enhancements into the marketplace in a timely fashion, our customers may choose to purchase our competitors\u2019 products. Certain of our markets, in particular the semiconductor capital equipment market, experience severe cyclicality in capital spending, so if we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner we may miss market upturns, or may fail to have our products or subsystems designed into our customers\u2019 products. We may not be successful in acquiring, developing, manufacturing or marketing new products and technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis. If we fail to adequately introduce new, competitive products and technologies on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nFurther, we are constantly investing in products for emerging applications, and we expect to generate increasingly significant revenue levels from sales of products for these applications. These applications are evolving, and the extent to which they achieve widespread adoption or significant growth is uncertain. Many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption or growth of these applications, including their cost-effectiveness, performance and reliability compared to alternatives. If these applications or our products for these applications are not widely adopted or fail to grow as we project, we will not generate the revenue growth we anticipate from sales of our products for these emerging applications, and our results of operations could be harmed.\nBecause the sales cycle for some of our products is long and difficult to predict, and certain of our orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation, we may experience fluctuations in our operating results.\nMany of our products are complex and customers for these products require substantial time to qualify our products and make purchase decisions. In addition, some of our sales to defense and security customers are under\nmajor defense programs that involve lengthy competitive bidding and qualification processes. These customers often perform, or require us to perform, extensive configuration, testing and evaluation of our products before committing to purchasing them, which can require a significant upfront investment by us. The sales cycle for these products from initial contact through shipment varies significantly, is difficult to predict and can last more than a year. If we fail to anticipate the likelihood, costs, or timing associated with sales of these products, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur orders are generally subject to rescheduling without penalty or cancellation without penalty other than reimbursement for certain labor and material costs. We from time to time experience order rescheduling and cancellations, which can result in fluctuation of our operating results from period to period.\nCertain of our markets, sales regions and customers may be adversely affected by a lack of government funding and the availability of credit.\nOur worldwide sales to customers in the scientific research, defense and life and health sciences markets rely to a large extent on government funding for research and defense-related programs. Any decline in government funding as a result of reduced budgets in connection with fiscal austerity measures or other causes would likely result in reduced sales of our products that are purchased either directly or indirectly with government funding, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOngoing concerns regarding the global availability of credit also may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their projects and purchases of capital equipment. Delays in our customers\u2019 ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing, could adversely affect sales of our products and systems, including, but not limited to, high-value lasers and systems, and therefore harm our business and operating results.\nWe offer products for multiple markets and must face the challenges of supporting the distinct needs of each of the markets we serve.\nWe offer products for a number of markets. Because we operate in multiple markets, we must work constantly to understand the needs, standards and technical requirements of many different applications within these markets, and must devote significant resources to developing different products for these markets. Product development is costly and time consuming. We must anticipate trends in our customers\u2019 industries and develop products before our customers\u2019 products are commercialized. If we do not accurately predict our customers\u2019 needs and future activities, we may invest substantial resources in developing products that do not achieve broad market acceptance. Our decision to continue to offer products to a given market or to penetrate new markets is based in part on our judgment of the size, growth rate and other factors that contribute to the attractiveness of a particular market. If our product offerings in any particular market are not competitive or our analyses of a market are incorrect, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nManufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.\nOur business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies (parts) from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:\n\u2022\nvolatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;\n\u2022\ninformation technology or infrastructure failures; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where we or our subcontractors and contract manufacturers conduct manufacturing.\nIn addition, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on our working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for our products is different than expected, we may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if our customers reduce or delay orders, we may incur excess inventory charges. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA material amount of our assets represents goodwill and intangible assets, and our net income would be reduced if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our goodwill and intangible assets, net, represented approximately $997 million, or 45% of our total assets. Goodwill is generated in our acquisitions when the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets we acquire. Goodwill is subject to an impairment analysis at least annually based on the fair value of the reporting unit. Intangible assets relate primarily to the developed technologies, customer relationships and patents and trademarks acquired by us as part of our acquisitions of other companies and are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of the intangible asset might not be recoverable. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. If market and economic conditions or business performance deteriorate, the likelihood that we would record an impairment charge would increase, which impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive, and we believe that competition from both new and existing competitors will increase in the future. Principal competitive factors include:\n\u2022\nhistorical customer relationships;\n\u2022\nproduct quality, performance and price;\n\u2022\nbreadth of product line;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing capabilities; and\n\u2022\ncustomer service and support.\nAlthough we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, we may not be able to continue to do so. We encounter substantial competition in most of our product lines. Certain of our competitors may enjoy greater name recognition and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and some may have lower material costs than ours due to their control over sources of components and raw materials. In some cases, competitors are smaller than we are, but well established in specific product niches. We may encounter difficulties in changing established relationships of competitors with a large installed base of products at such customers\u2019 fabrication facilities. In addition, our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products. Competitors may develop products that offer price, performance or technological features superior to those of our products. If our competitors develop superior products, we may lose existing customers and market share. Further, technological advances in our served markets may cause one or more of our portfolio of products to be displaced over time. We also face competition\nin some of our markets from our existing and potential customers who have developed or may develop products that are competitive to ours, or who engage subcontract manufacturers or system integrators to manufacture products or systems on their behalf.\nWe face significant risks from doing business internationally.\nOur business is subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally. International revenues account for a significant portion of total net sales, with a substantial portion of such sales originating in Asia (especially Korea, Japan, Israel, China and Taiwan) and Europe (especially France and Germany). We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of total net sales for the foreseeable future, and that in particular, the proportion of our sales to Asian customers will continue to increase. Additionally, we have substantial international manufacturing, sales and administrative operations, with significant facilities and employee populations in Europe, Israel and Asia. Our international operations expose us to various risks, which include:\n\u2022\nadverse changes or instability in the political or economic conditions in countries or regions where we manufacture or sell our products;\n\u2022\nchallenges of administering our diverse business and product lines globally;\n\u2022\nthe actions of government regulatory authorities, including embargoes, executive orders, import and export restrictions, tariffs, currency controls, trade restrictions and trade barriers, license requirements, environmental and other regulatory requirements and other rules and regulations applicable to the manufacture, import and export of our products, all of which are complicated and potentially conflicting, often require significant investments in cost, time and resources for compliance, and may impose strict and severe penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\ngreater risk of violations of applicable U.S. and international anti-corruption laws by our employees, sales representatives, distributors or other agents;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection periods and longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\noverlapping, differing or more burdensome tax structures;\n\u2022\nadverse currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nreduced or inconsistent protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022\nshipping and other logistics complications;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with the repatriation of our overseas earnings;\n\u2022\nthe expropriation of private enterprises;\n\u2022\nmore complex and burdensome labor laws and practices in countries where we have employees;\n\u2022\ncultural and management style differences;\n\u2022\npreference for locally-produced products;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the formation of labor unions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing each of our individual international operations; and\n\u2022\nincreased risk of exposure to civil unrest, terrorist and military activities.\nIf we experience any of the risks associated with international business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed.\nIn particular, we have significant facilities and operations and a considerable number of employees in Israel. A number of our products are manufactured in facilities located in Israel. The Middle East remains a volatile region, and the future of peace efforts between Israel and neighboring countries remains extremely uncertain. Any armed conflicts or significant political instability in the region is likely to negatively affect business conditions and could significantly disrupt our operations in Israel, which would negatively impact our business. Further, many of our employees in Israel are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances. If a military conflict or war arises, these individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time, and our operations in Israel could be disrupted by the absence of one or more key employees or a significant number of other employees for a significant period of time. Any such disruption could adversely affect our business.\nOur failure to successfully manage our offshore manufacturing locations or the transition of certain of our manufacturing operations to other locations and/or to contract manufacturers could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our continuous cost-reduction efforts, we have outsourced a portion of our manufacturing and service to a subcontractor in Mexico, and we continue to relocate the manufacture of certain of our existing product lines and subassemblies to, and initiate the manufacture of certain new products in, our facilities in China, Israel and Romania and selected contract manufacturers in Asia. In the future, we may expand the level of manufacturing and certain other operations that we perform offshore in order to take advantage of cost efficiencies available to us in those countries. However, we may not achieve the significant cost savings or other benefits that we would anticipate from moving manufacturing and other operations to a lower cost region. Additionally, if we are unable to successfully manage the relocation or initiation of the manufacture of these products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIn particular, transferring product lines to other manufacturing locations and/or to our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities often requires us to transplant complex manufacturing equipment and processes across a large geographical distance and to train a completely new workforce concerning the use of this equipment and these processes. In addition, certain of our customers may require the requalification of products supplied to them in connection with the relocation of manufacturing operations. If we are unable to manage this transfer and training smoothly and comprehensively, or if we are unable to complete the requalification of products in a timely manner, we could suffer manufacturing and supply chain delays, excessive product defects, harm to our results of operations and our reputation with our customers, and loss of customers. We also may not realize the cost and tax advantages that we currently anticipate from locating operations in Mexico, China, Israel and Romania. For example, we are experiencing rising material, labor and shipping costs in China and the potential for new tariffs on our products manufactured in Mexico.\nAdditionally, qualifying contract manufacturers and commencing volume production are expensive and time-consuming activities, and there is no guarantee we will continue to do so successfully. Further, our reliance on contract manufacturers reduces our control over the assembly process, quality assurance, production costs and material and component supply for our products. If we fail to manage our relationship with our contract manufacturers, or if any of the contract manufacturers experience financial difficulty, or delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed. Further, if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to negotiate with suppliers for reduced component costs, our operating results could be harmed.\nIn addition, our contract manufacturers may terminate our agreements with them upon prior notice to us or immediately for reasons such as if we become insolvent, or if we fail to perform a material obligation under the agreements. If we are required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal manufacturing operations for any reason, including the termination of one of our contracts, we will likely suffer manufacturing and shipping delays, lost revenue, increased costs and damage to our customer relationships, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products could contain defects, which would increase our costs and seriously harm our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships.\nMany of our products are inherently complex in design and, in some cases, require ongoing regular maintenance. Further, the manufacture of these products often involves a highly complex and precise process and the utilization of specially qualified components that conform to stringent specifications. As a result of the technical complexity of these products, design defects, changes in our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or nonconforming materials by us or our suppliers could adversely affect our manufacturing yields and product reliability. This could in turn harm our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships.\nWe provide warranties for our products, and we accrue allowances for estimated warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue for the sale of the products. The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty. We establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for our products. If actual return rates or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other suppliers, which may contain defects. As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things:\n\u2022\nloss of customers;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of product returns and warranty expenses;\n\u2022\nincreased costs required to analyze and mitigate the defects or problems;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nfailure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development and engineering resources; and/or\n\u2022\nlegal action by our customers.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are subject to potential product liability claims which, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our products may be hazardous if not operated properly or if defective. In addition, some of our products, such as certain ultrafast lasers, are used in medical applications where malfunctions could result in serious injury. We are exposed to significant risks for product liability claims if death, personal injury or property damage results from the use of our products. We may experience material product liability losses in the future. We currently maintain insurance against product liability claims. However, our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on terms that we accept, if at all. This insurance coverage also may not adequately cover liabilities that we incur. Further, if our products are defective, we may be required to recall or redesign these products. A successful claim against us that exceeds our insurance coverage level or that is not covered by insurance, or any product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to international trade compliance regulations, and violations of those regulations could result in fines or trade restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to trade compliance laws in both the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate. For example, exports of our products and technology developed or manufactured in the U.S. are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. Government and administered by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. Similar export regulations govern exports of our products and technology developed or manufactured in certain other countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Israel and Romania. In certain instances, these regulations may require obtaining licenses from the administering agency prior to exporting products or technology to international locations or foreign nationals, including foreign nationals employed by us in the United States and abroad. For products and technology subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product and technology, the final destination and the identity and nationality of the end user. Virtually all exports from the United States of defense articles subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, administered by the Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license. The Israeli Ministry of Economy and the Defense Export Control Agency of the Israeli Ministry of Defense administer similar export regulations and license requirements, which apply to many of our products and technology developed or manufactured in Israel. Obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming, and we may not be successful in obtaining them. Failure to obtain export licenses to enable product and technology exports could reduce our revenue, harm our relationships with our customers and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with export regulations may also subject us to additional fees and costs. The absence of comparable export restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, if we or our international representatives or distributors fail to comply with any of these export regulations, we or they could be subject to civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, restrictions on our ability to export products and technology and damage to our reputation, and our business and results of operations could be significantly harmed. While we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws, we cannot be certain that our employees, contractors, suppliers or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. For example, as a result of a 2012 U.S. Government investigation, a former employee of our Shanghai office and a third party not affiliated with us were imprisoned for export violations relating to the sale of certain of our products. We were not a target of the government\u2019s investigation and we cooperated fully with the government\u2019s investigation. In addition, although we conducted our own internal investigation and took corrective human resources actions and have, since 2012, implemented additional export compliance procedures, we cannot be certain these efforts will be sufficient to avoid similar situations in the future.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may lead to lower operating margins or may cause us to raise or reduce prices, which could result in reduced sales.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and results of operations and we could experience losses with respect to our hedging activities. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase or decrease prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net revenues from such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely affected by declining net revenues or profit margins for our products in international markets when the sales are translated into U.S. dollars. Such exchange rate fluctuations could also increase the costs and expenses of our non-U.S. operations when translated into U.S. dollars or require us to modify our current business practices. In addition, most sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold and the currency they receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce a portion of our currency exposure arising from intercompany sales of inventory as well as intercompany accounts receivable and intercompany loans. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks.\nChanges in tax rates or tax regulation could affect results of operations.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our future annual and quarterly effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the applicable tax laws; composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; and/or valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, we are subject to regular examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nKey personnel may be difficult to attract and retain.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our business is directly related to the service of our employees in each area of our business. Our future performance will be directly tied to our ability to hire, train, motivate and retain qualified personnel, including highly skilled technical, financial, managerial and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for personnel in the technology marketplace is intense, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced attrition in certain key positions, and we expect to continue to experience this attrition in the future. The absence of incentive plan bonuses and equity award vesting as a result of not meeting certain financial performance targets could adversely affect our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. If we are unable to hire sufficient numbers of employees with the experience and skills we need or to retain and motivate our existing employees, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nA breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on various information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, including confidential data, and to carry out and support a variety of business activities, including manufacturing, research and development, supply chain management, sales and accounting. A failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our suppliers and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, damage our reputation, cause losses and increase our costs.\nOur proprietary technology is important to the continued success of our business. Our failure to protect this proprietary technology may significantly impair our competitive position.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights. The steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in countries outside the United States, where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Patent and trademark laws and trade secret protection may not be adequate to deter third party infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks and similar proprietary rights. In addition, patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Our rights granted under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us, and the claims under our patent applications may not be allowed. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which can demand significant financial and management resources. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications. Moreover, our existing patents or any new patents that may be issued may not be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful\nprotection or any commercial advantage to us. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights in order to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors, which claims could result in costly litigation, the diversion of our technical and management personnel and the assertion of counterclaims by the defendants, including counterclaims asserting invalidity of our patents. We will take such actions where we believe that they are of sufficient strategic or economic importance to us to justify the cost. For example, in 2012 we filed a lawsuit against Lighthouse Photonics Incorporated asserting infringement of certain of our patents by that company\u2019s laser products, which we settled on confidential terms in August 2014. If we are unsuccessful at effectively protecting our intellectual property, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, intellectual property infringement claims, which could be costly and time consuming to defend and may produce outcomes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have from time to time received claims from third parties alleging that we are infringing certain trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. Such infringement claims have in the past and may in the future result in litigation. Any such litigation could be protracted and costly, and we could become subject to damages for infringement, or to an injunction preventing us from selling one or more of our products or using one or more of our trademarks. Such claims could also result in the necessity of obtaining a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or develop substitute technology may divert management\u2019s attention from other matters and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the terms of our customer contracts typically require us to indemnify the customer in the event of any claim of infringement brought by a third party based on our products. Any claims of this kind may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate for reasons over which we have no control.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, extreme price and volume fluctuations. Prices of securities of technology companies have been especially volatile and have often fluctuated for reasons that are unrelated to the operating performance of the companies. Historically, the market price of shares of our common stock has fluctuated greatly and could continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation. If we were the object of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends when and if they are declared by our board of directors. Further, our credit facilities restrict our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock under certain circumstances. Although we have declared cash dividends on our common stock since 2011, we are not required to do so and we may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, and international suppliers, could affect our ability to manufacture products and systems.\nWe rely on sole and limited source suppliers and international suppliers for a few of our components and subassemblies that are critical to the manufacturing of our products due to unique component designs as well as\nspecialized quality and performance requirements needed to manufacture our products. This reliance involves several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components;\n\u2022\nreduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components; and\n\u2022\nthe potential inability of our suppliers to develop technologically advanced products to support our growth and development of new products.\nWe believe we could obtain and qualify alternative sources for most sole and limited source and international supplier parts; however, the transition time may be long if we were required to obtain alternative sources. Seeking alternative sources for these parts could require us to redesign our systems, resulting in increased costs and likely shipping delays. In such an event, any inability to redesign our systems could result in further costs and shipping delays. These increased costs would decrease our profit margins if we could not pass the costs to our customers. Further, shipping delays could damage our relationships with current and potential customers and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we obtain some of the critical capital equipment we use to manufacture certain of our products from sole or limited sources due to the unique nature of the equipment. In some cases, such equipment can only be serviced by the manufacturer or a very limited number of service providers due to the complex and specialized nature of the equipment. If service and/or spare parts for such equipment become unavailable, such equipment could be rendered inoperable, which could cause delays in the production of our products, and could require us to procure alternate equipment, if available, which would likely involve long lead times and significant additional cost, and could harm our results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations. If we fail to comply with these regulations, our business could be harmed.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and the cleanup of contaminated sites. In the United States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), and we are subject to comparable authorities in other countries. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAlthough we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by state and federal laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims by employees or third parties alleging such contamination or injury, and could be liable for damages, which liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage (if any) and the resources of our business.\nCertain portions of the soil at Spectra-Physics\u2019 former facility located in Mountain View, California, and certain portions of the aquifer surrounding the facility, through which contaminated groundwater flowed, are part of an EPA-designated Superfund site and are subject to a cleanup and abatement order from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. Spectra-Physics, which Newport acquired in 2004, along with other entities with facilities located near the Mountain View, California facility, were identified as Responsible Parties with respect to this Superfund site, due to releases of hazardous substances during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Spectra-Physics and the other Responsible Parties entered into a cost-sharing agreement covering the costs of\nremediating the off-site groundwater impact. The site is mature, and investigations, monitoring and remediation efforts by the Responsible Parties have been ongoing for approximately 30 years. However, we will likely be subject to additional remediation obligations in the future if the EPA and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board determine that the site cleanup requires additional measures to ensure that it meets current standards for environmental contamination. In addition to our investigation, monitoring and remediation obligations, we may be liable for property damage or personal injury claims relating to this site. While we are not aware of any material claims at this time, such claims could be made against us in the future. We have certain ongoing costs related to investigation, monitoring and remediation of the site that have been fairly consistent and not material in the recent past. However, our ultimate costs of remediation and other potential liabilities are difficult to predict. If significant costs or other liability relating to this site arise in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe environmental regulations that we are subject to include a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental regulations that restrict the use and disposal of materials used in the manufacture of our products or require design changes or recycling of our products. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of manufacturing or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to equip our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product and the management of historical waste.\nGovernmental entities at all levels are continuously enacting new environmental regulations, and it is initially difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the requirements for compliance with such regulations as they are enacted. For example, the European Union has enacted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (\u201cRoHS\u201d) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (\u201cWEEE\u201d) for implementation in each European Union member country. RoHS regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in certain products, and WEEE requires the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from certain products. Effective January 2013, RoHS was recast to expand the scope of equipment subject to the directive and impose new compliance requirements, and most European Union member states implemented the recast directive during 2013. WEEE was also recast to expand the scope of equipment subject to the directive and impose increased combined reuse/recycling and collection targets, among other revisions, and European Union member states began to implement the recast directive in 2014. Certain of our products sold in these countries are or will become subject to RoHS and WEEE requirements. We will continue to monitor RoHS and WEEE guidance in individual jurisdictions to determine our responsibilities. In some instances, we are not directly responsible for compliance with RoHS and WEEE because certain of our products are currently outside the scope of the directives. However, because the scope of the directives continues to expand, we will likely be directly or contractually subject to certain provisions of such regulations in the case of many of our products. In addition, certain of our customers, particularly OEM customers whose end products may be subject to these directives, may require that the products we supply to them comply with these directives. Further, final legislation from individual jurisdictions that have not yet implemented the directives may impose different or additional responsibilities upon us. We are also aware of similar legislation that is currently in force or being considered in various states within the United States, as well as other countries, such as Japan, China and South Korea. These regulations may require us to redesign our products or source alternative components to ensure compliance with applicable requirements, for example by mandating the use of different types of materials in certain components. Any such redesign or alternative sourcing may increase the cost of our products, adversely impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions, or in some cases limit the markets for certain products. Our failure to comply with any of such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in certain countries.\nRegulations and customer demands related to conflict minerals and hazardous materials may adversely affect us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the implementing regulations subsequently adopted by the SEC impose disclosure requirements regarding the use in our products of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, whether or not the components of our products are manufactured by us or third parties. In addition, certain of our customers have requested that we disclose to them our use of numerous hazardous materials in our products. Our supply chain is very complex and the implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, there are additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements and customer requests, such as costs related to our due diligence to determine the source of any \u201cconflict minerals\u201d or the identity of any hazardous materials used in our products. We face the additional challenge that many of our suppliers, both domestic and foreign, are not obligated by the new \u201cconflict minerals\u201d law to investigate their own supply chain. Despite our due diligence efforts, we may be unable to verify the origin of all \u201cconflict minerals\u201d used in our products and/or the use of one or more hazardous materials in our products. As a result, we may be unable to certify that our products are \u201cconflict-free\u201d and/or free of certain hazardous materials. If we are unable to meet our customer requirements, customers may discontinue purchasing from us, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results.\nSome provisions of our restated articles of organization, as amended, our amended and restated by-laws and Massachusetts law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.\nAnti-takeover provisions could diminish the opportunities for stockholders to participate in tender offers, including tender offers at a price above the then current market price of our common stock. Such provisions may also inhibit increases in the market price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts. For example, while we have no present plans to issue any preferred stock, our board of directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of us. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, including the loss of voting control to others. In addition, our amended and restated by-laws provide for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes. Our classified board could also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our Company.\nChanges in financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices could have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Such changes may adversely affect our reported financial results or may impact our related business practice.", "PERMNO": 86778, "SIC": 3823, "TIC": "MKSI"}
