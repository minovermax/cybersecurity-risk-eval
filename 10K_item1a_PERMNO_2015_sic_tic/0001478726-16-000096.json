As a financial institution, we are under continuous threat of loss due to the swiftness and sophistication of hacking and cyber-attacks. This risk, although considerable at the present, will only increase in the future. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are electronic fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from electronic fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer accounts or our own accounts. The attempts to breach sensitive customer data, such as account numbers, social security numbers, or other personal information are less frequent but would present significant legal and/or regulatory costs to us if successful, as well as potentially damage our reputation among the markets we serve. Our risk and exposure to these matters will remain relevant because of the evolving nature and complexity of the threats posed by cybercriminals and hackers along with our plans to continue to provide Internet banking and mobile banking avenues for transacting business. While we have not experienced material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches to date, we have been the subject of attempted hacking and cyber-attacks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future.\nThe occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result in material adverse consequences including damage to our reputation and the loss of current or potential customers. We also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny due to such an occurrence. Litigation or regulatory actions in turn could lead to material liability, including, but not limited to, fines and penalties or reimbursement to customers adversely affected by a data breach. Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of events affecting us directly, successful attacks or systems failures at other financial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in our company.\nWe continually review our network and systems security and make the necessary investments to improve the resiliency of our systems and their security from attack. Nonetheless, there remains the risk that we may be materially harmed by a cyber-attack or information security breach. Methods used to attack information systems continue to evolve in sophistication, swiftness, and frequency and can occur from a variety of sources, such as foreign governments, hacktivists, or other well-financed entities, and may originate from remote and less regulated areas of the world. If such an attack or breach were to occur, we might not be able to address and find a solution in a timely and adequate manner. We will, however, promptly take reasonable and customary measures to address the situation.\nIf we are unable to replace the revenue we expect to derive from the interest income and continued realization of accretable discounts on our acquired loans with new loans and other interest earning assets, our financial condition and earnings may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the three FDIC-assisted acquisitions between 2009 and 2011, as well as the acquisition of CBS in 2016, and the asset discount bids associated with each acquisition, a significant portion of our income in recent years has been derived from the interest income and continued realization of accretable discounts on the loans that we purchased in our acquisitions. For the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recognized $14.6 million, $6.7 million, and $8.2 million, respectively, of net loans receivable and accretion income including amortization of loss share receivable on acquired loans, with $4.4 million, $3.6 million, and $3.1 million, respectively, due to loan accretion and amortization. We currently project $462,000 of remaining discount accretion to be recognized in income related to the FDIC acquisitions over the next year, and $2.6 million of discount accretion related to the acquisition of CBS over the remaining lives of the acquired loans. During such period, if we are unable to replace our acquired loans and the related accretion with new performing loans at a similar yield and other interest earning assets due to such reasons as a decline in loan demand or competition from other financial institutions in our markets, our financial condition and earnings, including our interest rate spread, may be adversely affected.\nOur commercial real estate, real estate construction, and commercial business loans increase our exposure to credit risks.\nOver the last several years, we have increased our non-residential lending in order to improve the yield and reduce the average duration of our assets. At September 30, 2016, our portfolio of commercial real estate, real estate construction, and commercial business loans totaled $747.5 million, or 74.3% of total loans, compared to $277.2 million, or 63.3% of total loans at September 30, 2008. At September 30, 2016, the amount of nonperforming commercial real estate, real estate construction, and commercial business loans was $2.8 million, or 75.1% of total nonperforming loans. At September 30, 2016, our largest non-residential real estate borrowing relationship had a loan balance of $12.6 million and a potential liability of $19.9 million, and consisted of a borrower whose collateral was multiple one- to four-family residential real estate construction loans. These loans may expose us to a greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential real estate loans because, in the case of commercial loans, repayment often depends on the successful operation and earnings of the borrower's businesses and, in the case of consumer loans, the applicable collateral is subject to rapid depreciation. Additionally, commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. If loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest due on the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIf our problem assets increase, our earnings will decrease.\nAt September 30, 2016, our nonperforming assets (which consist of nonaccrual loans, loans 90 days or more delinquent, and foreclosed real estate assets) consisted of $3.7 million of loans and $2.7 million of OREO. Excluded from the nonperforming loans at September 30, 2016 is an additional $4.8 million of acquired loans that are regarded as accruing loans due to the ongoing recognition of accretion income established at the time of acquisition. In addition, our classified assets (consisting of substandard loans and securities, doubtful loans and loss assets) totaled $40.1 million at September 30, 2016. Our problem assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or OREO. Based on our estimate of the level of allowance for loan losses required, we record a provision for loan losses as a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level. From time to time, we also write down the value of properties in our OREO portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our OREO. Further, the resolution of problem assets requires the active involvement of management, which could detract from the overall supervision of our operations. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly.\nAcquisitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe Company has been highly acquisitive in recent years, completing the three FDIC-assisted transactions between 2009 and 2011, and the CBS acquisition. We expect to continue to grow by acquiring other financial institutions, related businesses or branches of other financial institutions that we believe provide a strategic fit with our business. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we may not be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. In addition, such acquisitions may involve the issuance of securities, which may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share. Acquiring banks, bank branches or businesses involves risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:\n\u2022\nPotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities we acquire;\n\u2022\nExposure to potential asset quality problems of the acquired financial institutions, businesses or branches;\n\u2022\nDifficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of financial institutions, businesses or branches we acquire;\n\u2022\nHigher than expected deposit attrition;\n\u2022\nPotential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nThe possible loss of key employees and customers of financial institutions, businesses or branches we acquire;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in safely investing any cash generated by the acquisition;\n\u2022\nInability to utilize potential tax benefits from such transactions;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in estimating the fair value of the financial institutions, businesses or branches to be acquired which affects the profits we generate from the acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nPotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the financial institutions or businesses to be acquired.\nReductions in service charge income could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe derive significant revenue from service charges on deposit accounts, the bulk of which comes from overdraft-related fees. Changes in banking regulations, such as the FRB\u2019s rules on certain overdraft payments on consumer accounts, as well as the FDIC\u2019s Overdraft Payment Programs and Consumer Protection Final Overdraft Payment Supervisory Guidance, could have an adverse impact on our ability to derive income from service charges. Increased competition from other financial institutions or changes in consumer behavior could lead to declines in our deposit balances, which would result in a decline in service charge fees. Such a reduction could have a material impact on our earnings.\nReductions in interchange income could negatively impact our earnings.\nInterchange income is derived from fees paid by merchants to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the network's infrastructure and payment facilitation. These fees are paid to card issuers to compensate them for the costs associated with issuance and operation. We earn interchange fees on card transactions from its debit cards, including $5.0 million during the year ended September 30, 2016. Merchants have attempted to negotiate lower interchange rates, and the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act limits the amount of interchange fees that may be charged for certain debit card transactions. Merchants may also continue to pursue alternative payment platforms, such as Apple Pay, to lower their processing costs. Any such new payment system may reduce our interchange income. Our failure to comply with the operating regulations set forth by payment card networks, which may change, could subject us to penalties, fees or the termination of our license to use the networks. Any of these scenarios could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe derive the most significant portion of our revenues from our lending activities. When we lend money, commit to lend money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk, which is the risk of losses if our customers do not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral, if any, securing the payment of these loans is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We may experience significant loan losses, which may have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. If our assumptions are incorrect, the allowance for loan losses - which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses and represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans - may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Consequently, this would require additions to the allowance for loan losses. Additions to the allowance would decrease our net income and capital. At September 30, 2016, our allowance for loan losses was $10.4 million, or 1.03% of total loans and 277.66% of nonperforming loans, compared to $9.5 million, or 1.30% of loans and 229.85% of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, we had $3.7 million of total nonperforming loans.\nOur level of commercial real estate, real estate construction and commercial business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating the allowance for loan losses. These loans may require increased provisions for loan losses in the future, which would decrease our earnings.\nBecause the risk rating of the loans is dependent on some subjective information and subject to changes in the borrower\u2019s credit risk profile, evolving local market conditions and other factors, it can be difficult for us to predict the effects of such factors on the classifications assigned to the loan portfolio, and thus difficult to anticipate the velocity or volume of the migration of loans through the classification process and effect on the level of the allowance for loan losses. Future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the economic environment as well as changes in assumptions regarding a borrower\u2019s ability to pay and/or collateral values. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination procedures, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, such agencies may require an increase to the provision for loan losses or further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs would decrease our earnings and adversely affect our capital, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a community bank, our recruitment and retention efforts may not be sufficient enough to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations.\nOur financial success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly motivated, well-qualified personnel. We face significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees from financial institutions and others. As we continue to grow, we may find our recruitment and retention efforts more challenging. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating experienced or qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy, and we may be required to substantially increase our overall compensation or benefits to attract and retain such employees. Furthermore, in June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the FDIC jointly issued comprehensive final guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging employees to take imprudent risks. This regulation significantly restricts the amount, form, and context in which we pay incentive-based compensation and may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to non-financial institutions in terms of attracting and retaining senior level employees.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nOur reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe hold certain intangible assets that in the future could be classified as either partially or fully impaired, which would reduce our earnings and the book values of these assets.\nPursuant to applicable accounting requirements, we are required to periodically test our goodwill and core deposit intangible assets for impairment. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common shares, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. Future impairment testing may result in a partial or full impairment of the value of our goodwill or core deposit intangible assets, or both. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.\nWe rely on third-party vendors for key components of our business.\nMany key components of our operations, including data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online interfaces and services, internet connections and network access are provided by other companies. Our vendor management process selects third-party vendors carefully, but we do not control their actions. Problems, including disruptions in communication, security breaches, or failure of a vendor to provide services, could hurt our operations or our relationships with customers. If our vendors suffer financial or operational issues, our operations and reputation could suffer if it harms the vendors\u2019 ability to serve us and our customers. Third-party vendors are also a source of operational and information security risk to us. Replacing or renegotiating contracts with vendors could entail significant operational expense and delays. The use of third-party vendors represents an unavoidable inherent risk to our company.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events would negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur market area is located in the southeastern region of the United States and is susceptible to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, other severe weather events and related flooding and wind damage, and man-made disasters. These natural disasters could negatively impact regional economic conditions, cause a decline in the value or destruction of mortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures or loss on loans originated by us, damage our banking facilities and offices and negatively impact our growth strategy. Such weather events can disrupt operations, result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economies in the markets where they operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future hurricanes or tornadoes will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas, but such weather events could negatively impact economic conditions in these regions and result in a decline in local loan demand and loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in delinquencies, foreclosures or loan losses. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of natural or man-made disasters.\nIndustry Risks\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Because our interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, a sustained increase in interest rates generally would tend to reduce our interest income.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. Also, increases in interest rates may extend the life of fixed-rate assets, which would restrict our ability to reinvest in higher yielding alternatives, and may result in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early so long as the early withdrawal penalty is less than the interest they could receive on a new investment.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the current fair value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2016, the fair value of our portfolio of investment securities, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations totaled $206.3 million. Net unrealized gains on these securities totaled $1.7 million at September 30, 2016.\nAdditionally, 59.7% of our one- to four-family loan portfolio is comprised of adjustable-rate loans. Any rise in market interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable-rate mortgage loans, which would increase the possibility of default.\nStrong competition and changing banking environment may limit growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere, and non-traditional financial institutions, including non-depository financial services providers. Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Additionally, non-traditional financial institutions may not have the same regulatory requirements or burdens as we do even while playing a rapidly increasing role in the financial services industry including providing services previously limited to commercial banks, which could ultimately limit our growth, profitability and shareholder value. Our profitability depends upon our ability to successfully compete in our market areas and adapt to the ever changing banking environment.\nOur business may be adversely affected by downturns in our national and local economies.\nOur operations are significantly affected by national and local economic conditions. Substantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in Georgia, east-central Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. All of our branches and most of our deposit customers are also located in these areas. A decline in the economies in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our loans, deposits and services may decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nweak economic conditions may continue to limit the demand for loans by creditworthy borrowers, limiting our capacity to leverage our retail deposits and maintain our net interest income;\n\u2022\ncollateral for our loans may decline further in value; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of our low-cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease.\nAs an issuer of debit cards, we are exposed to losses in the event that holders of our cards experience fraud on their card accounts.\nOur customers regularly use CharterBank-issued debit cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other businesses. There is the risk of data security breaches at these retailers and other businesses that could result in the misappropriation of our customers\u2019\ndebit card information. When our customers use CharterBank-issued cards to make purchases from those businesses, card account information is provided to the business. If the business\u2019s systems that process or store card account information are subject to a data security breach, holders of our cards who have made purchases from that business may experience fraud on their card accounts. The Bank may suffer losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers\u2019 card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.\nWe are exposed to many types of operation risks, including reputational risk, legal and regulatory and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or persons outside our company, including the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by the Bank can result in negative public opinion about our business. Negative public opinion could also affect our credit ratings, which are important to our access to unsecured wholesale borrowings.\nOur business involves storing and processing sensitive consumer and business customer data. If personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who were not permitted to have that information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. Furthermore, a cyber security breach could result in theft of such data.\nBecause we operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions, and our large transaction volume, may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers, computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions or electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters, disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets) which may result in violations of consumer privacy laws including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, cause significant liability to us and give reason for existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage and potential liability, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and to the risk that our (or our vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business (for example, by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect), as well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operations results, perhaps materially.\nThe financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes, and if we are unable to stay current with those changes, we will not be able to effectively compete.\nThe financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to keep pace with the technological changes and to use technology to satisfy and grow customer demand for our products and services and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We expect that we will need to make substantial investments in our technology and information systems to compete effectively and to stay current with technological changes. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and will be able to invest more heavily in developing and adopting new technologies, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory Risks\nRegulation of the financial services industry continues to undergo major changes, and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act brought about a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, mortgage lending practices, registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies.\nAmong other things, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act:\n\u2022\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency became the primary federal regulator for federal savings banks such as the Bank (replacing the Office of Thrift Supervision), and the FRB now supervises and regulates all savings and loan holding companies that were formerly regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision, including the Company;\n\u2022\nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was established, and has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like the Bank, will be examined by their applicable bank regulators;\n\u2022\nfederal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings banks have been weakened, and state attorneys general have the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws;\n\u2022\nthe federal prohibition on paying interest on demand deposits has been eliminated, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts. This change may increase our interest expense;\n\u2022\nthe FRB was required to set minimum capital levels for depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for their insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital are required to be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions;\n\u2022\nthere are prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund (the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d);\n\u2022\nthe assessment base for deposit insurance premiums was expanded; and\n\u2022\nthere are new restrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses.\nSome of these and other major changes could materially impact the profitability of our business, the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans, require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, enforcement actions and reputational risk. Many of these provisions became effective upon enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, while others were subject to further study, rulemaking, and the discretion of regulatory bodies and have only recently taken effect or will take effect in coming years. In light of these significant changes and the discretion afforded to federal regulators, we cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act or any implementing regulations will have on the Company\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s businesses or our ability to pursue future business opportunities, our financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain other reform proposals have resulted in the Company and the Bank becoming subject to stricter capital requirements and leverage limits, and affect the scope, coverage, or calculation of capital, all of which could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors. See \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business - Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors\u201d of this Report for further information. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015, and refined the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also established a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and resulted in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations established a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for the Bank and the Company could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions such as the inability to pay dividends or repurchase shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nNew regulations could restrict our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u2022\nexcessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u2022\ninterest-only payments;\n\u2022\nnegative-amortization; and\n\u2022\nterms longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive/and or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.\nGovernment responses to economic conditions may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has changed the bank regulatory framework, created an independent consumer protection bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, and established more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies. Bank regulatory agencies also have been responding aggressively to concerns and adverse trends identified in examinations. Ongoing uncertainty and adverse developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets, and the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulatory actions, may adversely affect our operations by increasing ongoing compliance costs and restricting our business activities, including our ability to originate or sell loans, modify loan terms, or foreclose on property securing loans. These risks could affect the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which also would negatively affect our financial performance.\nIf the FRB increases the federal funds rate, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income.\nBank regulatory agencies, such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC, govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors, and not for the protection or benefit of potential investors. In addition, new laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs of regulatory compliance and costs of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations. New laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, the fees we can charge, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. For example, regulatory changes to our overdraft protection programs could decrease the amount of fees we receive for these services. For the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, overdraft protection fees totaled $5.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively. We cannot fully predict the effect that changes in law or regulation will have on the Company\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s businesses or our ability to pursue future business opportunities, our financial condition or results of operations.\nInvestment/Securities Risks\nOur management team\u2019s strategies for the enhancement of shareholder value may not succeed.\nOur management team is taking actions to enhance shareholder value, including reviewing personnel, developing new products, engaging in stock repurchases, issuing dividends and exploring acquisition opportunities. In addition, we intend to focus on opportunities for cross selling products to existing customers in an effort to deepen our \u201cshare of wallet.\u201d These actions may not enhance shareholder value. For example, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have, since 2013, paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of our common stock, we are not legally required to do so. Further, the Federal Reserve could decide at any time that paying any dividends on our common stock could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The reduction or elimination of dividends paid on our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile due to limited trading volume.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. However, the average daily trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock has been relatively small, averaging less than 41,000 shares per day during 2016. As a result, trades involving a relatively small number of shares may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock, and it may be difficult for investors to acquire or dispose of large blocks of stock without significantly affecting the market price.", "PERMNO": 89168, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "CHFN"}
