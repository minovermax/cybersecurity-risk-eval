Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to known and unknown risks. As a result, past financial performance and historical trends may not be reliable indicators of our future performance.\nMacroeconomic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related responsive actions have adversely affected our financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow, and may continue to do so in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of many of our events and the temporary closure of substantially all of our attractions, hotels, and other operations. The substantial reduction in our operations resulted in significant losses and negative cash flow from operations in 2020 and 2021.\nCOVID-19 has been and continues to be a complex and evolving situation, with governments, public institutions, and other organizations imposing or recommending, and businesses and individuals implementing, at various times and to varying degrees, restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation; limitations on the size of in-person gatherings; closures of, or occupancy or other operating limitations on, work facilities, lodging facilities, food and beverage establishments, schools, public buildings, and businesses; cancellation of events, including exhibitions, sporting events, conferences and meetings; and quarantines and lock-downs. COVID-19 and its consequences also dramatically reduced travel and demand for travel related services, which has and may continue to impact our business, operations, and financial results. Although many of these restrictions, bans, limitations, closures and mandates have eased or been lifted, they have been reinstituted from time to time in varying degrees by various jurisdictions as resurgences and variants such as Delta and Omicron have emerged and then subsided. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, operations, and financial results will depend on the factors described above and numerous other evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of COVID-19; the availability and distribution of effective vaccines or treatments; COVID-19\u2019s impact on global and regional economies and economic activity, its short and longer-term impact on the demand for travel, transient and group business, and levels of consumer confidence; and how quickly economies, travel activity, and demand for lodging recovers after the pandemic subsides.\nOur GES business depends on exhibitions, conferences, and other live events and the size of marketing expenditures relating to those events. Existing or future government orders prohibiting large group gatherings would significantly and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Even though exhibitions and live events have increased as compared to 2020, we have experienced and continue to experience reduced spending for our services related to reduced marketing budgets. Additionally, when exhibitions and live events have occurred, we have experienced reduced attendance as compared to exhibitions and live events that occurred pre-pandemic.\nFurther, the current circumstances are dynamic and the impacts of COVID-19 on our business operations, including the duration and impact on overall customer demand, are ongoing and uncertain (for example, since travel restrictions have been lifted, some guests have chosen to not travel or visit attractions and hospitality operations within our Pursuit business as a result of health concerns, which adversely affects our profitability and cash flow). Future revenue from our Pursuit operations will depend on any further spread of the virus, or variants of the virus, our ability to keep our operations open, the willingness of people to travel to our locations, and the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations, which decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions. Both our Pursuit and GES businesses have also experienced increased costs in order to supply our customers or guests with personal protection equipment, to conduct comprehensive cleaning regimens, and in taking other measures that we have determined are in the best interests of our employees, customers, guests, and/or event participants. The potential adverse COVID-19 impacts to our businesses could have a correspondingly negative effect on our overall liquidity. Our new senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity of $75 million under the revolving credit facility through June 2022, with liquidity defined as unrestricted cash and available capacity on our revolving credit facility, and financial covenants tested beginning September 30, 2022. If we are unable to maintain compliance with these covenants, our lenders may exercise remedies against us, including the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness on our revolving credit facility. A prolonged recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic or a resurgence in cases of COVID-19 could further materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur businesses will face new challenges presented by the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct economic impacts of the pandemic, it is clear that as our businesses have begun to recover, they are operating in new environments in light of societal, regulatory, and industry changes that have occurred since March 2020. Our ability to continue to adjust to these changes and deliver expected business results may be hampered by ongoing uncertainty presented by the pandemic in terms of proper safety protocols, social norms, and a potential of uneven demand for our services. In addition, our ability to deliver such services and otherwise execute against our recovery and growth strategies may be impacted by the extreme reduction of our workforce over the past two years and the resulting loss of knowledge of and experience in our businesses. Moreover, our go-forward strategy includes a heightened use of temporary employees in the delivery of our services, and while those employees will likely include those who were previously employed by us on a full-time basis, the level of execution may not be consistent with previous performance. Taken together, our ability to anticipate and adjust to these ongoing changes and new conditions may lead to additional costs, which may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are vulnerable to deterioration in general economic conditions. Our business is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions in the United States and other global markets in which we operate, including as a result of the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of our GES business largely depends on the number of exhibitions or other live events held, the size of marketing expenditures at those events, and on the strength of particular industries that support those events. The number and size of exhibitions generally decrease when the economy weakens, which our business has experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also could suffer from reduced spending for our services because many live event marketing budgets are partly discretionary and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced when economic conditions deteriorate. In addition, revenue from our Pursuit operations depends largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations, which decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions. As a result, any deterioration in general economic conditions could further materially and adversely affect our business, product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTravel industry disruptions, particularly those affecting the hotel and airline industries, could adversely affect our business. Our business depends largely on the ability and willingness of people, whether exhibitors, event attendees, tourists, or others, to travel. Factors adversely affecting the travel industry, and particularly the airline and hotel industries, generally also adversely affect our business and results of operations. Factors that could adversely affect the travel industry include high or rising fuel prices, increased security and passport requirements, weather conditions, health epidemics, pandemics and endemics, airline accidents, acts of terrorism, and international political instability and hostilities. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing orders resulted in severe global travel restrictions, reduction in capacity of event venues, hotels, attractions and other operations, and reluctance of customers to travel. These circumstances had severe effects on our businesses. The occurrence of additional disruptions, a prolonged recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic or a spike or resurgence in cases of COVID-19, or other unexpected events that affect the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations, could further materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTransportation disruptions and increases in transportation costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations. GES relies on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibition, warehouse, and customer facilities. If our customers and suppliers are unable to secure the services of those independent transportation carriers at favorable rates, it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, disruption of transportation services due to\nweather-related problems; labor strikes; lockouts; shortage of supply chain labor, including CDL truck drivers; shipping capacity constraints, including shortages of related equipment; or other events could adversely affect our ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, weather conditions, accidents, and other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business. The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes, fires, floods, and earthquakes), acts of war or terrorism, accidents involving our travel offerings or experiences, the effects of climate change, including any impact of global warming, or the prospect of these events could disrupt our business. Changes in climates may increase the frequency and intensity of adverse weather patterns and make certain destinations less desirable.\nSuch catastrophic events have, and could have, an adverse impact on Pursuit, which is heavily dependent on the ability and willingness of its guests to travel and/or visit our attractions. Pursuit guests tend to delay or postpone vacations if natural conditions differ from those that typically prevail at competing lodges, resorts, and attractions, and catastrophic events and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to such events could impede the guests\u2019 ability to travel, and interrupt our business operations, including damaging our properties. For example, the accident on July 18, 2020, at Pursuit\u2019s Glacier Adventure attraction, which involved one of our off-road Ice Explorers and resulted in three fatalities and other serious injuries, may have a negative impact on our reputation and traveler willingness to visit that attraction in the future.\nSuch catastrophic events could also have a negative impact on GES, causing a cancellation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues or disrupt the services we provide to our customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels, and other public venues. Such events could also have a negative impact on GES\u2019 production facilities, preventing us from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers. In addition, unfavorable media attention, or negative publicity, in the wake of any catastrophic event or accident could damage our reputation or reduce the demand for our services. If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, they could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nStrategic, Business, and Operational Risks\nThe seasonality of our business makes us particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods. The peak activity for our Pursuit business is during the summer months, as the vast majority of Pursuit\u2019s revenue is earned in the second and third quarters. Our GES exhibition and event activity varies significantly because it is based on the frequency and timing of shows, many of which are not held each year, and which may shift between quarters. If adverse events or conditions occur during these peak periods, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or natural disasters such as forest fires, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nNew capital projects may not be commercially successful. From time to time, we pursue capital projects, such as our current development of FlyOver Chicago and FlyOver Canada Toronto, and other efforts to upgrade some of our Pursuit offerings, in order to enhance and expand our business. Capital projects are subject to a number of risks, including unanticipated delays, cost overruns, and the failure to achieve established financial and strategic goals, as well as additional project-specific risks. For example, we had to delay FlyOver Canada Toronto due to poor market conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and a need to preserve capital. Although FlyOver Canada Toronto\u2019s opening is planned for 2024, this attraction may be further delayed by market conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other poor conditions. A prolonged delay in these capital projects, or our failure to accurately predict the revenue or profit that will be generated from these projects, could prevent them from performing in accordance with our commercial expectations and could materially and adversely affect our future success, business, and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries. Competition in the live events markets is driven by price and service quality, among other factors. To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies, we may be required to lower our prices and rates to avoid the loss of related business. Moreover, customer consolidations and other actions within the industry have caused downward pricing pressure for our products and services and could affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our customers. If we are unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as our competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, we could lose market share. Our inability to meet the challenges presented by the competitive and dynamic environment of our industry could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on our large exhibition event clients to renew their service contracts and on our exclusive right to provide those services. GES has a number of large exhibition event organizers and large customer accounts. If any of these large clients do not renew their service contracts, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nMoreover, when event organizers hire GES as the official services contractor, they usually also grant GES an exclusive right to perform material handling, electrical, rigging, and other services at the exhibition facility. However, some exhibition facilities have taken certain steps to in-source certain event services (either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider) as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry, such as an increased supply of or reduced demand for exhibition space. If exhibition facilities choose to in-source certain event services, GES will lose the ability to provide certain event services, and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nShow rotation affects our profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult. GES results are largely dependent upon the frequency, timing, and location of exhibitions and events. Some large exhibitions are not held annually (they may be held once every two, three, or four years) or may be held at different times of the year from when they were previously held. In addition, the same exhibition may change locations from year to year resulting in lower margins if the exhibition shifts to a higher-cost location. Any of these factors could cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, making periodic comparisons difficult.\nCompleted acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned. We regularly evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire businesses that complement, enhance, or expand our current business, or offer growth opportunities. Our acquired businesses might not meet our financial and non-financial expectations or yield anticipated benefits. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to conform controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and retain the acquired business\u2019s key personnel and customers. Moreover, our acquisition activity may subject us to new regulatory requirements, distract our senior management and employees, and expose us to unknown liabilities or contingencies that we may fail to identify prior to closing. If we are forced to make changes to our business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect our business operations, such as the impact of COVID-19, we may be required to record additional future impairment charges, as we did in 2020. Additionally, we may borrow funds to finance strategic acquisitions. Debt leverage resulting from future acquisitions would reduce our debt capacity, increase our interest expense, and limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities. Such borrowings may also be subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, product and service sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations. We have operations outside of the United States primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Germany. During 2021 and 2020, our international operations accounted for approximately 38% and 30% of our consolidated revenue, respectively, and 19% and 36% of our segment operating loss, respectively. Consequently, a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. We do not currently hedge equity risk arising from the translation of non-United States denominated assets and liabilities. Our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the currency translation are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also have certain loans in currencies other than the entity\u2019s functional currency, which results in gains or losses as exchange rates fluctuate. As a result, significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates could result in material changes to the net equity position we report in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nLiabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect our results of operations. We and our predecessors have a corporate history spanning decades and involving diverse businesses. Some of those businesses owned properties and used raw materials that have been, and may continue to be, subject to litigation. Moreover, some of the raw materials used and the waste produced by those businesses have been and are the subject of United States federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts. In addition, we may incur other liabilities resulting from indemnification claims involving previously sold properties and subsidiaries, or obligations under defined benefit plans or other employee plans, as well as claims from past operations of predecessors or their subsidiaries. Although we believe we have adequate reserves and sufficient insurance coverage to cover those potential liabilities, future events or proceedings could render our reserves or insurance protections inadequate, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLabor and Employment Risks\nOur business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover, and labor cost increases. We rely heavily on our global workforce, including many seasonal and temporary employees. Several factors, including factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted and may continue to result in labor shortages, turnover, and increased labor costs, including high employment levels and demand for employees; unemployment subsidies; the freezing of visa programs; increased wages offered by other employers; vaccine mandates and other government regulations and our responses thereto. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our ability to hire qualified team members and, therefore negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nOur business is relationship driven. Our GES business is heavily focused on client relationships, and, specifically, on having close collaboration and interaction with our clients. To be successful, our account teams must be able to understand clients\u2019 desires and expectations in order to provide top-quality service. If we are unable to maintain our client relationships, including due to the loss of key members of our account teams, we could also lose customers and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nUnion-represented labor increases our risk of higher labor costs and work stoppages. Significant portions of our employees are unionized. We have approximately 100 collective bargaining agreements, and we are required to renegotiate approximately one-third of those each year. If we increase wages or benefits as a result of labor negotiations, either our operating margins will suffer, or we could\nincrease the cost of our services to our customers, which could lead those customers to turn to other vendors with lower prices. Either event could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective bargaining process, the union may strike or carry out other types of work stoppages. If this were to occur, we might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skills to perform many of the services, or we may incur additional costs to do so, both of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur participation in multi-employer pension plans could substantially increase our pension costs. We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for our United States and Canada-based employees. In addition, we are obligated to contribute to multi-employer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements covering our union-represented employees. We contributed $7.1 million in 2021, $8.6 million in 2020, and $27.3 million in 2019 to those multi-employer pension plans. Third-party boards of trustees manage these multi-employer plans. Based upon the information we receive from plan administrators, we believe that several of those multi-employer plans are underfunded. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires us to reduce the underfunded status over defined time periods. Moreover, we would be required to make additional payments of our proportionate share of a plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities if a plan terminates, or other contributing employers withdraw, due to insolvency or other reasons, or if we voluntarily withdraw from a plan. In 2019, we withdrew from the underfunded Central States Pension Plan and accordingly, we recorded a charge of $15.5 million, which represented the estimated present value of future contributions we will be required to make as a result of the union\u2019s withdrawal. At this time, we do not anticipate triggering any significant withdrawal from any other multi-employer pension plan to which we currently contribute. However, significant plan contribution increases could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Refer to Note 18 - Pension and Postretirement Benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Form 10-K) for further information.\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy Risks\nWe are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and threats. Our devices, servers, cloud-based solutions, computer systems, and business systems are vulnerable to cybersecurity risk, including cyberattacks, or we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information and company assets. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our employees switched to working remotely, which magnifies the importance of integrity of our remote access security measures. Despite our efforts to protect ourselves with insurance, and create security barriers to such threats, including regularly reviewing our systems for vulnerabilities and continually updating our protections, we might not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. Our failure to effectively prevent, detect, and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of information security threats could lead to business interruptions, delays or loss of critical data, misuse, modification, or destruction of information, including trade secrets and confidential business information, reputational damage, and third-party claims, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, the cost of protecting against cybersecurity attacks and threats is expensive and expected to increase going forward.\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data are evolving and could result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines. We store and process the personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, and third parties with whom we have business relationships. The legal requirements restricting the way we store, collect, handle, and transfer personal data continue to evolve, and there are an increasing number of authorities issuing privacy laws and regulations. These data privacy laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations, creating uncertainty and inconsistency across jurisdictions. Our compliance with these myriad requirements could involve making changes in our services, business practices, or internal systems, any of which could increase our costs, lower revenue, or reduce efficiency. Our failure to comply with existing or new rules could result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, litigation, adverse publicity, or could cause our customers to lose trust in our services. In addition, if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations, or suffer a security breach, those violations could also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations. In addition, the costs of maintaining adequate protection, including insurance protection against such threats, as they develop in the future (or as legal requirements related to data security increase) are expected to increase and could be material. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 19721, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "VVI"}
