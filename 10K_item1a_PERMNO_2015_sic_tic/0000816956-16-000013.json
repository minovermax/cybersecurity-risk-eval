{"cik": "816956", "company": "CONMED CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities, including our common stock, involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the specific factors set forth below as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. See \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d.\nOur financial performance is dependent on conditions in the healthcare industry and the broader economy.\nThe results of our business are directly tied to the economic conditions in the healthcare industry and the broader economy as a whole. We will continue to monitor and manage the impact of the overall economic environment on the Company. Approximately 21% of our revenues are derived from the sale of capital products. The sales of such products are negatively impacted if hospitals and other healthcare providers are unable to secure the financing necessary to purchase these products or otherwise defer purchases.\nOur significant international operations subject us to foreign currency fluctuations and other risks associated with operating in foreign countries.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from foreign sales. Approximately 50% of our total 2015 consolidated net sales were to customers outside the United States. We have sales subsidiaries in a significant number of countries in Europe as well as Australia, Canada, China and Korea. In those countries in which we have a direct presence, our sales are denominated in the local\ncurrency and those sales denominated in local currency amounted to approximately 34% of our total net sales in 2015. The remaining 16% of sales to customers outside the United States was on an export basis and transacted in United States dollars.\nBecause a significant portion of our operations consist of sales activities in foreign jurisdictions, our financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the markets in which we distribute products. While we have implemented a hedging strategy involving foreign currency forward contracts for 2015, our revenues and earnings are only partially protected from foreign currency translation if the United States dollar strengthens as compared with currencies such as the Euro. Further, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts beyond 2017. Our international presence exposes us to certain other inherent risks, including:\n\u2022\nimposition of limitations on conversions of foreign currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by international subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nimposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers;\n\u2022\npolitical risks, including political instability;\n\u2022\nreliance on third parties to distribute our products;\n\u2022\nhyperinflation in certain foreign countries; and\n\u2022\nimposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments.\nWe cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur financial performance is subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy, including the effects of increased borrowing and integration of newly acquired businesses or product lines.\nA key element of our business strategy has been to expand through acquisitions and we may seek to pursue additional acquisitions in the future. Our success is dependent in part upon our ability to integrate acquired companies or product lines into our existing operations. For example, we completed the acquisition of SurgiQuest, Inc. (\u201cSurgiQuest\u201d) on January 4, 2016 and are in the process of integrating SurgiQuest into our business. We may not have sufficient management and other resources to accomplish the integration of our past and future acquisitions and implementing our acquisition strategy may strain our relationship with customers, suppliers, distributors, personnel or others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and make acquisitions on acceptable terms or that we will be able to obtain financing for such acquisitions on acceptable terms. In addition, while we are generally entitled to customary indemnification from sellers of businesses for any difficulties that may have arisen prior to our acquisition of each business, acquisitions may involve exposure to unknown liabilities and the amount and time for claiming under these indemnification provisions is often limited. As a result, our financial performance is now, and will continue to be, subject to various risks associated with the acquisition of businesses, including the financial effects associated with any increased borrowing required to fund such acquisitions or with the integration of such businesses. We incurred substantial additional debt in connection with the SurgiQuest acquisition, and we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully integrate and advance SurgiQuest\u2019s product lines or that risks related to the SurgiQuest acquisition will not negatively impact our financial performance.\nOur financial performance may be adversely impacted by healthcare reform legislation.\nProvisions of healthcare legislation, including provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, could meaningfully change the way health care is developed and delivered and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs of Medicare, governing comparative effectiveness research, and implementing an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies. That legislation also included a 2.3% excise tax imposed upon sales within the U.S. of certain medical device products, which has recently been delayed until 2018. We cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or internationally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements or otherwise causing pricing pressures to hospitals for surgical procedures or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in recalls, fines or materially adverse implications.\nSubstantially all of our products are classified as class II medical devices subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the FDA and comparable foreign counterparts. As a manufacturer of medical devices, our manufacturing processes and facilities are subject to on-site inspection and continuing review by the FDA for compliance with the Quality System Regulations. We received a warning letter from the FDA related to our Centennial, CO facility on January 30, 2014. Accordingly, we undertook corrective actions. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the FDA again inspected our Centennial, CO manufacturing\nfacility and, on November 18, 2014, issued a Form 483 with eight observations, three of which the FDA characterized as repeat observations. On December 10, 2014, we responded to the Form 483 Observations. We have received some additional questions from the FDA and responded to these questions on April 25, 2015. The remediation costs to date have not been material, although there can be no assurance that responding to the Form 483 observations or a future inspection by the FDA will not result in an additional Form 483 or warning letter, or other regulatory actions, which may include consent decrees or fines. Manufacturing and sales of our products outside the United States are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements which vary from country to country. Moreover, we are generally required to obtain regulatory clearance or approval prior to marketing a new product. The time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for foreign approvals may differ from FDA requirements. Failure to comply with applicable domestic and/or foreign regulatory requirements may result in:\n\u2022\nfines or other enforcement actions;\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of products;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022\nloss of certification;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of existing product approvals or clearances;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve or clear new applications or notices;\n\u2022\nincreased quality control costs; or\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nFailure to comply with Quality System Regulations and applicable foreign regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are not able to manufacture products in compliance with regulatory standards, we may decide to cease manufacturing of those products and may be subject to product recall.\nIn addition to the Quality System Regulations, many of our products are also subject to industry-defined standards. We may not be able to comply with these regulations and standards due to deficiencies in component parts or our manufacturing processes. If we are not able to comply with the Quality System Regulations or industry-defined standards, we may not be able to fill customer orders and we may decide to cease production of non-compliant products. Failure to produce products could affect our profit margins and could lead to loss of customers.\nOur products are subject to product recall and we have conducted product recalls in the past. Although no recall has had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, we cannot assure you that regulatory issues will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future or that product recalls will not harm our reputation and our customer relationships.\nThe highly competitive market for our products may create adverse pricing pressures.\nThe market for our products is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives of supply. Many of our competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we compete, which may make such competitors more attractive to surgeons, hospitals, group purchasing organizations and others. In addition, many of our competitors are large, technically competent firms with substantial assets. Competitive pricing pressures or the introduction of new products by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our revenues. See \u201cProducts\u201d in Item 1 - Business for a further discussion of these competitive forces.\nFactors which may influence our customers\u2019 choice of competitor products include:\n\u2022changes in surgeon preferences;\n\u2022increases or decreases in healthcare spending related to medical devices;\n\u2022our inability to supply products to them as a result of product recall, market withdrawal or back-order;\n\u2022the introduction by competitors of new products or new features to existing products;\n\u2022the introduction by competitors of alternative surgical technology; and\n\u2022advances in surgical procedures, discoveries or developments in the healthcare industry.\nWe use a variety of raw materials in our businesses, and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products.\nOur reliance on certain suppliers and commodity markets to secure raw materials used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of raw materials. In some instances, we participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nCost reduction efforts in the healthcare industry could put pressures on our prices and margins.\nIn recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs. Such efforts include national healthcare reform, trends towards managed care, cuts in Medicare, consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by GPOs and IDNs. Demand and prices for our products may be adversely affected by such trends.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological change or to successfully develop new products with wide market acceptance, which could cause us to lose business to competitors.\nThe market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology. Our future financial performance will depend in part on our ability to develop and manufacture new products on a cost-effective basis, to introduce them to the market on a timely basis and to have them accepted by surgeons.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technology or to develop viable new products. In addition, many of our competitors are substantially larger with greater financial resources which may allow them to more rapidly develop new products. Factors which may result in delays of new product introductions or cancellation of our plans to manufacture and market new products include:\n\u2022\ncapital constraints;\n\u2022\nresearch and development delays;\n\u2022\ndelays in securing regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive landscape, including the emergence of alternative products or solutions which reduce or eliminate the markets for pending products.\nOur new products may fail to achieve expected levels of market acceptance.\nNew product introductions may fail to achieve market acceptance. The degree of market acceptance for any of our products will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in the time frames we currently estimate;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully implement new technologies;\n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s readiness to accept new products;\n\u2022\nhaving adequate financial and technological resources for future product development and promotion;\n\u2022\nthe efficacy of our products; and\n\u2022\nthe prices of our products compared to the prices of our competitors\u2019 products.\nIf our new products do not achieve market acceptance, we may be unable to recover our investments and may lose business to competitors.\nIn addition, some of the companies with which we now compete, or may compete in the future, have or may have more extensive research, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater technical and personnel resources than we do, and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry. See \u201cProducts\u201d in Item 1 - Business for a further discussion of these competitive forces.\nOur senior credit agreement contains covenants which may limit our flexibility or prevent us from taking actions.\nOur senior credit agreement contains, and future credit facilities are expected to contain, certain restrictive covenants which will affect, and in many respects significantly limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022incur indebtedness;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\u2022sell assets; and\n\u2022pursue acquisitions.\nThese covenants, unless waived, may prevent us from pursuing acquisitions, significantly limit our operating and financial flexibility and limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities. Our ability to comply with such provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. In the event of any default under our credit agreement, the credit agreement lenders may elect to declare all amounts borrowed under our credit agreement, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. If we were unable to repay such borrowings, the credit agreement lenders could proceed against collateral securing the credit agreement which consists of substantially all of our property and assets. Our credit agreement also contains a material adverse effect clause which may limit our ability to access additional funding under our credit agreement should a material adverse change in our business occur.\nOur leverage and debt service requirements may require us to adopt alternative business strategies.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $270.8 million of debt outstanding, representing 25% of total capitalization. On January 4, 2016, we entered into our fifth amended and restated senior credit agreement consisting of: (a) a $175.0 million term loan facility and (b) a $525.0 million revolving credit facility. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to investors, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\na portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other purposes;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be limited or impaired or may be at higher interest rates;\n\u2022\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage when compared to competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u2022\nwe may be hindered in our ability to adjust rapidly to market conditions;\n\u2022\nour degree of leverage could make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or other adverse circumstances applicable to us; and\n\u2022\nour interest expense could increase if interest rates in general increase because a portion of our borrowings, including our borrowings under our credit agreement, are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, which could require us to reduce our expenditures, sell assets, restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital.\nOur ability to satisfy our obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may not have sufficient cash flow available to enable us to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as foregoing acquisitions, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these strategies could be implemented on terms acceptable to us, if at all. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a discussion of our indebtedness and its implications.\nWe rely on a third party to obtain, process and distribute sports medicine allograft tissue. If such tissue cannot be obtained, is not accepted by the market or is not accepted under numerous government regulations, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nAs described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on January 3, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (\"MTF\") to obtain MTF's worldwide promotional, marketing and distribution rights with respect to allograft tissues within the field of sports medicine. The supply of human tissue is dependent on donors and MTF has numerous relationships with donor groups. Likewise, the supply of tissues available for use as allografts depends on the continued successful processing of donated tissues by MTF at its processing facilities. We cannot be certain, however, that the supply of human tissue will continue to be available at current levels or will be of sufficiently high standards to meet the high processing standards maintained for such tissues by MTF, or in volumes sufficient to meet our customers' needs or that MTF will be able to continue to process tissues to its high standards in volumes sufficient to keep pace with demand. We expect that the Company's share of revenue streams related to MTF's sports medicine allograft product line would decline in proportion to any decline or disruption in the supply of processed tissues.\nThe FDA and several states have statutory authority to regulate allograft processing and allograft-based materials. The FDA could identify deficiencies in future inspections of MTF or MTF's suppliers or promulgate future regulatory rulings that could disrupt our business, reducing profitability.\nOur recent management and organizational changes could adversely affect our business.\nIn the latter half of 2014, Curt Hartman became our President & Chief Executive Officer, having significant industry experience. Since this time, he has implemented organizational changes within our Company, including senior management changes. The experience of our senior executives is a valuable asset to us and, although we believe that our current senior management team has the combination of company and industry experience to be successful, our recent management and organizational changes could adversely affect our business, including through any disruption that may be associated with the organizational changes.\nIf the Company or our business partners are unable to adequately protect our information assets from cyber-based attacks or other security incidents, our operations could be disrupted.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, including the internet, for the storage, processing, and transmission of our electronic, business-related, information assets. We leverage our internal information technology infrastructures, and those of our business partners, to enable, sustain, and support our global business interests. In the event that the Company or our business partners are unable to prevent, detect, and remediate cyber-based attacks or other security incidents in a timely manner, our operations could be disrupted or we may incur financial or reputational losses arising from the theft, alteration, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or destruction of our information assets.\nIf we infringe third parties\u2019 patents, or if we lose our patents or they are held to be invalid, we could become subject to liability and our competitive position could be harmed.\nMuch of the technology used in the markets in which we compete is covered by patents. We have numerous U.S. patents and corresponding foreign patents on products expiring at various dates from 2016 through 2038 and have additional patent applications pending. See Item 1 Business \u201cResearch and Development\u201d and \u201cIntellectual Property\u201d for a further description of our patents. The loss of our patents could reduce the value of the related products and any related competitive advantage. Competitors may also be able to design around our patents and to compete effectively with our products. In addition, the cost of enforcing our patents against third parties and defending our products against patent infringement actions by others could be substantial. We cannot assure you that:\n\u2022\npending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022\npatents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged by competitors;\n\u2022\nour patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage; or\n\u2022\nwe will be successful in defending against pending or future patent infringement claims asserted against our products.\nOrdering patterns of our customers may change resulting in reductions in sales.\nOur hospital and surgery center customers purchase our products in quantities sufficient to meet their anticipated demand. Likewise, our healthcare distributor customers purchase our products for ultimate resale to healthcare providers in quantities sufficient to meet the anticipated requirements of the distributors\u2019 customers. Should inventories of our products owned by our hospital, surgery center and distributor customers grow to levels higher than their requirements, our customers may reduce the ordering of products from us. This could result in reduced sales during a financial accounting period.\nWe can be sued for producing defective products and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover the nature and amount of any product liability claims.\nThe nature of our products as medical devices and today\u2019s litigious environment should be regarded as potential risks which could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The insurance we maintain to protect against claims associated with the use of our products has deductibles and may not adequately cover the amount or nature of any claim asserted against us. We are also exposed to the risk that our insurers may become insolvent or that premiums may increase substantially. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d for a further discussion of the risk of product liability actions and our insurance coverage.\nDamage to our physical properties as a result of windstorm, earthquake, fire or other natural or man-made disaster may cause a financial loss and a loss of customers.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage for physical damage to our property and the resultant losses that could occur during a business interruption, we are required to pay deductibles and our insurance coverage is limited to certain caps. For example, our deductible for windstorm damage to our Florida property amounts to 2% of any loss.\nFurther, while insurance reimburses us for our lost gross earnings during a business interruption, if we are unable to supply our customers with our products for an extended period of time, there can be no assurance that we will regain the customers\u2019 business once the product supply is returned to normal.", "PERMNO": 11547, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CNMD"}
