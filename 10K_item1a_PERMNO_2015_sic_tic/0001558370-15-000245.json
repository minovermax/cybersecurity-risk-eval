RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are those that we deem currently to be material, and do not represent all of the risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider material may in the future become material and impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the following:\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.\nOur economic performance and the value of our properties are subject to developments that affect real estate generally and that are specific to our properties. If our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties:\n\u00b7\ndownturns in the economic conditions at the national, regional or local levels, particularly a decline in one or more of our primary markets;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from other master planned communities, retail properties, office properties or other commercial space;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain substantial amounts of operating and development capital;\n\u00b7\nincreases in interest rates;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of financing, including refinancing or extensions of existing mortgage debt, on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u00b7\nincreased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;\n\u00b7\nfluctuating condominium prices and absorption rates;\n\u00b7\nability to re-let space as leases expire on similar or more favorable terms than the terms of the expiring lease;\n\u00b7\nvacancies and changes in rental rates;\n\u00b7\ndeclines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants;\n\u00b7\ndeclines in consumer confidence and spending that adversely affect our revenue from our retail properties;\n\u00b7\ndecrease in traffic to our retail properties due to the convenience of other retailing options such as the internet;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters or terrorist acts which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;\n\u00b7\nadoption of more restrictive laws and government regulations, including more restrictive zoning, land use or environmental regulations and an increase in real estate taxes; and\n\u00b7\nopposition from local community or political groups with respect to the development, construction or operations at a particular site.\nContinued lower oil prices compared to average oil prices over the past several years may have a significant negative effect on the future economic growth of, and demand for our properties in, certain regions where we have asset concentrations that are highly dependent on the energy sector.\nIn addition to general, regional and national economic conditions, our operating results are impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties. In certain regions where we have asset concentrations, such as the Houston, Texas region (home to a large number of energy companies), economic activity, growth and employment opportunities depend in part on the energy sector.\nA decline in the energy sector, a sustained period of substantially lower oil prices or the perception of a sustained period of substantially lower energy prices in the future, could have a significant negative effect on the performance of energy companies and may lead to layoffs, a significant decrease in economic activity or slower economic growth in these regions. Such a downturn, or the perception of such a downtown, may lead to decreased demand for housing and commercial space in our communities and developments that are located in or near these regions, including The Woodlands, Bridgeland and Conroe MPCs. If we are unable to sell or lease our residential and commercial property in or near these regions, or if we are unable to recover or replace revenue from a tenant that is no longer a going-concern, it could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on certain housing markets.\nThe housing market and the demand from builders for lots vary depending on location. The success of our master planned communities business is heavily dependent on local housing markets in Las Vegas, Nevada; Houston, Texas; and Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C., which in turn are dependent on the health and growth of the economies and availability of credit in these regions.\nWe may be unable to develop and expand our properties.\nOur business objective includes the development and redevelopment of our properties, which we may be unable to do if we do not have or cannot obtain sufficient capital to proceed with planned development, redevelopment or expansion activities. We may be unable to obtain anchor store, mortgage lender and property partner approvals that are required for any such development, redevelopment or expansion. We may abandon redevelopment or expansion activities already under way that we are unable to complete, which may result in charge-offs of costs previously capitalized. In addition, if redevelopment, expansion or reinvestment projects are unsuccessful, the investment in such projects may not be fully recoverable from future operations or sale resulting in impairment charges.\nWe may not be able to obtain permits required for development of our properties.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are required to seek governmental permits for the development of our properties. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. Specifically, our future development plans for Bridgeland require us to obtain permits to develop areas that include wetlands. Although this may not affect us for many years, our inability to obtain such permits would make it more difficult to develop and sell residential or commercial lots at Bridgeland.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the development, redevelopment or construction of our properties.\nOur development or redevelopment activities entail risks that could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:\n\u00b7\nincreased construction costs for a project that exceeded our original estimates due to increases in materials, labor or other costs, which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increased construction costs;\n\u00b7\nconstruction delays or cost overruns, which may increase project development costs;\n\u00b7\nclaims for construction defects after a property has been developed;\n\u00b7\npoor performance or nonperformance by any of our joint venture partners or other third parties on whom we rely;\n\u00b7\nhealth and safety incidents and site accidents;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with building codes and other local regulations; and\n\u00b7\nan inability to secure tenants necessary to support commercial projects or obtain construction financing for the development or redevelopment of our properties.\nDevelopment of properties entails a lengthy, uncertain and costly entitlement process.\nApproval to develop real property entails an extensive entitlement process involving multiple and overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and often requires discretionary action by local governments. This process is often political and uncertain. Real estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. In addition, our competitors and local residents may challenge our efforts to obtain entitlements and permits for the development of properties. The process to comply with these regulations is usually lengthy and costly, may not result in the approvals we seek, and can be expected to materially affect our development activities.\nOur development, construction and sale of condominiums are subject to state regulations and may be subject to claims from the condominium owners association at each project.\nA portion of our business is dedicated to the formation and sale of condominiums. Condominiums are generally regulated by an agency of the state in which they are located or where the condominiums are marketed to be sold. In connection with our development of condominiums and offering of condominium units for sale, we must submit regulatory filings to various state agencies and engage in an entitlement process by which real property owned under one title is converted into individual units. Any responses or comments on our condominium filings may delay our ability to sell condominiums in certain states and other jurisdictions. Further, we will be required to transfer control of a condominium association's board of directors once we trigger one of several statutory thresholds, with the most likely triggers being tied to the sale of not less than a majority of units to third-party owners. Transfer of control can result in claims with respect to deficiencies in operating funds and reserves, constructions defects and other condominium-related matters by the condominium association and/or third-party condominium unit owners. Any material claims in these areas could negatively affect our reputation in condominium development and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole.\nPurchasers may default on their obligations to purchase condominiums.\nWe enter into contracts for the sale of condominium units that generally provide for the payment of a substantial portion of the sales price at closing when a condominium unit is ready to be delivered and occupied. A significant amount of time may pass between the execution of a contract for the purchase of a condominium unit and the closing thereof. Defaults by purchasers to pay any remaining portions of the sales prices for condominium units under contract may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Master Planned Communities segment is highly dependent on homebuilders.\nWe are highly dependent on our relationships with homebuilders to purchase lots at our master planned communities. Our business will be adversely affected if homebuilders do not view our master planned communities as desirable locations for homebuilding operations. Also, some homebuilders may be unwilling or unable to close on previously committed lot purchases. As a result, we may sell fewer lots and may have lower sales revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are subject to significant fluctuation by various factors that are beyond our control.\nOur results of operations are subject to significant fluctuations by various factors that are beyond our control. Fluctuations in these factors may decrease or eliminate the income generated by a property, and include:\n\u00b7\nthe regional and local economy, which may be negatively impacted by material relocation by residents, industry slowdowns, plant closings, increased unemployment, lack of availability of consumer credit, levels of consumer debt, housing market conditions, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors;\n\u00b7\nstrength of the residential housing and condominium markets;\n\u00b7\nlocal real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants;\n\u00b7\nperceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the retail property;\n\u00b7\nthe convenience and quality of competing retail properties and other retailing options such as the internet;\n\u00b7\nour ability to lease space, collect rent and attract new tenants; and\n\u00b7\ntenant rental rates, which may decline for a variety of reasons, including the impact of co-tenancy provisions in lease agreements with certain tenants.\nA decline in our results of operations could have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. On October 2, 2013, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and received net cash proceeds of $739.6 million. As of December 31, 2014, our total consolidated debt was approximately $2.0 billion (excluding an undrawn balance of $103.3 million under our revolving facilities) of which $880.8 million was recourse to the Company. In addition, we have $37.6 million of recourse guarantees associated with undrawn construction financing commitments as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, our share of the debt of our Real Estate and Other Affiliates was $54.6 million based upon our economic ownership. All of the debt of our Real Estate and Other Affiliates is non-recourse to us.\nSubject to the limits contained in the indenture governing the Senior Notes and any limits under our other debt agreements, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness from time to time, including project indebtedness at our subsidiaries. If we do so, the risks related to our level of indebtedness could intensify. Specifically, a high level of indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of the notes and equity holders, including:\n\u00b7\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Senior Notes and our other debt;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate requirements, or requiring us to make non-strategic divestitures, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;\n\u00b7\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given that certain indebtedness bears interest at variable rates;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities, reinvest in and develop properties, and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulations;\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance indebtedness; and\n\u00b7\nresulting in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes or our other debt or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing the Senior Notes or our other debt, which event of default could result in the Senior Notes and all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and, in the case of our secured debt, could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing such debt.\nThe indenture governing our Senior Notes contains, and our other debt agreements contain, restrictions which may limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe indenture governing our Senior Notes contains, and some of our other debt agreements contain, certain restrictions. These restrictions limit our ability or the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u00b7\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nmake investments;\n\u00b7\nincur indebtedness or issue certain equity;\n\u00b7\ncreate certain liens;\n\u00b7\nincur obligations that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend or other payments to us;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u00b7\ncreate or designate unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAdditionally, certain of our debt agreements also contain various restrictive covenants, including minimum net worth requirements, maximum payout ratios on distributions, minimum debt yield ratios, minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratios.\nThe restrictions under the indenture and or other debt agreements could limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities.\nWe may be required to take action to reduce our debt or act in a manner contrary to our business objectives to meet such ratios and satisfy the covenants in our debt agreements. Events beyond our control, including changes in economic and business conditions in the markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to do so. We may not be able to meet the ratios or satisfy the covenants in our debt agreements, and we cannot assure you that our lenders will waive any failure to do so. A breach of any of the covenants in, or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios under, our debt agreements could result in a default under such debt agreements, which could lead to that debt becoming immediately due and payable and, if such debt is secured, foreclosure on our assets that secure such debt. A breach of any of the covenants in, or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios under, our debt agreements also would prevent us from borrowing additional money under such agreements that include revolving lending facilities. A default under any of our debt agreements could, in turn, result in defaults under other obligations and result in other creditors accelerating the payment of other obligations and foreclosing on assets securing such obligations, if any.\nAny such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if the lenders under any of our debt agreements or other obligations accelerate the maturity of those obligations, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under the notes or our other debt.\nSignificant competition could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe nature and extent of the competition we face depends on the type of property. With respect to our master planned communities, we compete with other landholders and residential and commercial property developers in the development of properties within the Las Vegas, Nevada; Houston, Texas; and Baltimore/Washington, D.C. markets. A number of residential and commercial developers, some with greater financial and other resources, compete with us in seeking resources for development and prospective purchasers and tenants. Competition from other real estate developers may adversely affect our ability to attract purchasers and sell residential and commercial real estate, sell undeveloped rural land, attract and retain experienced real estate development personnel, or obtain construction materials and labor. These competitive conditions can make it difficult to sell land at desirable prices and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are numerous shopping facilities that compete with our operating retail properties in attracting retailers to lease space. In addition, retailers at these properties face continued competition from other retailers, including retailers at other regional shopping centers, outlet malls and other discount shopping centers, discount shopping clubs, catalog companies, internet sales and telemarketing. Competition of this type could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we will compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment and development opportunities. These competitors include REITs and private institutional investors.\nOur business model includes entering into joint venture arrangements with strategic partners. This model may not be successful and our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully attract desirable strategic partners or complete agreements with strategic partners or if our strategic partners fail to satisfy their obligations to the joint venture.\nWe currently have and intend to enter into future joint venture partnerships. These joint venture partners may bring local market knowledge and relationships, development experience, industry expertise, financial resources, financing capabilities, brand recognition and credibility or other competitive assets. In the future, we may not have sufficient resources, experience and/or skills to locate desirable partners. We also may not be able to attract partners who want to conduct business in the locations where our properties are located, and who have the assets, reputation or other characteristics that would optimize our development opportunities.\nWhile we generally participate in making decisions for our jointly owned properties and assets, we might not always have the same objectives as the partner in relation to a particular asset, and we might not be able to formally resolve any issues that arise. In addition, actions by a partner may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than those contemplated by the joint venture agreements, be contrary to our instructions or requests or result in adverse consequences. We cannot control the ultimate outcome of any decision made, which may be detrimental to our interests.\nThe bankruptcy of one of the other investors in any of our joint ventures could materially and adversely affect the relevant property or properties. If this occurred, we would be precluded from taking some actions affecting the estate of the other investor without prior court approval which would, in most cases, entail prior notice to other parties and a hearing. At a minimum, the requirement to obtain court approval may delay the actions we would or might want to take. If the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a property has incurred recourse obligations, the discharge in bankruptcy of one of the other investors might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than would otherwise be required.\nWe may not realize the value of our tax assets.\nCertain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code could limit our ability to fully utilize the tax assets if we were to experience a \u201cchange of control\u201d. If such an event were to occur, the cash flow benefits we might otherwise have received would be eliminated. We currently have approximately $109.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards, none of which are subject to the separate return year limitation rules. A change of control could limit our ability to use our net operating losses prior to their expiration.\nSome of our directors are involved in other businesses including real estate activities and public and/or private investments and, therefore, may have competing or conflicting interests with us.\nCertain of our directors have and may in the future have interests in other real estate business activities, and may have control or influence over these activities or may serve as investment advisors, directors or officers. These interests and activities, and any duties to third parties arising from such interests and activities, could divert the attention of such directors from our operations. Additionally, certain of our directors are engaged in investment and other activities in which they may learn of real estate and other related opportunities in their non-director capacities. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to our directors expressly provides, as permitted by Section 122(17) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), that our non-employee directors are not obligated to limit their interests or activities in their non-director capacities or to notify us of any opportunities that may arise in connection therewith, even if the opportunities are complementary to, or in competition with, our businesses. Accordingly, we have no expectation that we will be able to learn of or participate in such opportunities. If any potential business opportunity is expressly presented to a director exclusively in his or her director capacity, the director will not be permitted to pursue the opportunity, directly or indirectly through a controlled affiliate in which the director has an ownership interest, without the approval of the independent members of our board of directors.\nSome of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters.\nA number of our properties are located in areas which are subject to natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and oil spills. Some of our properties, including Ward Centers, South Street Seaport and the Outlet Collection at Riverwalk are located in coastal regions, and could therefore be affected by increases in sea levels, the frequency or severity of hurricanes and tropical storms, or environmental disasters, whether such events are caused by global climate changes or other factors.\nSome potential losses are not insured.\nWe carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. There are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, which generally are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. If this happens, we might remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property.\nPossible terrorist activity or other acts of violence could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture terrorist attacks in the United States or other acts of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. Such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult to renew or re-lease properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates. Terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss, and the availability of insurance for such acts, or of insurance generally, might be lower or cost more, which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that tenants are affected by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases. These acts might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies. Any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of new or redeveloped properties, and limit access to capital or increase the cost of capital.\nWe may be subject to potential costs to comply with environmental laws.\nFuture development opportunities may require additional capital and other expenditures to comply with laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under various federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling, the cost of which may be substantial for certain redevelopments, and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Federal and state laws also regulate the operation and removal of underground storage tanks. In connection with our ownership, operation and management of certain properties, we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to these regulated substances or tanks or related claims.\nWe cannot predict with any certainty the magnitude of any expenditures relating to the environmental compliance or the long-range effect, if any, on our operations. Compliance with such laws has not had a material adverse effect on our operating results or competitive position in the past, but could have such an effect on our operating results and competitive position in the future.\nThere is a risk of investor influence over our company that may be adverse to our best interests and those of our other stockholders.\nPershing Square Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cPershing Square\u201d) beneficially owns 9.0% of our outstanding common stock (excluding shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants) as of December 31, 2014. Under the terms of our stockholder agreements, Pershing Square currently has the ability to designate three members of our board of directors.\nAlthough Pershing Square has entered into a standstill agreement to limit its influence over us, the concentration of ownership of our outstanding common stock held by Pershing Square and other substantial stockholders may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders, or more likely with the support of these stockholders. The interests of our substantial stockholders could conflict with or differ from the interests of our other stockholders. For example, the concentration of ownership held by Pershing Square and other substantial stockholders, even if these stockholders are not acting in a coordinated manner, could allow Pershing Square and other substantial stockholders to influence our policies and strategy and could delay, defer or prevent a change of control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination that may otherwise be favorable to us and our other stockholders.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our tenants and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, Delaware law, stockholders rights agreement and certain other agreements may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain the following limitations:\n\u00b7\nthe inability of our stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting without 15% or more of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of our directors;\n\u00b7\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nWe have also implemented a so-called poison pill by adopting our stockholders rights agreement. The poison pill assists in the preservation of our valuable tax attributes by significantly increasing the costs that would be incurred by an unwanted third party acquirer if such party owns or announces its intent to commence a tender offer for the Threshold Percentage or more of our securities. Subject to stockholder approval, the Board of Directors of the Company has extended the term of the stockholders rights agreement to March 14, 2018. All of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nThere may be dilution of our common stock from the exercise of outstanding warrants, which may materially adversely affect the market price and negatively impact a holder\u2019s investment.", "PERMNO": 12373, "SIC": 6552, "TIC": "HHC"}
