{"cik": "1073429", "company": "U.S. CONCRETE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors represent our current view of the known material risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business. These important factors, among others, sometimes have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during 2020 and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. In addition, these risks and uncertainties could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, common stock price and the price of our debt. Further, the risk factors described below are not the only risks we face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, that we currently consider immaterial, or that are not specific to us. This discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements. Please see \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Item 1 of this report.\nBusiness Risks\nOur business depends on activity within the construction industry and the economic strength of our principal markets.\nWe serve substantially all end markets of the construction industry, and our results of operations are directly affected by the level of activity in the construction industry in the geographic markets we serve. Demand for our products, particularly in the commercial and industrial and residential construction markets, could decline if companies and consumers cannot obtain credit for construction projects or if a slow down in economic activity results in delays or cancellations of projects. During 2019, commercial and industrial construction and residential construction accounted for 60% and 22% of our ready-mixed concrete revenue, respectively. In addition, federal and state budget issues may limit the funding available for infrastructure spending, particularly street, highway and other public works projects, which accounted for 18% of our revenue in 2019.\nWe operate principally in the East Region (New York City, New Jersey, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia); Central Region (Texas and Oklahoma); and West Region (California and British Columbia, Canada) with those markets representing approximately 34%, 34% and 30%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for 2019. Our earnings depend on the economic strength of these markets because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price. If economic and construction activity diminishes in our principal markets, our results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nThere are risks related to our internal growth and operating strategy.\nOur ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:\n\u2022attract new customers;\n\u2022differentiate ourselves in a competitive market by emphasizing new product development and value added services;\n\u2022hire and retain employees; and\n\u2022minimize operating and overhead expenses.\nOur inability to achieve internal growth could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOne key component of our operating strategy is to operate our businesses on a decentralized basis, with local or regional management retaining responsibility for day-to-day operations, profitability and the internal growth of the individual business. If we do not implement and maintain proper overall business controls, this decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices and our overall profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to successfully identify, complete, manage and integrate acquisitions could reduce our earnings and slow our growth.\nWe have completed numerous acquisitions, including most recently the Acquisition. On an ongoing basis, as part of our strategy to pursue growth opportunities, we continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen our business. There is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, the willingness of acquisition candidates we identify to sell; our ability to obtain financing or capital, if needed, on satisfactory terms; and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. The investigation of acquisition candidates and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial\nmanagement time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we fail to complete any acquisition for any reason, including events beyond our control, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed acquisition likely would not be recoverable.\nPotential acquisition targets may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities. In addition, if we enter into new geographic markets, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such additional legal requirements. Our recently completed acquisitions and any future acquisitions could cause us to become involved in labor, commercial, or regulatory disputes or litigation related to any new enterprises and could require us to invest further in operational, financial and management information systems and to attract, retain, motivate and effectively manage local or regional management and additional employees. Upon completion of an acquisition, key members of the acquired company management team may resign, which could require us to attract and retain new management and could make it difficult to maintain customer relationships. Our inability to effectively manage the integration of our completed and future acquisitions could prevent us from realizing expected rates of return on an acquired business and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nTightening of mortgage lending or mortgage financing requirements, higher interest rates or the limitation of the home mortgage interest deduction and the property tax deduction could adversely affect the residential construction market and reduce the demand for new home construction.\nApproximately 22% of our revenue for 2019 was from residential construction contractors. Tightening of mortgage lending, mortgage financing requirements or higher interest rates could adversely affect the ability to obtain credit for some borrowers, or reduce the demand for new home construction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the limitation of the home mortgage interest and property tax deductions could reduce the demand for new home construction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. A downturn in new home construction could also adversely affect our customers focused in residential construction, possibly resulting in slower payments, higher default rates in our accounts receivable and an overall increase in working capital.\nOur ready-mixed concrete segment's revenue attributable to street, highway and other public works projects could be negatively impacted by a decrease or delay in governmental spending.\nDuring 2019, approximately 18% of our ready-mixed concrete revenue was from street, highway and other public works projects. Construction activity on streets, highways and other public works projects is directly related to the amount of government funding available for such projects, which is affected by budget constraints currently being experienced by federal, state and local governments. In addition, prolonged government shutdowns or reductions in government spending, may result in us experiencing delayed orders, delayed payments and declines in revenue, profitability and cash flows. Reduced levels of governmental funding for public works projects or delays in that funding could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is seasonal and subject to adverse weather.\nSince our business is primarily conducted outdoors, erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions affect our business. Adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms, cold weather, snow and heavy or sustained rainfall, reduce construction activity, restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently deliver concrete. Adverse weather conditions could also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss, needed plant and equipment repairs, delays in obtaining permits, time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events. In addition, during periods of extended adverse weather or other operational delays, we may elect to continue to pay certain hourly employees to maintain our workforce, which may adversely impact our results of operations. Severe drought conditions can also restrict available water supplies and restrict production. Consequently, these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur operating results may vary significantly from one reporting period to another and may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.\nThe relative demand for our products is a function of the highly cyclical construction industry. As a result, our revenue may be adversely affected by declines in the construction industry generally and in our regional markets. Our results also may be materially affected by:\n\u2022\nthe level of commercial and residential construction in our regional markets, including reductions in the demand for new residential housing construction below current or historical levels;\n\u2022\nthe availability of funds for public or infrastructure construction from local, state and federal sources;\n\u2022\nunexpected events that delay or adversely affect our ability to deliver concrete according to our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and lending standards;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of our customers and business, which result in periodic variations in the margins on jobs performed during any particular quarter;\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of acquisitions and difficulties or costs encountered when integrating acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe budgetary spending patterns of customers;\n\u2022\nincreases in construction and design costs;\n\u2022\npower outages and other unexpected delays;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs and maintain quality;\n\u2022\npricing pressure due to changes in asset utilization or economic weakness;\n\u2022\nemployment levels; and\n\u2022\nregional or general economic conditions.\nAccordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any other quarter or for the entire year. Furthermore, negative trends in the ready-mixed concrete or aggregates industries or in our geographic markets could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nSignificant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. During our annual impairment test, we may identify events or changes in circumstances that could indicate the fair value of one or more of our reporting units is below its carrying value. For example, a significant downturn in the construction industry may have an adverse effect on the fair value of our reporting units. A decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, non-cash write-down of goodwill.\nOur business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically.\nAggregates are a key component of ready-mixed concrete. In 2019, our ready-mixed concrete businesses purchased 34% of their aggregates needs from internally operated quarries and sites and 66% from third parties. In addition, in 2019, our aggregates segment sold $141.7 million of aggregates to third parties and $53.5 million of aggregates to our ready-mixed concrete operations, generating a total Adjusted EBITDA of $53.8 million.\nBecause aggregates are inexpensive, they are generally cost prohibitive to transport long distances, except in large quantities by water. As a result, access to local supplies of aggregates, whether mined locally or shipped there by water, is critical to the operations of our ready-mixed concrete business. One of our most significant challenges is finding aggregate deposits that we can mine economically with appropriate permits, either within our markets or in long-haul transportation corridors that can economically serve our markets. Due to urban growth, available quarrying locations have been reduced, and communities have imposed restrictions on mining, making aggregates supplies scarce in certain markets. If we are unable to access economical sources of aggregates either internally or from third parties, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows might be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may lose business to competitors who underbid us, and we may be otherwise unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive industry.\nOur competitive position in a given market depends largely on the location and operating costs of our plants and prevailing prices in that market. Price is the primary competitive factor among suppliers for small or less complex jobs, principally in residential construction. However, timeliness of delivery and consistency of quality and service, as well as price, are the principal competitive factors among suppliers for large or complex jobs. Concrete manufacturers like us generally obtain customer contracts through local sales and marketing efforts directed at general contractors, developers, governmental agencies and homebuilders. As a result, we depend on local relationships. We generally do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers.\nOur competitors range from small, owner-operated private companies to subsidiaries or operating units of large, vertically integrated manufacturers of cement and aggregates. Our vertically integrated competitors generally have greater manufacturing, financial and marketing resources than we have, providing them with competitive advantages. Competitors having lower operating costs than we do or having the financial resources to enable them to accept lower margins than we do may have competitive advantages over us for jobs that are particularly price-sensitive. Competitors having greater financial resources or less financial leverage than we do to invest in new mixer trucks, build plants in new areas, or pay for acquisitions also may have competitive advantages over us.\nWe depend on third parties for concrete equipment and materials essential to operate our business.\nWe rely on third parties to sell or lease property, plant and equipment to us and to provide us with materials, including cement, aggregates and other materials, necessary for our operations. We cannot assure you that our favorable working relationships with our suppliers will continue in the future. Also, there have historically been periods of supply shortages in the concrete industry, particularly in a strong economy.\nIf we are unable to purchase or lease necessary properties or equipment, our operations could be severely impacted. If we lose our supply contracts and receive insufficient supplies from third parties to meet our customers\u2019 needs or if our suppliers experience price increases or disruptions to their business, such as labor disputes, supply shortages, or distribution problems, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe use large amounts of electricity and diesel fuel that are subject to potential reliability issues, supply constraints, and significant price fluctuation, which could affect our financial position, operating results and liquidity.\nIn our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity and diesel fuel. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Furthermore, we are vulnerable to any reliability issues experienced by our suppliers, which also are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity from period to period.\nDelays or interruptions of our transportation logistics could affect operating results.\nOur products are distributed to our markets either by trucks, which are primarily Company-owned and/or Company-managed, or ships. Transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers. Any significant delays, disruptions, or the non-availability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations. Transportation operations are subject to factors outside of our control, including capacity constraints, high fuel costs and various hazards, including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages. If there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services, we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to transport our products or fuels at a reasonable cost, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nA significant disruption of our information technology systems may harm our business.\nWe are dependent on our own and our third-party providers\u2019 information technology to support many facets of our business. If our information technology systems are breached, shutdown, destroyed or fail due to cyberattack, unauthorized access, natural disaster or equipment breakdown, by employees, malicious third parties, or other unauthorized persons, our business could be negatively impacted, proprietary information could be lost, stolen or destroyed, and our reputation could be damaged. We take\nmeasures to protect our information technology systems and data from such occurrences, but as cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, there can be no guarantee that our actions, efforts, and security measures adopted will always prevent them. Further, while we maintain cyber insurance, it may not be sufficient to cover all losses that result from interruptions or breaches of our information technology systems. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe departure of key personnel could affect our financial results.\nWe depend on the efforts of our officers and, in many cases, on senior management of our businesses. Our success depends on retaining our officers and senior-level managers. We need to ensure that key personnel are compensated fairly and competitively to reduce the risk of their departure to our competitors or other industries. Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success. Our failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior-level management could adversely affect our strategic planning and execution. To the extent we are unable to attract or retain qualified management personnel, or effectively implement succession plans, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We do not carry key personnel life insurance on any of our employees.\nShortages of qualified employees may harm our business.\nOur ability to provide high-quality products and services on a timely basis depends on our success in employing an adequate number of skilled plant managers, technicians and drivers. Like many of our competitors, we experience shortages of qualified personnel from time to time. We may not be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy, and our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel.\nCollective bargaining agreements, work stoppages, and other labor relations matters may result in increases in our operating costs, disruptions in our business and decreases in our earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 34.0% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, which expire between 2018 and 2024. We are actively negotiating two of our contracts which had expired as of December 31, 2019. Our inability to negotiate acceptable new contracts or extensions of existing contracts with these unions could cause work stoppages by the affected employees. In addition, any new contracts or extensions could result in increased operating costs attributable to both union and nonunion employees. If any such work stoppages were to occur, or if other of our employees were to become represented by a union, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. Also, labor relations matters affecting our suppliers of cement and aggregates could adversely impact our business from time to time.\nParticipation in multi-employer defined benefit plans may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe actively contribute to 17 multi-employer defined benefit plans, which are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \u201cPPA\u201d). For multi-employer defined benefit plans, the PPA established new funding requirements or rehabilitation requirements, additional funding rules for plans that are in endangered or critical status and enhanced disclosure requirements to participants regarding a plan\u2019s funding status. The Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 (the \u201cWRERA\u201d) provided some funding relief to defined benefit plan sponsors affected by the financial crisis. The WRERA allowed multi-employer plan sponsors to elect to freeze their funded status at the same funding status as the preceding plan year (for example, a calendar year plan that was not in critical or endangered status for 2008 was able to elect to retain that status for 2009) and sponsors of multi-employer plans in endangered or critical status in plan years beginning in 2008 or 2009 were allowed a three-year extension of funding improvement or rehabilitation plans (extending the timeline for these plans to achieve their goals from 10 years to 13 years, or from 15 years to 18 years for seriously endangered plans). A number of the multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute are underfunded and are currently subject to funding improvement or rehabilitation requirements. Additionally, if we were to withdraw partially or completely from any plan that is underfunded, we would be liable for a proportionate share of that plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. Based on the information available from plan administrators, we believe that our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full or partial withdrawal from or termination of several of these plans or the inability of plan sponsors to meet the funding or rehabilitation requirements would be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur overall profitability is sensitive to price changes and variations in sales volumes.\nGenerally, our customers are price-sensitive. Prices for our products are subject to changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand, general economic conditions and market conditions, all of which are beyond our control. Our overall profitability is sensitive to price changes, and variations in sales volumes and pricing could have a material adverse effect.\nAny material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nAny material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Remedies are available to us in the event of nonpayment, including liens or other legal remedies; however, cash flows may be delayed or we may receive significantly less than the amount owed to us. In the event of any customer's breach, we may also choose to renegotiate any agreement on less favorable terms for us to preserve the customer relationship.\nInstability in the financial and credit sectors may impact our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nAdverse or worsening economic trends could have a negative impact on our suppliers and our customers and their financial condition and liquidity, which could cause them to fail to meet their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, income from operations and cash flows. The uncertainty and volatility of the financial and credit sectors could have further impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict or anticipate.\nTurmoil in the global financial system could have an impact on our business and our financial condition. Accordingly, our ability to access the capital markets could be restricted or be available only on unfavorable terms. Limited access to the capital markets could adversely impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or react to changing economic and business conditions and could adversely impact our ability to execute our long-term growth strategy. Ultimately, we could be required to reduce our future capital expenditures substantially. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, income from operations and cash flows.\nIf one or more of the lenders under our Revolving Facility, which provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $350.0 million, subject to the borrowing base, were to become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under that facility, our borrowing capacity could be reduced. Our inability to borrow additional amounts under our Revolving Facility could limit our ability to fund our operations and growth.\nGovernmental regulations, including environmental regulations, may result in increases in our operating costs and capital expenditures and decreases in our earnings.\nA wide range of federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations apply to our operations, including the following matters:\n\u2022water usage;\n\u2022land usage;\n\u2022street and highway usage;\n\u2022noise levels;\n\u2022operating hours; and\n\u2022health, safety and environmental matters.\nIn many instances, we must have various certificates, permits, or licenses to conduct our business. Our failure to maintain required certificates, permits, or licenses or to comply with applicable governmental requirements could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. Delays in obtaining approvals for the transfer or grant of certificates, permits or licenses, or failure to obtain new certificates, permits or licenses, could impede the implementation of any acquisitions.\nGovernmental requirements that impact our operations include those relating to air quality, solid and hazardous waste management and cleanup and water quality. These requirements are complex and subject to change. Certain laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, can impose strict liability in some cases without regard\nto negligence or fault, including for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. Our compliance with amended, new or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, or the future discovery of environmental conditions may require us to make unanticipated material expenditures. In addition, we may fail to identify, or obtain indemnification for, environmental liabilities of acquired businesses.\nOur operations are subject to various hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage and increase our operating costs.\nOperating mixer trucks, particularly when loaded, exposes our drivers and others to traffic hazards. Our drivers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing services on construction sites, while our plant personnel are subject to the hazards associated with moving and storing large quantities of heavy raw materials. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. Although we conduct training programs designed to reduce these risks, we cannot eliminate these risks. We maintain insurance coverage against certain workers' compensation, automobile and general liability risks. Under certain components of our insurance program, we share the risk of loss with our insurance underwriters by maintaining high deductibles subject to aggregate annual loss limitations. This insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations, and we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types or at levels we deem necessary or adequate, or at rates we consider reasonable. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of sufficient magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe insurance policies we maintain are subject to varying levels of deductibles. Losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows might be materially and adversely affected.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the Company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIf, as a result of deficiencies in our internal controls, we cannot provide reliable financial statements, our business decision process may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our securities could decrease, and our ability to obtain additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be adversely affected. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could result in investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities. In addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, by definition, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Such an occurrence could discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, result in higher borrowing costs and affect how our stock trades. This could in turn affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital.\nThe adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results.\nThe accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time. New or revised accounting standards could, either positively or negatively, affect results reported for periods\nafter adoption of the standards as compared to the prior periods, or require retrospective application changing results reported for prior periods.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other related rules and regulations, have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance. Reports from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\u2019s (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations that could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits. The Company\u2019s costs to respond to these additional requirements may increase.\nU.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017 may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, the following that impact us: (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) extension and expansion of the bonus depreciation provisions; (3) creation of a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (4) repeal of the domestic production activities deduction; (5) enactment of a provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) of foreign subsidiaries; (6) further limitation of the deductibility of certain executive compensation; and (7) limitation of certain other deductions. We have established a valuation allowance related to the interest expense limitation carryforward attribute resulting from the Tax Act, which we do not believe is more likely than not to be realized under the current interpretation of the applicable statute. Certain provisions of the Tax Act, primarily the interest expense limitation, have resulted in our effective income tax rate being substantially higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0%.\nWe may incur material costs and losses as a result of claims that our products do not meet regulatory requirements or contractual specifications.\nOur operations involve providing products that must meet building code or other regulatory requirements and contractual specifications for durability, stress-level capacity, weight-bearing capacity and other characteristics. If we fail or are unable to provide products meeting these requirements and specifications, material claims may arise against us, and our reputation could be damaged. In the past, we have had significant claims of this kind asserted against us that we have resolved. There currently are claims, and we expect that in the future there will be additional claims, of this kind asserted against us. If a significant product-related claim or claims are resolved against us in the future, that resolution may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nSome of our plants are susceptible to damage from natural disasters, for which we have a limited amount of insurance; our business and profitability could be adversely affected if the operations of one or more of our facilities were interrupted or shut down as the result of a natural disaster.\nWe maintain only a limited amount of insurance for natural disasters. A natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facilities due to earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood, severe weather or any other cause could substantially disrupt our operations. In addition, we could incur significantly higher costs during the time it takes us to reopen or replace one or more of our facilities, which may or may not be reimbursed by insurance. The adverse effects of a natural disaster could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nIncreasing insurance claims and expenses could lower our profitability and increase our business risk.\nThe nature of our business subjects us to product liability, property damage, business interruption, personal injury and workers\u2019 compensation claims from time to time. Increased premiums charged by insurance carriers may further increase our insurance expense as coverage expires or otherwise cause us to raise our self-insured retention. If the number or severity of claims within our self-insured retention increases, we could suffer losses in excess of our reserves. An unusually large liability claim or a string of claims based on a failure repeated throughout our mass production process may exceed our insurance coverage or result in direct damages if we were unable or elected not to insure against certain hazards because of high premiums or other reasons. In addition, the availability of, and our ability to collect on, insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control. Further, allegations relating to workers\u2019 compensation violations may result in investigations by insurance regulatory or other governmental authorities, which investigations, if any, could have a direct or indirect material adverse effect on our ability to pursue certain types of business which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2024 (\u201c2024 Notes\u201d) issued as securities pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 7, 2016, among the Company, certain subsidiary guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d) as supplemented to date (the \u201cIndenture\u201d). We and certain of our subsidiaries are also parties to a Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cThird Loan Agreement\u201d), with certain financial institutions named therein, as lenders (the \u201cLenders\u201d), and Bank of America, N.A. as agent and sole lead arranger, that is secured by certain assets of the Company and the guarantors. The Third Loan Agreement provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $350.0 million subject to a borrowing base under the Revolving Facility. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.\nThe covenants in the Third Loan Agreement and the Indenture allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources in certain circumstances.\nAs a result of our existing indebtedness and our capacity to incur additional indebtedness, we are, and anticipate continuing to be, a highly leveraged company. A significant portion of our cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available under our Revolving Facility, to enable us to repay our indebtedness, including the 2024 Notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit requires us to use a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations for debt service and the repayment of our indebtedness, including indebtedness we may incur in the future, and such cash flow may not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nit limits our ability to borrow money or sell assets to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nour interest expense could increase if interest rates in general increase, because borrowings under our Revolving Facility bear interest at floating rates;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nwe are more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nit may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy;\n\u2022\nit may increase our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nit may restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\ndebt service requirements could make it more difficult for us to make payments on the 2024 Notes and our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nthe interest limitation enacted as part of the Tax Act could increase our effective tax rate and income taxes payable; and\n\u2022\nthere would be a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, if we were unable to refinance, service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, as needed.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future sources of capital under the Revolving Facility or otherwise may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we complete an acquisition, our debt service requirements could increase. We may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Revolving Facility and the 2024 Notes, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances or restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAny refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The Third Loan Agreement and the Indenture restrict our\nability to conduct asset sales and to use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate these asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.\nWe may still be able to incur significantly more debt, including secured debt. This could intensify already-existing risks related to our indebtedness.\nThe terms of the Indenture and the Third Loan Agreement contain restrictions on our and the guarantors\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness. However, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we or the guarantors could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, much of which could constitute secured, senior, or pari passu indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, our Revolving Facility provided for unused borrowing capacity of up to $243.7 million.\nThe Indenture permits us to incur certain additional secured debt, allows our non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt and does not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness as defined in the Indenture. The Indenture also, under certain circumstances, allows us to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. Those unrestricted subsidiaries will not be subject to many of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, and, therefore will be able to incur indebtedness beyond the limitations specified in the Indenture and engage in other activities in which restricted subsidiaries may not engage. If new debt is added to our currently anticipated debt levels, the related risks that we and the guarantors now face could intensify.\nWe may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions, which may increase our indebtedness. Moreover, although the Third Loan Agreement and the Indenture contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends, we will be able to make substantial restricted payments under certain circumstances.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted under our Revolving Facility may fluctuate significantly and/or subject us to interest rate risk, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our Revolving Facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of, among other things, our eligible accounts receivable, inventory and mixer trucks and, under certain circumstances, our machinery. As a result, our access to credit under our Revolving Facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base eligible assets as of any measurement date, as well as certain discretionary rights of the administrative agent of our Revolving Facility in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value. Our inability to borrow at current advance rates or at all under, or the early termination of, our Revolving Facility may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nFurther, borrowings under our Revolving Facility are at variable rates of interest based on the base rate or the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nTo the extent we make borrowings based on LIBOR, LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on multiple factors, including general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established or if LIBOR continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index. Changes to the reference rates on which the interest rates of our borrowings are based may have a negative impact on our interest expense and profitability.\nRepayment of our debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company and substantially all of our tangible assets are owned by our subsidiaries. As such, repayment of our indebtedness, to a certain degree, is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries (including any subsidiaries that are not guarantors) and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment, or otherwise. Our\nsubsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions or other payments to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions or our permanently invested assertion may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the terms of the Indenture and the Third Loan Agreement limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required payments on our indebtedness.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nOur debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2024 Notes. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the 2024 Notes. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the potential effect of risks relating to the structure of the 2024 Notes.\nOur debt agreements may restrict our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the Third Loan Agreement, the Indenture or any agreement under which we have incurred other indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nThe Third Loan Agreement and the Indenture impose, and future financing agreements are likely to impose, operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase or redeem our stock or subordinated indebtedness, or make certain investments;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nsell assets and issue capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, make loans to other U.S. Concrete entities or restrict the ability to provide liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to the Indenture, designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe restrictive covenants in the Third Loan Agreement also require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests in certain circumstances.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants and maintain these financial tests. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, an event of default under the Third Loan Agreement would permit the Lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the Revolving Facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our Revolving Facility, those Lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022limited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions, along with restrictions that may be contained in agreements evidencing or governing future indebtedness, may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our growth strategy.\nThe Third Loan Agreement contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant if our Availability (as defined in the Third Loan Agreement) falls below a certain threshold. In addition, the Revolving Facility requires us to comply with various operational and other covenants. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the heading \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a discussion of the financial covenants contained in the Third Loan Agreement. If we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control, we may not be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities. If, as or when required, we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under, or amend the covenants contained in, the Third Loan Agreement, the Lenders could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against the assets securing their borrowings.\nThe Third Loan Agreement provides the Lenders considerable discretion to impose reserves or availability blocks or reduce the advance rates used to calculate the value of our borrowing base, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us. There can be no assurance that the Lenders will not take such actions during the term of that facility and, further, were they to do so, the resulting impact of such actions could materially and adversely impair our ability to make interest payments on the 2024 Notes or meet our other obligations as they become due, among other matters.\nOur subsidiary, Polaris Materials Corporation, exposes us to legal, political and economic risks in Canada as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations that could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nInternational business is subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022imposition of governmental controls and changes in laws, regulations or policies;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations, devaluations and other conversion restrictions;\n\u2022uncertain and changing tax rules, regulations and rates;\n\u2022logistical challenges;\n\u2022changes in regulatory practices, including tariffs and taxes;\n\u2022changes in labor conditions;\n\u2022general economic, political and financial conditions in foreign markets; and\n\u2022\nexposure to civil or criminal liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, anti-boycott rules, trade and export control regulations, as well as other international regulations.\nU.S. international trade policy is subject to change. For example, in November 2018, the U.S. negotiated and signed a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico known in the U.S. as the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (the \"USMCA\"), aimed at re-negotiating and updating the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"). The USMCA was revised by the parties on December 10, 2019. The USMCA requires ratification by legislative bodies in all three countries before it can take effect. As of the date of this filing, the USMCA has been ratified by the U.S. and Mexico. If the USMCA is not ratified by Canada and the U.S. were to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA or other international trade agreements to which it is a party, or if the U.S. were to engage in trade disputes or the imposition of tariffs, such actions could cause an increase in customs duties that, in turn, could adversely affect intercompany transactions among our operating subsidiaries in Canada and the U.S. and increase transaction costs with third-party suppliers and customers.\nCommon Stock Investment Risks\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock to date, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to reinvest all future earnings in the development and growth of our\nbusiness. In addition, our Third Loan Agreement and the Indenture limit our ability to pay dividends, and future loan agreements may also prohibit the payment of dividends. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, business opportunities, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant. To the extent we do not pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nIn recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the operating performance of specific companies. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022news announcements relating to us or our competitors, the job market in general and unemployment data;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts;\n\u2022changes in general economic conditions;\n\u2022changes in interest rates and inflation;\n\u2022the arrival or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022acquisitions or other transactions involving us or our competitors; and\n\u2022other developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, third amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our third amended and restated bylaws and applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, Delaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our common stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors.\nFailure to meet our financial guidance or achieve other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.\nFrom time to time, we provide public guidance on our expected financial results or disclose other forward-looking information for future periods. We manage our business to maximize our growth and profitability and not to achieve financial or operating targets for any particular reporting period. Although we believe that public guidance may provide investors with a better understanding of our expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, such guidance is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Any such guidance or other forward-looking statements are predictions based on our then existing expectations and projections about future events that we believe are reasonable. Actual events or results may differ materially from our expectations, and as such, our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We are under no duty to update any of our forward-looking statements to conform to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by federal securities laws. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investors, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline and stockholders could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.", "PERMNO": 86915, "SIC": 3270, "TIC": "USCR"}
