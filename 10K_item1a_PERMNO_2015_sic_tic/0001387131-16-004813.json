RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information in this report before trading our securities.\nRisk Factors Related to our Business\nAdverse events concerning our existing tenants or negative market conditions affecting our existing tenants could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, release space, collect rent or renew leases, and thus could adversely affect cash flow from operations and inhibit growth.\nCash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which the Company has limited or no control, such as:\n\u00b7 lack of demand for space in areas where the properties are located;\n\u00b7 inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;\n\u00b7 oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates;\n\u00b7 defaults by tenants or failure to pay rent on a timely basis;\n\u00b7 the need to periodically renovate and repair marketable space;\n\u00b7 physical damage to properties;\n\u00b7 economic or physical decline of the areas where properties are located; and\n\u00b7 potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time.\nAt any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant\u2019s lease and material losses to the Company.\nIf tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent the space. Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for space that is re-let, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction costs. Any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance, and debt service payments, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental income from the properties.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully with other entities that operate in our industry.\nWe experience a great deal of competition in attracting tenants for the properties and in locating land to develop and properties to acquire.\nIn our effort to lease properties, we compete for tenants with a broad spectrum of other landlords in each of the markets. These competitors include, among others, publicly-held REITs, privately-held entities, individual property owners and tenants who wish to sublease their space. Some of these competitors may be able to offer prospective tenants more attractive financial terms than we are able to offer.\nIf the availability of land or high quality properties in our markets diminishes, operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe may experience increased operating costs which could adversely affect our financial results and the value of our properties.\nOur properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as insurance, cleaning, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, administrative costs and other costs associated with security, landscaping, repairs, and maintenance of the properties. While some current tenants are obligated by their leases to reimburse us for a portion of these costs, there is no assurance that these tenants will make such payments or agree to pay these costs upon renewal or new tenants will agree to pay these costs. If operating expenses increase in our markets, we may not be able to increase rents or reimbursements in all of these markets to offset the increased expenses, without at the same time decreasing occupancy rates. If this occurs, our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to achieve growth in operating income depends in part on its ability to develop additional properties.\nWe intend to continue to develop properties where warranted by market conditions. We have a number of ongoing development and land projects being readied for commencement.\nAdditionally, general construction and development activities include the following risks:\n\u00b7 construction and leasing of a property may not be completed on schedule, which could result in increased expenses and construction costs, and would result in reduced profitability for that property;\n\u00b7 construction costs may exceed original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased cost of materials, labor or other costs, possibly making the property less profitable because of inability to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs;\n\u00b7 some developments may fail to achieve expectations, possibly making them less profitable;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;\n\u00b7 we may abandon development opportunities after the initial exploration, which may result in failure to recover costs already incurred. If we determine to alter or discontinue its development efforts, future costs of the investment may be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized and we may determine the investment is impaired resulting in a loss;\n\u00b7 we may expend funds on and devote management\u2019s time to projects which will not be completed; and\n\u00b7 occupancy rates and rents at newly-completed properties may fluctuate depending on various factors including market and economic conditions, and may result in lower than projected rental rates and reduced income from operations.\nWe face risks associated with property acquisitions.\nWe acquire individual properties and various portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so. Acquisition activities are subject to the following risks:\n\u00b7 when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the seller\u2019s offering price;\n\u00b7 acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;\n\u00b7 the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than original estimates;\n\u00b7 acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and\n\u00b7 we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into existing operations, and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. However, if an unknown liability was later asserted against the acquired properties, we might be required to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect cash flow.\nMany of our properties are concentrated in our primary markets and the Company may suffer economic harm as a result of adverse conditions in those markets.\nOur properties are located principally in specific geographic areas in the southwestern, southeastern, and mid-western United States. The Company\u2019s overall performance is largely dependent on economic conditions in those regions.\nWe are leveraged and may not be able to meet our debt service obligations.\nWe had total indebtedness at December 31, 2015 of approximately $821.5 million. Substantially all assets have been pledged to secure debt. These borrowings increase the risk of loss because they represent a prior claim on assets and most require fixed payments regardless of profitability. Our leveraged position makes us vulnerable to declines in the general economy and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue other business opportunities in the future.\nWe may not be able to access financial markets to obtain capital on a timely basis, or on acceptable terms.\nWe rely on proceeds from property dispositions and third party capital sources for a portion of our capital needs, including capital for acquisitions and development. The public debt and equity markets are also among the sources upon which the Company relies. There is no guarantee that we will be able to access these markets or any other source of capital. The ability to access the public debt and equity markets depends on a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7 general economic conditions affecting these markets;\n\u00b7 our own financial structure and performance;\n\u00b7 the market\u2019s opinion of real estate companies in general; and\n\u00b7 the market\u2019s opinion of real estate companies that own similar properties.\nWe may suffer adverse effects as a result of terms and covenants relating to the Company\u2019s indebtedness.\nRequired payments on our indebtedness generally are not reduced if the economic performance of the portfolio declines. If the economic performance declines, net income, cash flow from operations and cash available for distribution to stockholders may be reduced. If payments on debt cannot be made, we could sustain a loss or suffer judgments, or in the case of mortgages, suffer foreclosures by mortgagees. Further, some obligations contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which means that a default on one obligation may constitute a default on other obligations.\nWe anticipate only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the maturing debt. If principal balances due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended, or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as the proceeds of sales of assets or new equity capital, cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant \u201cballoon\u201d payments come due.\nOur credit facilities and unsecured debt contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on the ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our continued ability to borrow is subject to compliance with financial and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under credit facilities, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available, or be available only on terms that are detrimental to the Company.\nOur degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. The degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the general economy.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact the ability to refinance existing debt.\nWe currently have, and may incur more, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will the interest costs, which could adversely affect cash flow and the ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures.\nUnbudgeted capital expenditures or cost overruns could adversely affect business operations and cash flow.\nIf capital expenditures for ongoing or planned development projects or renovations exceed expectations, the additional cost of these expenditures could have an adverse effect on business operations and cash flow. In addition, we might not have access to funds on a timely basis to pay for the unexpected expenditures.\nConstruction costs are funded in large part through construction financing, which the Company may guarantee. The Company\u2019s obligation to pay interest on this financing continues until the rental project is completed, leased-up and permanent financing is obtained, or the project is sold, or the construction loan is otherwise paid. Unexpected delays in completion of one or more ongoing projects could also have a significant adverse impact on business operations and cash flow.\nWe may need to sell properties from time to time for cash flow purposes.\nBecause of the lack of liquidity of real estate investments generally, our ability to respond to changing circumstances may be limited. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In the event that we must sell assets to generate cash flow, we cannot predict whether there will be a market for those assets in the time period desired, or whether we will be able to sell the assets at a price that will allow the Company to fully recoup its investment. We may not be able to realize the full potential value of the assets and may incur costs related to the early extinguishment of the debt secured by such assets.\nWe intend to devote resources to the development of new projects.\nWe plan to continue developing new projects as opportunities arise in the future. Development and construction activities entail a number of risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 we may abandon a project after spending time and money determining its feasibility;\n\u00b7 construction costs may materially exceed original estimates;\n\u00b7 the revenue from a new project may not be enough to make it profitable or generate a positive cash flow;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development of a property, if at all;\n\u00b7 we may not complete construction and lease-ups on schedule, resulting in increased development or carrying costs; and\n\u00b7 we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, necessary governmental permits.\nThe overall business is subject to all of the risks associated with the real estate industry.\nWe are subject to all risks incident to investment in real estate, many of which relate to the general lack of liquidity of real estate investments, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 our real estate assets are concentrated primarily in the southwest and any deterioration in the general economic conditions of this region could have an adverse effect;\n\u00b7 changes in interest rates may make the ability to satisfy overall debt service requirements more burdensome;\n\u00b7 lack of availability of financing may render the purchase, sale or refinancing of a property more difficult or unattractive;\n\u00b7 changes in real estate and zoning laws;\n\u00b7 increases in real estate taxes and insurance costs;\n\u00b7 federal or local regulations or rent controls;\n\u00b7 acts of terrorism, and\n\u00b7 hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other similar natural disasters.\nOur performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.\nOur economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties:\n\u00b7 downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);\n\u00b7 competition from other office, apartment and commercial buildings;\n\u00b7 local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, apartments or other commercial space;\n\u00b7 changes in interest rates and availability of financing;\n\u00b7 vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;\n\u00b7 increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;\n\u00b7 civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;\n\u00b7 significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;\n\u00b7 declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and\n\u00b7 decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.\nAdverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole or by the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located, including the current dislocations in the credit markets and general global economic recession. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition as a result of the following, among other potential consequences:\n\u00b7 the financial condition of our tenants may be adversely affected which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons;\n\u00b7 significant job losses within our tenants may occur, which may decrease demand for our office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;\n\u00b7 our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense;\n\u00b7 reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; and\n\u00b7 one or more lenders could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all.\nReal estate investments are illiquid, and the Company may not be able to sell properties if and when it is appropriate to do so.\nReal estate generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to dispose of properties promptly in response to economic or other conditions. In addition, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to sell properties (without incurring significant tax costs) in some situations when it may be otherwise economically advantageous to do so, thereby adversely affecting returns to stockholders and adversely impacting our ability to meet our obligations.", "PERMNO": 49322, "SIC": 6513, "TIC": "ARL"}
