RISK FACTORS.\nThe following discussion is divided into six sections, and is summarized under the caption \"Risk Factors Summary.\" The first section, captioned \u201cRisks Related to COVID-19,\u201d discusses some of the risks relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as efforts to mitigate the effects thereof. The second section, captioned \u201cRisks Related to Our Industry,\u201d discusses some of the risks relating to the mailing and shipping technology industry in which we operate. The third section, captioned \u201cRisks Related to Our Business,\u201d discusses some of the risks relating to our business operations. The fourth section, captioned \u201cRisks Related to Our Finances, Liquidity and Taxation,\u201d discusses some of the risks relating to our liquidity, capital resources and tax exposure. The fifth section, captioned \u201cRisks Related to Our Common Stock,\u201d discusses some of the risks particular to an investment in our common stock. The sixth section, captioned \u201cRisks Related to General Economic and Market Conditions,\u201d discusses some of the risks applicable to businesses, such as ours, that rely closely on broader commerce.\nYou should carefully consider all of the following risks and the other information in this Report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) before you decide to invest in our Company or to maintain or increase your investment. The risks included in this section are not the only ones we face. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the potential impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the significant and unprecedented uncertainty regarding the business and economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (as well as the impact of efforts of governments, businesses and individuals to mitigate the effects of such pandemic) on us, our customers, our carrier and integration partners and the global economy, makes it particularly difficult to predict the nature and extent of impacts on demand for our products and services, making our business outlook subject to considerable uncertainty. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of the other risks we face. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThis Report contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about us and the Internet. See the discussion of forward-looking statements on page 1 of Part I of this Report.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks we perceive associated with an investment in our securities, each of which is discussed in greater detail in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the Report and, neither should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\n\u2022The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow, including indirectly, by adversely affect our carrier partners\u2019 or our integration partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 businesses;\n\u2022We may not be able to sustain our recent revenue growth rate, and, if the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and consumers revert to pre-pandemic shopping habits, our business could contract rapidly; and\n\u2022The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate many of the other risks facing our company, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n\u2022If we are unable to protect our information technology systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation may be harmed and we could be subject to legal and/or regulatory proceedings and liability;\n\u2022We are exposed to risks associated with the collection of credit card information and other customer data and the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks;\n\u2022USPS policy, postal reform or government regulations may cause disruptions to, or the discontinuance of our business and adversely affect our ability to compete and our results of operations;\n\u2022Our business is subject to extensive and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations including those regarding privacy and cyber security, and we may be adversely affected by the demands of compliance and/or by our liability for any failure to comply; and\n\u2022Our operating results could be adversely affected by consolidation and/or the vertical integration of our competitors, partners and potential customers.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u2022Carriers whose services we offer to our customers could fail to compete successfully with existing or future competitors, resulting in reduced demand for our products and services;\n\u2022If we are unable to compete successfully against alternative methods of accessing relevant mailing and shipping services, or if we are unable to respond effectively to technological and market changes, our business and operating results will suffer;\n\u2022The discontinuation of certain financial compensation arrangements with the USPS will have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results, unless we are successful in replacing the lost revenue and profit with similar compensation from the USPS or other potential partners;\n\u2022Carriers, e-commerce technology platforms, or our other business and integration partners could modify, discontinue or terminate agreements, strategic alliances, compensation arrangements and other relationships, including with third parties, or cause discounts our customers receive to be diminished or terminated, which would have an adverse effect on us;\n\u2022If we fail to effectively market and sell our services and products, to meet and anticipate the demands of our current and prospective customers, or to further develop and upgrade our services and products, then our business will be substantially harmed and could fail;\n\u2022Our expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks and places a significant strain on our management, operational, financial, and other resources;\n\u2022Brexit, geopolitical uncertainty, and changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, import and excise duties, taxes or other governmental rules and regulations could reduce cross-border trade or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations;\n\u2022We may be subject to increased customs and regulatory risks from cross-border transactions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022If we do not successfully attract and retain skilled personnel for permanent management and other key personnel positions, we may not be able to effectively implement our business plan; and\n\u2022Pending or future litigation, assertions of violations of intellectual property rights or a failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results.\nRisks Related to Our Finances, Liquidity and Taxation\n\u2022Increases in payment processing fees, any decline in our ability to effectively bill our customers by credit card and debit card or any increase in credit card fraud may increase our operating expenses;\n\u25e6We are exposed to risks associated with the credit and capital markets and if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and fund our other capital requirements, our liquidity, financial condition, cash flow and reported earnings would be adversely affected;\n\u25e6Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement imposes certain limitations on our ability to make dividend payments and to engage in further borrowing, which could hamper our control over liquidity;\n\u25e6We do not collect sales or consumption taxes in some jurisdictions, and we could be subject to material liabilities if successfully challenged; and\n\u25e6We could be subject to changes in our effective tax rate which may reduce our net income.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022Several provisions of the DGCL and our governing documents could discourage a merger or acquisition, or the USPS may object to a change of control of our common stock, which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares and adversely affect the market price of our common stock;\n\u2022Our stock price has been volatile, which may make us a target for securities class action litigation; and\n\u2022We may expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies or technologies, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and consume resources that may be necessary to sustain our business.\nRisks Related to General Economic and Market Conditions\n\u2022Global and regional economic political and other conditions could change, and political events, war, terrorism, public health issues and natural disasters could occur, unexpectedly and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has led to severe disruption to general economic activities as governments and businesses take actions to mitigate the public health crisis. The extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic ultimately impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions taken to contain the virus, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume, if at all. Even if the COVID-19 global pandemic subsides, we may continue to experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any resulting economic recession.\nThe complete impact on our business from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (including, for purposes of these Risk Factors, the efforts of governments and individuals to mitigate the effects of such pandemic) is unknown at this time and difficult to predict. In addition, as described below under \u201cWe may not be able to sustain our recent revenue growth rate in the future, and, if the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and consumers revert to pre-pandemic shopping habits, our business could contract rapidly,\u201d during 2020 we experienced revenue growth related to COVID-19 that is unlikely to be sustainable.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility in global markets. The spread of COVID-19 coronavirus has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially as to travel and congregating in large numbers. In addition, various states and municipalities have from time to time enacted, and/or may enact, quarantining and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d regulations which severely limit the ability of people to move and travel, and require non-essential businesses and organizations to close.\nThere is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of these closures and other business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its impact on the US and world economies and, in particular on the commercial habits and operations of our customers. While a reduction in consumer willingness to visit malls and shopping centers, and employee willingness to staff brick and mortar stores, could be advantageous to e-commerce, such advantages may be more than offset by a general reduction of consumer activity. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our future results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity and transmissivity of COVID-19 (including any variants or mutations thereof) and the actions taken to contain it or mitigate its impact.\nIt is unclear how such restrictions, should they continue for an extended period, which will contribute to a general slowdown in the global economy, will affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and our future strategic plans.\nAlthough the impacts of the pandemic cannot be predicted at this time, some potential impacts from the pandemic could include:\n\u2022If there is a significant reduction or failure of small businesses in the US, that could result in an increase in our rate of customer loss and slower and/or more difficult customer acquisition;\n\u2022If shipper customers that we do retain have reduced sales, then we are likely to experience lower ARPU;\n\u2022Supply chain, governmental or other disruptions that adversely affect our operations and/or those of our customers;\n\u2022Increased risks of IT disruptions and/or cyber attacks as a result of our employees, customers or partners working remotely;\n\u2022Disruption of our operations as a result of the illness or social distancing of our employees or partners;\n\u2022Changes in the financial markets and/or our cash flows which adversely affect our stock price; and/or\n\u2022Increases in the cost or availability, or changes to the terms, of insurance.\nWhile substantially all of our business operations can be performed remotely, many of our employees are balancing additional work-related and personal challenges, including preparing for a prolonged duration of remote working environments, adjusting communication and work practices to collaborate remotely with work colleagues and business partners, managing technical and communication challenges of working from home on a daily basis, looking after children as a result of school closures and remote-learning, making plans for childcare as children prepare to return to schools, and caring for themselves, family members or other dependents who are or may become ill. Similarly, many of our customers, vendors and other third parties with which we conduct business are also working from home, working at reduced staffing levels and dealing with other challenges, such as supply chain disruptions and revised budgets, that are forcing them to conduct business in different ways. The extent to which these parties suffer inefficiencies or other risks from these different arrangements, and the extent to which these risks may impact us, is impossible to predict. In addition, as long as the pandemic continues, our employees may be exposed to health risks. Our efforts to re-open our offices safely may expose our employees, customers and other third parties to health risks and us to associated liability, and doing so is likely to involve additional financial burdens, and we may experience disruptions to our business as employees return, or resist returning, to working from our offices. The COVID-19 pandemic may have long-term effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working. This may present operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to sustain our recent revenue growth rate in the future, and, if the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and consumers revert to pre-pandemic shopping habits, our business could contract rapidly.\nWe have experienced significant growth during 2020, with our paid customers and mailing and shipping revenue increasing by 25.7% and 33.9%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Our recent growth has been significantly impacted by an increasing demand for our platform and products following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting precautionary measures including stay-at-home and shelter-in-place policies. As the impact of COVID-19 lessens, there may be reduced demand for our platform, and our revenue growth rate may decline and even turn negative. If these new customers elect not to continue their subscription as the impact of COVID-19 lessens, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nAs a result of our limited operating history at our current scale, our ability to forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties. You should not rely on our recent revenue growth rate or the revenue growth rate of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance; moreover, we believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our recent growth rate makes attempts to extrapolate future performance from past results particularly problematic. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth rate could slow, or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our platform, increased competition, higher market penetration, a contraction of our overall market, our inability to accurately forecast demand for our platform and plan for capacity constraints or our failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth opportunities. If our revenue growth rate declines, investors\u2019 perceptions of our business and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect the businesses of our business partners, including carriers and integration partners, and customers, which, in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow.\nAmong other things, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause our carrier partners, who are critical business partners to us, to experience reduced or unmanageably increased volume, higher costs, tighter margins, or greater difficulty obtaining the equipment and labor necessary to operate their businesses. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may result in: (i) shippers reducing their volumes; (ii) shippers increasing their volumes to levels which our carrier partners cannot handle without additional effort and expense or at all; (iii) carriers implementing more expensive protocols for package pick-up, handling and delivery, the costs of which they may not be able to pass on to their customers; and (iv) carriers\u2019 personnel being unwilling to perform their jobs at their current rates, or at all, or insisting on health and safety measures that impair the profitability of the carriers\u2019 operations. Similarly, the pandemic may cause our integration partners or customers to lose business, experience unmanageable spikes in demand or suffer disruptions and expenses in managing employee health and safety. If our business partners or customers feel any such impacts, then our volume, revenue and profitability may likewise be adversely affected.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate many of the other risks facing our company, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic interacts with the other risks facing our company including those that are described throughout the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section this report. Developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been rapidly changing, and additional impacts and risks may arise that we are not aware of or able to appropriately respond to currently.\nAmong other things, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting action by governments, individuals and/or organizations, and the ensuing economic consequences, may exacerbate Risk Factors included in this Report, including as described below:\n\u2022Trade restrictions have been, and may be, imposed by governments in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and consumers are or may become reluctant, due to concerns over COVID-19, to order goods that will be shipped across international borders or from particular regions;\n\u2022The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could lead to regional and/or global recessions and unrest and impair the creditworthiness and ability to pay of our customers;\n\u2022The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may lead to employee attrition, whether due to the disease itself or an unwillingness to perform certain job functions for fear of contracting or spreading the disease, and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d requirements may make it more difficult to recruit and review candidates for open positions;\n\u2022If the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic results in a significant reduction or failure of small businesses in the US, that could both increase our subscription cancellations and decrease our acquisition of new customers;\n\u2022Responding to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may consume large portions of the capacity of many of our existing and potential future business partners, making it more difficult or impossible to renew existing agreements and/or enter into new agreements with such partners;\n\u2022If the COVID-19 pandemic results in carriers whose services can be accessed through our technologies losing market share to carriers whose services cannot be so accessed, or can but less profitably for us, then our results of operations will be adversely affected;\n\u2022To the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic interrupts the products and services we receive from our third party suppliers and outsourcing vendors and we are unable to find alternate suppliers, then we could experience disruptions in operations and/or higher costs;\n\u2022In the event our integration partners experience reduced activity and/or go out of business as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our agreements with them may generate less revenue to us and/or be terminated;\n\u2022To the extent the financial stability and creditworthiness of customers to whom we offer invoicing and extend credit terms is adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we may be unable to collect amounts due from such customers; and\n\u2022To the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic disrupts global credit and capital markets, we may encounter more difficult market conditions should we seek to raise financing through the issuance of equity or debt (including, without limitation should we seek to refinance our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement maturing in June 2022), which could adversely affect our ability to withstand any cash-flow difficulties or to engage in strategic transactions that could be beneficial to us.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nIf we are unable to protect our information technology systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation may be harmed and we could be subject to legal and/or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nWe depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems to support numerous business processes and activities. In addition, we must provide a high level of security for the transactions we execute. We rely on internally developed and third party technology to provide secure transmission of postage and other valuable and/or confidential information. Any breach of these security measures would severely impact our business and reputation and would likely result in the loss of customers and revenues. Furthermore, if we fail to provide adequate security, the USPS could prohibit us from selling postage over the Internet and other existing and prospective partners could refuse to work with us.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of sources, including fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquakes and similar events. Our Internet host provider does not guarantee that our Internet access will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical, electrical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. We have experienced system interruptions in the past which have not been material and may experience similar or larger system interruptions again in the future. In addition, we are susceptible to system and operational disruptions caused by substantial changes to the demand for our services and surges in the use of our service by customers. Any substantial system interruptions in the future, whatever the cause, could result in the loss of data and could completely impair our ability to generate revenues from our service.\nOur servers also periodically experience directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service. Among other things, any breach of our information technology security could result in the unauthorized disclosure, theft or misuse of sensitive and confidential information regarding the company, our strategic partners, our customers and our employees. Any attempts to disrupt our service or our internal systems, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. Additionally, we could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, governmental inquiries, investigations or regulatory enforcement actions, our brand and reputation damaged, and we could be subject to the payment of fines or other penalties, legal claims and significant remediation costs.\nOur insurance may not be sufficient to cover expenses related to system and operational disruptions or attacks on our website, servers or internal systems. We do not presently have a full disaster recovery plan in effect to cover the loss of all facilities and equipment. We cannot be certain that our business interruption insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of business interruptions.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the collection of credit card information and other customer data and the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, and our potential liability as well as the costs we may incur to mitigate such risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our customer transactions requires the collection of customer data, such as credit card information. We and other parties involved in processing customer transactions must be able to transmit confidential information, including credit card information, securely over public networks. Third parties may have the technology or knowledge to breach the security of customer transaction data. Although we have security measures related to our systems and the privacy of our customers, we cannot guarantee these measures will effectively prevent others from obtaining unauthorized access to our information and our customers\u2019 information. Any person who circumvents our security measures could destroy or steal valuable information and/or disrupt our operations.\nWe experience attempted cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our vendors, or otherwise. Such breach or unauthorized access, increased government surveillance, or attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our websites, products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If\nan actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.\nAny security breach could also expose us to risks of data loss, litigation and liability, and could seriously disrupt operations and harm our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, state and federal laws and regulations are increasingly enacted to protect consumers against identity theft. These laws and regulations will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to implement appropriate security measures, or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws and regulations, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a multitude of privacy and cyber security laws, including the EU's GDPR, California's CCPA and those of other jurisdictions, which may affect our operations and expose us to potential liability.\nWe control and process large amounts of personally identifiable information, including that of our customers, our partners and their respective customers. Our exposure to financial and reputational risks under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has significantly increased as a result of our expanding European operations, in particular due to our Metapack acquisition. Even without any cyber event or data breach, we incur significant compliance costs.\nThe EU has adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the national legislative approach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the GDPR, which became effective in 2018. The EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and \u20ac20 million and includes new rights such as the \u201cportability\u201d of personal data. Although the GDPR applies across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, local data protection authorities (DPAs) still have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. Our exposure to financial and reputational risks under the GDPR has significantly increased as a result of expanding our European operations, in particular due to our Metapack acquisition.\nThe GDPR generally prohibits the transfer of personal data of EU subjects outside of the EU, unless a lawful data transfer solution has been implemented or a data transfer derogation applies. On July 16, 2020, in a case known as Schrems II, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled on the validity of two of the primary data transfer solutions. The first method, EU-US Privacy Shield operated by the US Department of Commerce, was declared invalid as a legal mechanism to transfer data from the EU to the US As a result, that mechanism may no longer be relied upon as a lawful means to transfer EU personal data to the US. For the time being, however, the Department of Commerce continues to operate the EU-US Privacy Shield, and if we fail to comply with the Privacy Shield requirements we risk investigation and sanction by US regulatory authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission. Such investigation could cost us significant time and resources, and could potentially result in fines, criminal prosecution, or other penalties.\nThe second mechanism, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), an alternative transfer measure for the transfer of personal data out of the EU, was upheld as a valid legal mechanism for transnational data transfer. However, the ruling requires that organizations seeking to rely on the SCCs to export data out of the EU ensure the data is protected to a standard that is \"essentially equivalent\" to that in the EU including, where necessary, by taking \"supplementary measures\" to protect the data. It remains unclear what \"supplementary measures\" must be taken to allow the lawful transfer of personal data to the United States, and it is possible that EU data protection authorities may determine that there are no supplementary measures that can legitimize EU to US personal data transfers. For the time being, we rely on SCCs for transfer of European Economic Area (EEA) and UK personal data to the US and explore what \u201csupplementary measures\u201d can be implemented to protect such personal data that is transferred to us in the US\nIn the event that use of the SCCs is subsequently invalidated as a solution for data transfers to the US or there are additional changes to the data protection regime in the EU resulting in any inability to transfer personal data from the EU to the US in compliance with data protection laws, European partners and customers may be more inclined to work with businesses that do not rely on such compliance mechanisms to ensure legal and regulatory compliance, such as EU-based companies or other competitors that do not need to transfer personal data to the US in\norder to avoid the above-identified risks and legal issues. Such changes could cause us to incur penalties under GDPR and could increase the cost and complexity of operating our business.\nWe may also need to restructure our data transfer practices as a result of Brexit. Since the end of 2020, EU law no longer applies to the UK. This means that data may not be able to flow freely between the EEA and the UK and our UK subsidiaries may have to enter into the SCCs, and implement \u201csupplementary measures\u201d in order to ensure the continuing flow of data to and from the UK.\nThe state of California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, a privacy and cyber security law, which establishes strict data protection and privacy controls and reporting requirements and increases liabilities for non-compliance. In addition, other jurisdictions, including other states, have enacted, or may enact, their own privacy and cyber security laws. Any such laws may impact our operations and the California legislation underscores the increasing risk profile of our business to both cyber events and the emerging, strict, regulatory framework governing all businesses dealing in personal data.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws.\nRegulations and/or USPS policy or practices may cause disruptions to, or the discontinuance of our business.\nWe are subject to continued USPS scrutiny and other government regulations. The availability of our services is dependent upon us continuing to meet USPS performance specifications and regulations. The USPS could change its certification requirements or specifications for PC Postage or other programs or revoke or suspend the approval of one or more of our services or those of our third party service providers at any time. If at any time we fail to meet USPS requirements, we may be prohibited from offering our services, and our business would be severely and negatively impacted. In addition, the USPS could suspend or terminate our approval or offer services that compete against us, any of which could stop or negatively impact the commercial adoption of our services. Any changes in requirements or specifications for PC Postage could adversely affect our pricing, cost of revenues, operating results and margins by increasing the cost of providing our services.\nOur business is subject to regulation by other federal, state and foreign government agencies and our failure to comply, or allegations thereof, could restrict our ability to generate revenue, require us to pay fines and/or disgorge certain profits, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe USPS could also decide that PC Postage should no longer be an approved postage service due to security concerns, financial difficulties within the USPS or other issues. Our business would suffer dramatically if we were unable to promptly adapt our services to any new requirements or specifications or if the USPS were to discontinue PC Postage as an approved postage method. Alternatively, the USPS could introduce competitive programs or amend PC Postage requirements to make certification easier to obtain, which could lead to more competition from third parties or the USPS itself. If we are unable to compete successfully, particularly against large, traditional providers of postage products, such as Pitney Bowes, who entered the online postage market, our revenues and operating results will suffer.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, the USPS revoked our permission to offer customized postage products, effective June 16, 2020. As a result, we discontinued selling customized postage products, including our PhotoStamps product, and have not earned any customized postage revenue since the second quarter of 2020. Such revenues accounted for 2.6% of our total revenues in 2019 and 3.3% in the first six months of 2020. This decision by the USPS followed the filing of a lawsuit against the USPS by a third party alleging 1st Amendment religious expression harm as a result of the USPS published regulations regarding customized postage. The USPS thereafter decided to end the customized postage program. Actions by the USPS like this, or other similar actions which may be harmful to our business interests and services, are beyond our ability to control.\nIn addition, USPS regulations may require that our personnel with access to postal information or resources receive security clearance prior to doing relevant work. We may experience delays or disruptions if our personnel\ncannot receive necessary security clearances in a timely manner, or at all. The regulations may limit our ability to hire qualified personnel. For example, sensitive clearance may only be provided to US citizens or aliens who are specifically approved to work on USPS projects.\nFinally, any approved USPS market test or new service that benefits us could also ultimately be suspended or cancelled by the USPS, causing disruptions to our business.\nPostal reform may negatively affect, or cause disruptions to, our services and business, and could adversely affect our ability to compete and our results of operations.\nThe USPS has reached its congressionally mandated debt limit and faces ongoing fiscal liquidity issues. The USPS currently has four vacancies on its Board of Governors. It has embarked on cost cutting initiatives and has asked Congress to enact various Postal Reform measures. Newly appointed Governors, including the two that were appointed in 2018, the three that were appointed in 2019 and the one appointed in 2020, could change the focus of cost cutting initiatives. Among the measures discussed are cutbacks in delivery schedules and locations, mail processing capability, and retail post office hours and locations. Any such changes actually approved and implemented, or the perception that such changes are forthcoming, may adversely affect the attractiveness of the USPS products and services we are able to offer our customers and could therefore seriously harm the competitiveness of our business. Additionally, absent Congressional action, any USPS fiscal crisis could interrupt basic USPS operations, as well as payments to USPS suppliers such as us, each of which could also seriously harm our business.\nOur operating results could be impaired if we, or the Internet generally, become subject to additional government regulation.\nChanges in the laws and regulations applicable to the Internet or us, including those relating to user privacy, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, characteristics and quality of products and services, and export controls, could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the applicability of existing laws to the Internet is uncertain with regard to many issues, including property ownership, export of specialized technology, sales tax, state income taxes, libel and personal privacy, and changes in their interpretation could similarly harm us. The application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and other online services could also harm our business.\nWe have employees and offer our services in multiple states and internationally. These or other jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each state or foreign country. Our failure to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so could subject us to taxes and penalties. Other states and foreign countries may also attempt to regulate our services or prosecute us for actual or perceived violations of their laws.\nOur business is subject to extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations, and our results of operations, financial condition and reputation may be adversely affected by the demands of compliance and/or by our liability for any failure to comply.\nOur business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate and where our customers reside, including, but not limited to, those governing privacy, data protection and consumer protection. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws and regulations), including without limitation those discussed in this risk factor or in other risk factors, may:\n\u2022subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions;\n\u2022result in additional compliance and licensure requirements;\n\u2022increase regulatory scrutiny of our business;\n\u2022restrict our operations; and\n\u2022force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements.\nThe complexity of US federal, state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, among other things, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to a number of laws, rules and directives (which we refer to as \u201cprivacy laws\u201d) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as \u201cprocess\u201d) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as \u201cpersonal data\u201d) in the jurisdictions where we have operations and where our users reside. Much of the personal data that we process is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. See \u201c- We are subject to a multitude of privacy and cyber security laws, including the EU\u2019s GDPR, California\u2019s CCPA and those of other jurisdictions, which may affect our operations and expose us to potential liability,\u201d above.\nThere is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers. A determination that there have been violations of privacy or data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by consolidation and/or vertical integration by our competitors, carriers, partners and potential customers.\nThe consolidation or vertical integration of our competitors, carriers, partners or customers may result in the loss of contracts or impact demand or competition for our products and services. Any changes that affect our customers\u2019 shipping and mailing technology purchasing practices may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Many of these entities are significantly larger than we are (or through consolidation may suddenly grow much larger), have greater financial and other resources and also have the ability to purchase products and services from our competitors and/or to develop their own competitive offerings. As a result of their size and position in the marketplace, some of our partners and customers have significant leverage and could cause us to materially reduce margins on our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCarriers whose services we offer to our customers, could fail to compete successfully with existing or future competitors, resulting in reduced demand for our products and services.\nThe carriers whose services we offer to our customers, including the USPS, are critical business partners to us. However, we do not control and cannot predict the business decisions of our critical business partners, or their current or future competitors. One or more such carriers may suffer a sudden or gradual erosion of their competitiveness in the shipping and mailing market. Such loss of competitiveness may result from their own actions or inactions in their perceived self-interest, actions or inactions by third-parties, political pressure or governmental incentives, or for other reasons entirely. Furthermore, other competitors may successfully win business from the carriers whose services we offer to our customers. If the carriers whose services we offer fail to compete successfully with carriers whose services we do not offer (or whose services we do offer, but on terms less favorable to us), then we would suffer reduced demand for (or profitability from) our products and services, and our results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against alternative methods of accessing relevant mailing and shipping services, our revenues and operating results will suffer.\nWe compete with all of the alternate ways that consumers and businesses may access mailing and shipping services from the USPS, including the following: online services available at USPS.com; USPS retail locations; USPS kiosks; multi-carrier solutions; integrated web shipping solutions such as eBay/PayPal or Amazon.com; traditional postage meters; other USPS-approved PC Postage vendors; USPS permit manifesting solutions; and commercial retail locations that sell postage or shipping services (for example grocery stores, discount warehouses, small business mailing and shipping centers, office supply chains, and others). Some of these alternative means of accessing USPS services are available with no additional markup over the face value of postage and some are available with discounted postage rates that are better than the discounts that we are able to provide to our customers. We also compete with all of the alternate ways that consumers and businesses may access the mailing and shipping services of carriers other than the USPS, including multi-carrier solutions providers. We also compete with the technology solutions available from these carriers themselves, which allow customers to access those carriers, and which are typically provided to the customers for no additional fees.\nWe may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors as they enter the market. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, greater financial, marketing, service, support, technical, intellectual property and other resources than us. As a result, our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development. This increased competition may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and a diminished brand. We may from time to time make pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment. These actions could result in reduced margins and seriously harm our business.\nWe face competitive pressures from new technologies or the expansion of existing technologies approved for use by the USPS and other carriers. We may also face competition from a number of indirect competitors that specialize in electronic commerce and other companies with substantial customer bases in the computer and other technical fields. Additionally, companies that control access to transactions through a network or web browsers could also promote our competitors or charge us a substantial fee for inclusion. In addition, changes in postal regulations could adversely affect our service and significantly impact our competitive position. For example, in 2018, Amazon launched a delivery service that is designed to compete directly with carriers such as the USPS, UPS, FedEx and others. By leveraging a large customer base and substantial resources, Amazon and/or other companies (including, among others, well-resourced e-commerce platforms that have thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic and may compete with us as they seek greater vertical integration) may be able to win substantial market share at the expense of other carriers and the technology and service providers that support them, including the Company and its subsidiaries. We may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and the competitive pressures we face could seriously harm our business.\nIf we do not respond effectively to technological and market changes, our services and products could become obsolete and our business will suffer.\nThe development of our services, products and other technology entails significant technical and business risks. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our online operations. The Internet and the electronic commerce industry are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user and customer requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices.\nThe evolving nature of the Internet or the markets in which we operate could render our existing technology and systems obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our abilities:\n\u2022to develop, license or acquire leading technologies useful in our business;\n\u2022to enhance our existing services;\n\u2022to develop new services or features and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective users; and\n\u2022to respond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWith the growth of e-commerce, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the shipping and logistics industries is faster now than in years past. This accelerated pace of change increases uncertainty and places a greater burden on management to anticipate and respond to such changes. The increased pace of change also means that the window in which a technologically advanced or sophisticated product or service can achieve and maintain partner and consumer interest is shrinking and, to the extent we fail to timely anticipate or respond to changes in our industry, the effects of such missteps may be amplified and our business seriously harmed.\nFuture advances in technology may not be beneficial to, or compatible with, our business. Furthermore, we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our technology and systems to user requirements or emerging industry standards on a timely basis. Our ability to remain technologically competitive may require substantial expenditures and lead time. If we are unable to adapt in a timely manner and at reasonable cost to changing market conditions or user requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nThe discontinuation of certain financial compensation arrangements with the USPS will have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results, unless we are successful in replacing the lost revenue and profit with similar compensation from the USPS or other potential partners, of which there is no assurance.\nAs previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2018, the USPS provided a notice requiring the renegotiation of certain important financial compensation arrangements, and our negotiations with the USPS resulted in the discontinuation of the aforementioned arrangements effective December 31, 2018. As a result, and as previously disclosed, our revenue and operating results will continue to be adversely affected unless we are successful in timely replacing the lost revenue with similar compensation from the USPS or other potential partners. There is no assurance as to when, if or to what extent we may ultimately succeed in implementing mitigating strategies, all of which carry negotiation and execution risks. Unless and until we replace these lost revenues and associated profit margins, our operating results may be materially less than in previous years.\nCarriers could modify, discontinue or terminate agreements and other financial compensation arrangements, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nCarriers could decide to amend, renegotiate, discontinue or terminate one or more financial compensation arrangements from which we benefit that exist now or in the future. For example, if the USPS decides to amend, renegotiate, discontinue or terminate any of our agreements or our integration partners\u2019 agreements under which we are compensated directly or indirectly by the USPS or integration partners for shipping customers who print certain classes of postage, or our credit card cost sharing agreements which govern the allocation of credit card fees paid by the USPS and us, then our revenue and operating results would suffer. In the history of our relationship with the USPS, we have had many of these important agreements renewed only on short-term extensions and without assurances of any long-term commitments by the USPS. More recently, certain important financial compensation arrangements with the USPS were neither renewed nor extended at the end of their terms (see \"- The discontinuation of certain compensation arrangements with the USPS will have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results, unless we are successful in replacing the lost revenue and profit with similar compensation from the USPS or other potential partners, of which there is no assurance,\" above). We expect continued uncertainty as to these compensation arrangements going forward, and, whether or not ultimately renewed, there could be prolonged periods where we operate without such agreements, which would have an adverse impact on our operating results. Similarly, the financial compensation arrangements we have or may enter into with other carriers may be amended, renegotiated, discontinued or terminated. If any of these financial compensation arrangements are not renewed, or if renegotiation leads to renewal on materially less favorable terms, then our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected.\nCarriers or our integration partners could cause discounts our customers receive to be diminished or terminated, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, reputation and competitiveness.\nCarriers, including the USPS, could decide to amend or terminate the discounts our customers and integration partners receive. Customers using our services receive discounted postage rates, either from Stamps.com or from integration partners that provide discounted rates, compared to USPS retail rates on certain mail pieces such as First Class letters and packages, domestic and international Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express packages, and other\ndiscounts available to high-volume shipping customers. We also earn compensation by offering customers a discounted postage rate that is provided to the customers by our integration partners. If the USPS decides to withdraw certain discounts or even remove the discounts entirely, our revenue and operating results will suffer. If the Postal Regulatory Commission decides the discounts are unlawful and require the USPS to cancel or change them, then our revenue and operating results would suffer. These discounts are subject to terms and conditions of agreements between third parties and the USPS, and there can be no assurance that our integration partners will continue to have access to such discounts or that they will continue to make them available to our customers on favorable terms or at all. Similarly, other carriers may amend or terminate the discounts our customers and/or integration partners receive now or in the future. Any disruption to our ability to provide discounts to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, reputation and competitiveness.\nStrategic business and integration partners, including e-commerce technology platforms and carriers, could modify or terminate commercial agreements, strategic alliances, compensation arrangements and other relationships, including with third parties, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects.\nStrategic business partners, such as the USPS, other postal services, multi-carrier software providers, e-commerce platforms, private shipping services, shipping service resellers, or others, could decide to amend, renegotiate or terminate agreements or financial compensation arrangements that exist now or in the future. For instance, if these partners amend, renegotiate or terminate agreements allowing us to integrate their services with our products and services, our revenues and operating results could suffer and our ability to attract customers that rely on these services could suffer.\nWe have partnership agreements with many integration partners in the high volume shipping area of our business. These partners integrate our mailing and shipping services into their offerings and provide customers that use our services through their products. The modification or termination of any of these agreements by us or our partners could result in lost customers, reduced postage printed and lost revenue and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on e-commerce technology platforms, such as marketplaces, app stores, electronic shopping carts, payment solutions, and web store platforms, among others, to reach certain customers and promote the sale of our products and services. If popular e-commerce technology platforms adopt restrictive policies or take any other actions that would restrict or prohibit our ability to integrate with those platforms to sell our products and services, or increase our cost of sales or the price to consumers of our products and services, then it will make our products and services less useful to our customers and potential customers, and as a result, our business and operating results will suffer. While we rely on such third parties to introduce customers and generate sales through e-commerce channels, we do not necessarily have long-term contracts with such third parties, and it is possible that such third parties may decide not to contract with us in the future on reasonable terms or at all, or to terminate their existing contracts with us. Further, such third parties may offer products and services that compete with ours. If any such events occur, we may suffer decreasing paid customers and revenue from operations.\nWe depend on third party suppliers and outsource providers, and our business and results could be adversely affected if we fail to manage these vendors effectively.\nWe depend on third party suppliers and outsource providers for a variety of services, components and supplies, including carrier services whether offered under third party brands or our own branding, and certain asset-intensive portions of our logistics business. In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers and outsourcing vendors because doing so is advantageous due to quality, price or lack of alternative sources. If production or services were interrupted and we were not able to find alternate third party suppliers, we could experience disruptions in operations including higher service costs. If outsourcing services were interrupted, not performed, or the performance was poor, our ability to process, record and report transactions with our customers, integration partners and other counterparties could be impacted. Such interruptions in the provision of supplies and/or services could impact our ability to meet customer demand, damage our reputation and relationships and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nIf we fail to effectively market and sell our services and products, our business will be substantially harmed and could fail.\nIn order to acquire customers and achieve widespread distribution and use of our services and products, we must develop and execute cost-effective marketing campaigns and sales programs. We currently rely on a\ncombination of marketing techniques to attract new customers including direct mail, online marketing and business partnerships. We may be unable to continue marketing our services and products in a cost-effective manner. If we fail to acquire customers in a cost-effective manner, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe may not successfully implement strategies to increase the adoption of our services and products, which would limit our growth, adversely affect our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur continuing profitability depends on our ability to successfully implement our strategy of increasing the adoption of our services and products. Factors that might cause our revenues, margins and operating results to fluctuate include the factors described below in this section as well as:\n\u2022the costs of our marketing programs to establish and promote our brands;\n\u2022the demand for our services and products;\n\u2022our ability to develop and maintain strategic distribution relationships; the number, timing and significance of new products or services introduced by us and by our competitors;\n\u2022our ability to develop, market and introduce new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis;\n\u2022the level of service and price competition;\n\u2022our operating expenses;\n\u2022USPS regulation and policies relating to PC Postage;\n\u2022the modification or termination of financial compensation arrangements with the USPS, strategic business partners and other carriers; and\n\u2022general economic factors.\nIf we fail to meet and anticipate the demands of our current and prospective customers or to further develop and upgrade our services and products, our business will be substantially harmed and could fail.\nOur services and products must meet the commercial demands of our customers, which include small businesses, home offices, medium-size businesses, large enterprises, e-commerce merchants, large retailers and high volume shippers including warehouses, fulfillment houses and omni-channel retailers. We cannot be sure that our services will appeal to or be adopted by an ever-growing range of customers. If we are unable to ship products such as items from our supplies store in a timely manner to our customers, our business may be harmed. Moreover, our ability to obtain and retain customers depends, in part, on our customer service capabilities. If we are unable at any time to address customer service issues adequately or to provide a satisfactory customer experience for current or potential customers, our business and reputation may be harmed. If we fail to meet the demands of our customers, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe must minimize the rate of loss of existing customers while adding new customers. Customers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently. Also customers may feel the costs for service are too high, they may be going out of business, or they may have other issues that are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new customers both to replace customers who cancel and to continue to grow our business beyond our current customer base. If too many of our customers cancel our service, or if we are unable to attract new customers in numbers sufficient to grow our business, our operating results will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of customers cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to seek to replace these customers with new customers.\nAny delays or failures in developing our services and products, including upgrades of current services and products, may have a harmful impact on our results of operations. The need to extend our core technologies, and those of the companies we acquire, into new features and services and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect our ability to develop these services and features. Delays in features or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price. We cannot determine the ultimate effect these delays or the introduction of new features or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations.\nWe may implement pricing plans and promotions that may adversely affect our future revenues and margins.\nOur ability to generate gross margins depends upon our ability to generate significant revenues from a large base of active customers. In order to attract customers in the future, we may run special promotions and offers, such as trial periods, discounts on fees, offers of postage and/or supplies, and other promotions. In addition, we may offer new pricing plans for new and existing customers. We cannot be sure that customers will be receptive to future fee structures and special promotions that we may implement. Even though we have established a sizeable customer base, we still may not generate sufficient gross margins to remain profitable. In addition, our ability to generate revenues or sustain profitability could be adversely affected by the special promotions or additional changes to our pricing plans.\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and other business relationships or in expanding into new products, services, technologies and geographic regions.\nWe provide e-commerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, shipping, mailing, and other services. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company\u2019s sales. Therefore, if the other company\u2019s offering is not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.\nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:\n\u2022disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n\u2022impairment of other relationships;\n\u2022variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\n\u2022difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.\nOur expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks. We may have limited or no experience in our newer markets, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining acquisitions and investments.\nWe have acquired a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions create risks such as:\n\u2022disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n\u2022problems retaining key personnel;\n\u2022additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;\n\u2022the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;\n\u2022the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations;\n\u2022the potential impairment of our existing business relationships resulting from our existing business partners' perception that a newly acquired business or investment may compete with or otherwise harm them;\n\u2022the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;\n\u2022the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\u2022the difficulty of integrating a new company\u2019s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;\n\u2022for investments in which an investee\u2019s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on the investee\u2019s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;\n\u2022the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;\n\u2022the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and\n\u2022for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nAs a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur expansion places a significant strain on our management, operational, financial, and other resources.\nWe have significantly expanded our global operations with our Metapack acquisition, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our services' businesses. This expansion, as well as any further or other expansion, increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur European operations, including those of our Metapack business, could be adversely impacted by Brexit.\nIn June 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" On March 29, 2017, the UK notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The UK exited the European Union on January 31, 2020. The UK\u2019s membership of the EU single market ended on December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the UK and the EU announced that they had struck a new bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the UK and the EU (the \u201cEU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d) which was formally approved by the 27 member states of the EU on December 29, 2020. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was formally approved by the UK parliament on December 30, 2020 and, as of the date of this Report, has not been ratified by the EU parliament.\nBrexit has caused, and the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement may continue to result in, significant volatility in global stock market and currency exchange rate fluctuations of the US dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business. Ongoing changes in the EU's regulatory framework applicable to our business, including changes related to Brexit and any other changes in the composition of the EU's member states, may add further complexity to our global risks and operations.\nGiven the significant UK presence we have after acquiring Metapack, we could be adversely impacted by Brexit, any failure of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement to be ratified and/or the Trade and Cooperation Agreement itself. In particular, any outcome that negatively impacts the ability of UK based businesses to deliver services to EU member states, or that increases the costs of such service delivery, would likely have an adverse impact on our business. For example, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries and increased regulatory complexities. These changes may adversely affect our sales, operations and financial results. Further, our operations in the UK may be adversely affected by extreme fluctuations in UK exchange rates. Moreover, the imposition of any import restrictions and duties levied on our UK services as imported for EU customers may make our service more expensive for such customers and less competitive from pricing and speed and/or reliability of delivery and perspectives. Similarly, import restrictions and duties levied on the products shipped by our UK customers to the EU may make such products less competitive and result in lower shipping volume and reduced use of our shipping solutions.\nGiven the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear how Brexit may negatively impact the economies of the UK, the EU member states and other nations. However, any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nGeopolitical uncertainty, and changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, import and excise duties, taxes or other governmental rules and regulations could reduce cross-border trade or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are seeking to grow our revenue generated from customers located outside the US and, after acquiring Metapack, a significant portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the US Risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, include:\n\u2022political instability, and the possibility of deteriorating relationships involving countries in which we operate;\n\u2022the imposition of new or modified international trade restrictions, tariffs, import and excise duties or other taxes;\n\u2022import and export requirements, including restrictions on sales to certain end customers;\n\u2022restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, including potential intervention by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) or by other applicable administrative review boards to block strategic transactions that might otherwise be in shareholders\u2019 interests;\n\u2022restrictions on repatriation of cash earned in foreign countries;\n\u2022changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;\n\u2022a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which, among other things, can create uncertainty regarding contract enforcement, intellectual property rights and liability issues; and\n\u2022inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nThe US federal government or other governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. Any changes to the international trading system, or the emergence or escalation of an international trade dispute, could significantly impact our business and have a negative impact on our revenues. In addition, the US and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties, tariffs and other taxes on our products in varying amounts. Any significant increases in import and\nexcise duties or other taxes on our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWe engage in cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) in the ordinary course of our business. Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws applicable to cross-border trade could impose additional requirements (which may impose conflicting obligations) and restrictions on cross-border trade and increase the costs associated with cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade or restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business.\nTo the extent our e-commerce business expands globally, we may be subject to increased customs and regulatory risks from cross-border transactions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nTo the extent we expand our operations to include international sales generated by customers processing transactions through our platform, our international e-commerce business will be subject to significant trade regulations, taxes, and duties in the applicable jurisdictions. Our growing exposure, as well as any changes, to these regulations could potentially impose increased documentation and delivery requirements on us, increase our costs, delay delivery times, and subject us to additional liabilities, each of which could diminish our ability to compete in international markets and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nSales generated from our customers\u2019 internationally focused businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. A strengthening of the currency in which we price our products and services (currently US Dollars) relative to the currencies in other countries where we do business impacts our ability to compete internationally as the cost of similar international products and services priced in other currencies improve relative to the cost of our US Dollar-denominated products and services. Such an exchange rate driven increase in our prices would likely result in a decrease in international volumes, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Alternatively, if we price our international products and services sales in local currencies, a relative strengthening of the US Dollar would result in lower reported revenues from such international sales.\nWe have foreign exchange risk.\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds and Euros. If the US Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\nIf we do not successfully attract and retain skilled personnel for permanent management and other key personnel positions, we may not be able to effectively implement our business plan.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of the members of our senior management and other key personnel, including software developers and other technology specialists who are in particularly high demand in the markets where we are located. Any of these individuals can terminate his or her employment with us at any time. If we lose key employees and are unable to replace them with qualified individuals, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. In addition, our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel. We may be unable to successfully attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel. Further, we may be unable to retain the employees we currently employ or attract additional qualified personnel to replace those key employees that may depart. The failure to attract and retain the necessary personnel could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird party assertions of violations of their intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nSubstantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry. Third parties may currently have, or may eventually be issued, patents upon which our products or technology infringe. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us. We may become aware of, or we may increasingly receive correspondence claiming, potential infringement of other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. We could incur significant costs and diversion of management time and resources to defend claims against us, regardless of their validity. Any associated costs (including settlement costs, judgments and legal expenses) and business distractions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, litigation in which we are accused of infringement might cause product development delays, require us to develop non-infringing technology or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements, which might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business could be significantly harmed or fail. Any loss resulting from intellectual property litigation could severely limit our operations, cause us to pay license fees, or prevent us from doing business.\nA failure to protect our own intellectual property could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our rights in our products, services, know-how and information. We have a portfolio of issued and pending US and international patents. We also have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We plan to apply for more patents in the future. We may not receive patents for any of our patent applications. Even if patents are issued to us, claims issued in these patents may not protect our technology. In addition, a court might hold any of our patents, trademarks or service marks invalid or unenforceable. Even if our patents are upheld or are not challenged, the costs of enforcing our patents can be material, and third parties may develop alternative technologies or products without infringing our patents. If our patents fail to protect our technology or our trademarks and service marks are successfully challenged, our competitive position could be harmed. We also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties to control and limit access to, and disclosure of, our confidential information. These contractual arrangements or other steps taken to protect our intellectual property may not prove to be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of technology or deter independent third party development of similar technologies. Additionally, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our services or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nPending or future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nLitigation is uncertain, and the outcome of individual cases is often not predictable with any degree of certainty. We establish loss provisions only for matters in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. If either or both of the criteria are not met, we assess whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss, or additional losses, may have been incurred. If there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred for such proceedings, we disclose the estimate of the amount of loss or possible range of loss, or disclose that an estimate of loss cannot be made, as applicable. We are currently a defendant in several cases including securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation for which we have not reserved any loss provision, since neither the likelihood that a loss, if any, will be realized, nor an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss, if any, can be determined. Any award or settlement in such cases in excess of applicable insurance coverage would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Future litigation could involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, or sanctions, that, if awarded could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could exceed any loss provisions we may have established, any available insurance that we have for such claims, or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Future litigation could also involve injunctive relief, where a court could prohibit, or materially restrict, our ability to compete in certain businesses or opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results. For information concerning material litigation in which we are involved, please see the \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d section in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Report.\nIncreases in payment processing fees would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur customers pay for our services using credit cards and debit cards and by use of automated clearing house payments. Our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees. From time to time, these fees may increase, either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result of a change in our business practices that increase the fees on a cost-per-transaction basis. If these fees for accepting payment methods increase in future periods, it would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA decline in our ability to effectively bill our customers by credit card and debit card would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to effectively charge our customers through credit cards and debit cards is subject to many variables, including our own billing technology and practices, the practices and rules of payment processing companies, and the practices and rules of issuing financial institutions. Although certain pass-through charges, such as for USPS postage, do not appear as revenue in our financial statements, any payment processing fees associated with those charges can be very large in relation to the profitability of the associated transactions to us, if any. If we do not effectively charge and bill our customers in future periods through credit cards and debit cards, it would adversely affect our results of operations.\nCredit card fraud and our response to it could adversely affect our business.\nWe routinely receive orders placed with fraudulent credit card data. We do not carry insurance against the risk of credit card fraud, so our failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions could reduce our net revenues and our profit. We may suffer losses as a result of postage purchases placed with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved payment. If we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud, our liability for these transactions could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Further, to the extent our efforts to prevent fraudulent transactions result in our inadvertent refusal to fill legitimate business requests, we would lose the benefit of legitimate potential sales and risk the alienation of legitimate customers.\nDefault on the credit we may provide for printing postage to one or more of our larger customers could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs we acquire larger customers that require larger postage volumes to support their businesses, we offer invoicing and extend credit terms to certain of these customers to facilitate their access to postage and use of our services. If one or more of these customers were to default on amounts owed, it could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and fund our other capital requirements, our liquidity and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur level of indebtedness could have significant effects on our business. For example, our current liabilities and any indebtedness we may incur in the future, including under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement could:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other elements of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and payment of dividends;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022make it more likely that we experience an event of default or other event that could result in the acceleration of our obligations to repay our indebtedness;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022adversely affect our financial results as the interest rate on our current debt is subject to changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or any applicable successor benchmark rate and changes in certain financial measures, and the interest rate on any indebtedness we may incur in the future may be subject to similar interest rate changes and thus could increase in future periods. The LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past, and while we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to the 2021 target date, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, and they could include an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in our interest income.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and to fund working capital, capital expenditures and investments in our business, will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. For example, this could include general and regional economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. We cannot ensure that we will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional indebtedness or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to timely effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur Amended and Restated Credit Agreement imposes certain limitations on our ability to make dividend payments and to engage in further borrowing, which could hamper our control over liquidity.\nOur Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2020 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), imposes certain requirements in order for us to make dividend payments to our shareholders. Please see the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of the \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section of this Report for additional information. Adverse changes in our financial condition and results of operations could result in the Credit Agreement prohibiting us from paying any dividends or incurring additional debt in the future.\nWe are exposed to various risks associated with the credit and capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow, and reported earnings.\nOur cash equivalents and investments may be comprised of money market, asset-backed securities and public corporate debt securities. Global credit and capital markets can be suddenly and unexpectedly impaired, such as during the 2008 global financial crisis, and there can be no assurance that such markets will recover quickly or at all. Declines in the fair value of securities in our investment portfolio could lead to an increased risk that an other-than-temporary impairment exists. Uncertainties in the credit and capital markets or credit rating downgrades on any investments in our portfolio could cause impairment to our investment portfolio, which could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow, and reported earnings.\nWe do not collect sales or consumption taxes in some jurisdictions, and if such jurisdictions successfully challenged this practice, we could be subject to liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not collect sales or consumption taxes in certain jurisdictions. An increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices that attempt to impose obligations on out-of-state or out of jurisdiction retailers to collect taxes on their behalf. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to remit taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\nCertain states have been aggressively seeking to require even those businesses that do not maintain a physical presence in such states to collect sales and use taxes, rather than relying on the consumers to pay such taxes themselves. In June 2018, the United States Supreme Court issued a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, et al. that upheld a South Dakota statute that imposes sales tax collection on an out of state seller under certain conditions that do not include physical presence in South Dakota. This, and any similar laws in other states, could result in us being required to collect state sales and use taxes in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so. This could reduce demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure to additional state or international tax liabilities which may adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the US Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. In addition, the application of other indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax) to a business such as Stamps.com is a complex and evolving issue, and states are increasingly seeking to assess sales tax on subscription fees. State or local authorities may attempt to collect taxes on our income based on this evolving area. The application of existing, new or future laws could have adverse effects on our business, prospects and operating results. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business.\nAmong other factors, our effective tax rate is affected by the actions of third parties that we can neither control nor accurately predict, including the market for our common stock and the occurrence and timing of exercise of options awarded under our equity incentive plans. Actions that have generated material tax deductions for us in prior periods, such as the exercise of employee stock options, may not be repeated at the same levels in future periods, and our effective tax rate may increase as a result.\nThe potential of increased deficits that may result from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and/or other economic, political or other factors that we are not able to predict, could prompt future legislative action that may increase our tax rates, modify or eliminate deductions, credits or other tax features from which we currently benefit, or otherwise cause our effective tax rate to increase. Any increase in our effective tax rate would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.\nA number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:\n\u2022changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;\n\u2022a lack of, or decrease in, exercises of employee stock options;\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n\u2022increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n\u2022changes in available tax credits;\n\u2022changes in our ability to secure new or renew existing tax holidays and incentives;\n\u2022changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation; and\n\u2022changes in accounting standards.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nSeveral provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition, which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSeveral provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation, and our bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, and the market price of our common stock could be reduced as a result. These provisions include:\n\u2022authorizing our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022prohibiting us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless certain provisions are met;\n\u2022prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022requiring a two-thirds vote of our outstanding shares to amend our bylaws;\n\u2022affording the ability to call special meetings of stockholders exclusively to our board of directors; and\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation contains certain net operating loss protective provisions (the \u201cNOL Protective Measures\u201d), which are more specifically described in our Definitive Proxy filed with the SEC on April 2, 2008. Generally, the NOL Protective Measures provide that any person, company or investment firm that wishes to become a \u201c5% shareholder\u201d (as defined in our certificate of incorporation) must first obtain a waiver from our board of directors. In addition, any person, company or investment firm that is already a \u201c5% shareholder\u201d of ours cannot make any additional purchases of our stock without a waiver from our board of directors.\nOn July 22, 2010, our board of directors suspended the NOL Protective Measures by approving a waiver from the NOL Protective Measures to all persons and entities, including companies and investment firms. As a result, our stockholders are now allowed to become \u201c5% shareholders\u201d and existing \u201c5% shareholders\u201d are allowed to make additional purchases of our stock each without having to comply with the restrictions contained in the NOL Protective Measures. Our board of directors may revoke this waiver at any time if the board deems the revocation\nnecessary to protect against a Section 382 \u201cchange of ownership\u201d that would limit our ability to utilize future NOLs. For complete details about this waiver from the NOL Protective Measures, please see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 28, 2010.\nIf our board of directors were to revoke the existing waiver of our NOL Protective Measures so that the measures operated again to prevent new \"5% shareholders,\" then the NOL Protective Measures could be deemed to have an \u201canti-takeover\u201d effect because, among other things, they would restrict the ability of a person, entity or group to accumulate more than 5% of our common stock and the ability of persons, entities or groups now owning more than 5% of our common stock to acquire additional shares of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors. As a result, our board of directors might be able to prevent any future takeover attempt. Therefore, the NOL Protective Measures could discourage or prevent accumulations of substantial blocks of shares in which our stockholders might receive a substantial premium above market value and might tend to insulate management against the possibility of removal.\nOur stock price has been volatile, which makes it more difficult for investors to predict at what price they may be able to sell their shares, and may make us a target for securities class action litigation.\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022variations in our operating results;\n\u2022variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u2022sales by stockholders holding larger blocks of our stock;\n\u2022announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others; and\n\u2022market volatility in general.\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\nWe have been, and in the future could be, subject to securities class action litigation following periods of volatility in our stock price. For example, on February 28, 2019 and March 13, 2019, we and certain of our officers were sued in putative class action lawsuits alleging violations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements, and from May 2019 through October 2019 several purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed alleging breaches of fiduciary duties by our officers and/or directors and violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, among other things. See Item 3 \"Legal Proceedings,\" below. We may be the target of additional litigation of these types in the future as well. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nThe USPS may object to a change of control of our common stock, which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe USPS may raise national security or similar concerns to prevent foreign persons from acquiring (or require foreign persons to divest) significant ownership of our common stock or of our Company. The USPS also has regulations regarding the change of control of approved PC Postage providers. These concerns may prohibit or delay a merger or other takeover of our Company that stockholders may consider favorable, and the market price of our common stock could be reduced as a result. Our competitors may also seek to have the USPS block the acquisition by a foreign person of our common stock or our Company in order to prevent the combined company from becoming a more effective competitor in the market for postage solutions.\nWe may expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies or technologies, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and consume resources that may be necessary to sustain our business.\nAs part of our business efforts to acquire complementary services, technologies or businesses, we may:\n\u2022issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n\u2022use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business; and\n\u2022incur additional debt or refinance existing debt that could have terms unfavorable to us or that we might be unable to repay.\nBusiness acquisitions, such as the acquisitions of PSI Systems, Inc. (Endicia), Metapack Limited (Metapack), ShippingEasy Group, Inc. (ShippingEasy), Auctane LLC (ShipStation) and Interapptive, Inc. (ShipWorks), also involve risks of unknown liabilities and potential litigation associated with the acquired business. In addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, including securing the services of key employees. Incurring unknown liabilities or the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could seriously harm our business. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business - Our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining acquisitions and investments,\u201d above.\nRisks Related to General Economic and Market Conditions\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and may subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the US To the extent of our international operations, additional risks that could adversely affect our business, include:\n\u2022difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022management distraction;\n\u2022political or social unrest and economic instability;\n\u2022compliance with US laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n\u2022difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022regulatory requirements or government action against our services, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our services in the applicable jurisdiction;\n\u2022less favorable foreign intellectual property laws;\n\u2022adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates, against which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge, and which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u2022profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition;\n\u2022low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;\n\u2022different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization requirements;\n\u2022availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion; and\n\u2022integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities in connection with companies we may acquire or control.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could sour rapidly and unexpectedly, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions and events have negatively impacted global and regional financial markets in the past, and uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values, and other factors many of which are beyond our ability to anticipate. These and other global and regional economic events and conditions could have a material adverse impact on demand for our products and services, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our customers, and integration partners and other companies with which we do business. Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us or our integration partners to deliver products and services to our customers. In the event of a natural disaster, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.", "PERMNO": 87000, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "STMP"}
