Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, capital levels, cash flows, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. The market price of our common stock could decline significantly due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose some or all of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur financial condition and results of operations are dependent on the economy, particularly in 1st Security Bank of Washington\u2019s market area. The current economic conditions in the market area served may continue to impact our earnings adversely and could increase the credit risk of our loan portfolio.\nOur primary market area is concentrated in the Puget Sound region of Washington. Our business is directly affected by market conditions, trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, and changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. General economic conditions, including inflation, unemployment and money supply fluctuations, also may affect our profitability adversely. Weak economic conditions and ongoing strains in the financial and housing markets could result in higher levels of loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and a decline in the values of the collateral securing our loans.\nA deterioration in economic conditions in the market area we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ncollateral for our loans may further decline in value, in turn reducing customer's borrowing power, reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of our low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits may decrease.\nA decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are geographically diverse. If we are required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values, our financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected.\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEconomic conditions have improved since the end of the economic recession that officially ended in June, 2009; however, economic growth has been slow and uneven, unemployment remains relatively high and concerns still exist over the federal deficit, government spending, global geopolitical risks which have all contributed to diminished expectations for the economy.\nA return of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our\nongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and high unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in an attempt to help the economy, has, among other things, kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. If the Federal Reserve Board increases the federal funds rate, market interest rates would likely rise, which may negatively affect the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to a large percentage of consumer loans.\nOur consumer loans accounted for $136.8 million, or 34.7% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014, of which $99.3 million (72.6% of total consumer loans) consisted of indirect home improvement loans (some of which were not secured by a lien on the real property), $18.2 million (13.3% of total consumer loans) consisted of solar loans, $16.7 million (12.2% of total consumer loans) consisted of marine loans secured by boats, $674,000 (.5% of total consumer loans) consisted of automobile loans, $441,000 (.3% of total consumer loans) consisted of recreational loans, mainly secured by recreational vehicles and motorcycles, $329,000 (.2% of total consumer loans) consisted of home improvement consumer loans and $1.2 million (.9% of total consumer loans) consisted of other consumer loans. Generally, we consider these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to first mortgage loans on owner-occupied, one-to-four-family residential properties. As a result of our large portfolio of consumer loans, it may become necessary to increase the level of provision for our loan losses, which would reduce profits. Consumer loans generally entail greater risk than do one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles and boats. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance.\nMost of our consumer loans are originated indirectly by or through third parties, which presents greater risk than our direct lending products which involves direct contact between us and the borrower. Unlike a direct loan where the borrower makes an application directly to us, in these loans the dealer, who has a direct financial interest in the loan transaction, assists the borrower in preparing the loan application. Although we disburse the loan proceeds directly to the borrower upon receipt of a \u201ccompletion certificate\u201d signed by the borrower, because we do not have direct contact with the borrower, these loans may be more susceptible to a material misstatement on the loan application or having the loan proceeds being misused by the borrower or the dealer. In addition, if the work is not properly performed, the borrower may cease payment on the loan until the problem is rectified.\nIndirect home improvement and solar loans totaled $117.5 million, or 29.8% of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2014, and are originated through a network of approximately 132 home improvement contractors and dealers located in Washington, Oregon and California. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $17.7 million in loans to borrowers that reside in California. Adverse economic conditions in California, including an increase in the level of unemployment, or a decline in real estate values could adversely affect the ability of these borrowers to make loan payments to us.\nIn addition, we rely on three dealers for a majority or 56.1% of our loan volume so the loss of one of these dealers can have a significant effect on our loan origination volume. See Item 1., \u201cBusiness of 1st Security Bank of Washington - Lending Activities - Consumer Lending\u201d and \u201c- Asset Quality.\u201d\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, continuing and growing relationships with home improvement contractors and dealers.\nOur indirect home improvement lending, which is the largest component of our loan portfolio, is reliant on our relationships with home improvement contractors and dealers. In particular, our indirect home improvement loan operations depend in large part upon our ability to establish and maintain relationships with reputable contractors and dealers who originate loans at the point of sale. Our indirect home improvement contractor/dealer network is currently comprised of approximately 132 active contractors and dealers with businesses located throughout Washington, Oregon\nand California with approximately three contractors/dealers responsible for more than half of this loan volume. Indirect home improvement and solar loans totaled $117.5 million, or 29.8% of our total gross loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2014, reflecting approximately 13,000 loans with an average balance of approximately $9,000.\nWe have relationships with home improvement contractors/dealers, however, the relationships generally are not exclusive, some of them are newly established and they may be terminated at any time. If there is another economic downturn and contraction of credit to both contractors/dealers and their customers, there could be an increase in business closures and our existing contractor/dealer base could experience decreased sales and loan volume, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if a competitor were to offer better service or more attractive loan products to our contractor/dealer partners, it is possible that our partners would terminate their relationships with us or recommend customers to our competitors. If we are unable to continue to grow our existing relationships and develop new relationships, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2012, we expanded consumer solar loan originations in California which enabled us to increase sales of consumer solar loans from $2.5 million at the beginning of 2013 to $16.8 million at the end of 2013. This growth continued in 2014 and resulted in $27.2 million in consumer solar loan sales during the year ended December 31, 2014. We have adopted limits on California lending to be no more than 20% of the total consumer portfolio. As of December 31, 2014, the maximum level of California originated consumer solar loans would be $27.4 million. As of December 31, 2014, we held $17.7 million of these consumer solar loans to borrowers located in California.\nA significant portion of our business involves commercial business, commercial construction and commercial real estate lending which is subject to various risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2014, our loan portfolio included $194.9 million of commercial real estate, commercial construction, multi-family real estate loans, and commercial business loans, or 49.4% of our total gross loan portfolio, compared to $128.5 million, or 44.7%, at December 31, 2013. We have been increasing and intend to continue to increase, subject to market demand, the origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans. The credit risk related to these types of loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to one-to-four-family residential loans because the repayment of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans typically is dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the property securing the loan and/or the borrowers\u2019 business and the value of the real estate securing the loan as collateral, which can be significantly affected by economic conditions.\nOur renewed focus on these types of lending will increase the risk profile relative to traditional one-to-four-family lenders as we continue to implement our business strategy. Although commercial business and commercial real estate loans are intended to enhance the average yield of the earning assets, they do involve a different, and possibly higher, level of risk of delinquency or collection than generally associated with one-to-four-family loans for a number of reasons. Among other factors, these loans involve larger balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. Since commercial business, commercial construction and commercial real estate loans generally have large balances, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of these loans, we may need to significantly increase the provision for loan losses since any resulting charge-offs will be larger on a per loan basis. Consequently, this could materially adversely affect our future earnings. Collateral evaluation and financial statement analysis in these types of loans also requires a more detailed analysis at the time of loan underwriting and on an ongoing basis. Finally, if foreclosure occurs on a commercial real estate loan, the holding period for the collateral, if any, typically is longer than for a one-to-four-family residence because the secondary market for most types of commercial real estate is not readily liquid, so we have less opportunity to mitigate credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these assets. See Item 1., \u201cBusiness of 1st Security Bank of Washington - Lending Activities - Commercial Real Estate Lending\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nOur mortgage warehouse lending program is subject to various risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn October 2009, we commenced a mortgage warehouse lending program. Our mortgage warehouse lending program focuses on six Pacific Northwest mortgage banking companies. Short term funding is provided to the mortgage banking companies for the purpose of originating residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. Our warehouse lending lines are secured by the underlying notes associated with mortgage loans made to borrowers by the\nmortgage banking company and we generally require guarantees from the principle shareholder(s) of the mortgage banking company. These loans are repaid when the note is sold by the mortgage bank into the secondary market, with the proceeds from the sale used to pay down the outstanding loan before being dispersed to the mortgage bank. As of December 31, 2014, we had approved warehouse lending lines in varying amounts from $3.0 million to $9.0 million with each of the six companies, for an aggregate amount of $34.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we processed approximately 1,000 loans and funded approximately $272.1 million under this program. Our mortgage warehouse related gross revenues totaled $573,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, there was $10.1 million in warehouse lines outstanding, compared to $4.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2013.\nThere are numerous risks associated with this type of lending, which include, without limitation, (i) credit risks relating to the mortgage bankers that borrow from us, (ii) the risk of intentional misrepresentation or fraud by any of these mortgage bankers, (iii) changes in the market value of mortgage loans originated by the mortgage banker, the sale of which is the expected source of repayment of the borrowings under the warehouse line of credit, due to changes in interest rates during the time in warehouse, (iv) unsalable or impaired mortgage loans so originated, which could lead to decreased collateral value and the failure of a purchaser of the mortgage loan to purchase the loan from the mortgage banker, and (v) the volatility of mortgage loan originations.\nAdditionally, the impact of interest rates on our mortgage warehouse lending business can be significant. Changes in interest rates can impact the number of residential mortgages originated and initially funded under mortgage warehouse lines of credit and thus our mortgage warehouse related revenues. A decline in mortgage rates generally increases the demand for mortgage loans. Conversely, in a constant or increasing rate environment, we would expect fewer loans to be originated.\nOur lending limit may limit growth.\nThe Board of Directors have implemented a policy lending limit that it believes matches the Washington State legal lending limit. Our policy limits loans to one borrower and the borrower\u2019s related entities to 20% of our unimpaired capital and surplus, or $12.4 million at December 31, 2014. Management has adopted a limit of $9.5 million for risk mitigation purposes and all relationships above this level require full Board approval. These amounts are significantly less than that of many of our competitors and may discourage potential commercial borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our lending limit from doing business with us. The lending limit also impacts the efficiency of our commercial lending operation because it tends to lower the average loan size, which means a higher number of transactions have to be generated to achieve the same portfolio volume. We can accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy is not efficient or always available. We may not be able to attract or maintain clients seeking larger loans or may not be able to sell participations in these loans on terms that are considered favorable.\nWe continue to expand residential construction lending which is subject to various risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nTo assist in expanding our residential construction lending program, we hired several new experienced construction lenders in the third quarter of 2011 with the focus of lending up to 100% of total risk-based capital in construction and development lending. Our residential construction lending program focuses on the origination of loans to builders, both pre-sold and speculative, for the purpose of constructing and selling primarily one-to-four-family residences within the market area. Our construction and development loans totaled $57.8 million, or 14.7%, of total gross loans at December 31, 2014. The Company's total risk-based capital was $70.9 million as of December 31, 2014.\nConstruction and development lending contains the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property\u2019s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost (including interest) of the project. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. In addition, during the term of most of our construction loans, an interest reserve is created at origination and is added to the principal of the loan through the construction phase. If the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted at, or prior to, the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment. Speculative construction loans to a builder are often associated with homes that are not pre-sold, and thus pose a greater potential risk than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences. Loans on land under development or held for future construction pose additional risk because of\nthe lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. These risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand. As a result, this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor themselves to repay principal and interest.\nRevenue from mortgage banking operations are sensitive to changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market, higher interest rates or new legislation and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn an effort to diversify our revenue streams and to generate additional income, we hired several experienced bankers to reintroduce in-house originations of residential mortgage loans through a mortgage banking program in 2012. We expect to hire additional staff throughout 2015 to support our originations. Our mortgage banking program, which started in the fourth quarter of 2011, is dependent upon our ability to originate and sell loans to investors. Mortgage revenues are primarily generated from gains on the sale of one-to-four-family residential loans underwritten to programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, VA, USDA Rural Housing and other non-GSE investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. We sell loans on both a servicing retained and servicing released basis utilizing market execution analysis and customer relationships as the criteria. Any future changes in these programs, our eligibility to participate in these programs, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of these entities could, in turn, materially adversely affect the success of our mortgage banking program and, consequently, our results of operations.\nMortgage loan production levels are sensitive to changes in economic conditions and can suffer from decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market or higher interest rates. Generally, any sustained period of decreased economic activity or higher interest rates could adversely affect mortgage originations and, consequently, adversely affect income from mortgage lending activities.\nCurrently, as a result of government actions and other economic factors related to the economic downturn, interest rates are at historically low levels. It is unknown how long interest rates will remain at these historically low levels. To the extent that market interest rates increase in the future, our ability to originate mortgage loans held for sale may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors. This would adversely affect our ability to generate mortgage revenues, and consequently noninterest income. Because interest rates depend on factors outside of our control, we cannot eliminate the interest rate risk associated with our mortgage operations.\nOur results of operations will also be affected by the amount of noninterest expense associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs. If we cannot generate a sufficient volume of loans for sale, our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, during periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations.\nFinally, deteriorating economic conditions may also increase the potential for home buyers to default on their mortgages. In certain of these cases where we have originated loans and sold them to investors, we may be required to repurchase loans or provide a financial settlement to investors if it is proven that the borrower failed to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor. Such repurchases or settlements would also adversely affect our net income.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could be reduced.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review loans and our historical loss and delinquency experience, and evaluate economic conditions. Management recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios, new loan products and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses, resulting in additional provisions for loan losses to replenish the allowance for loan losses. Deterioration in economic conditions, new information regarding existing\nloans, identification of additional problem loans or relationships, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may increase our loan charge-offs and/or may also otherwise also require an increase in our provision for loan losses.\nOur allowance for loan losses was 1.5% of total gross loans, and 1,406.5% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2014, compared to 1.8% of total gross loans, and 462.5% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2013. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize additional loan charge-offs. Any increases in the provision for loan losses may result in a decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and capital.\nThe unseasoned nature of our commercial business, commercial construction and commercial real estate portfolios may result in difficulties in judging collectability, which may lead to additional provisions or charge-offs, which would reduce our profits.\nDuring the periods from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014, we originated $230.4 million of loans, including loans in process, with an outstanding balance of $164.4 million, as of December 31, 2014. As a result, a significant portion of the portfolio is relatively unseasoned and some borrowers may not have had sufficient time to perform to properly indicate the magnitude of potential losses. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAt December 31, 2014, $46.8 million, or 11.9% of our total loan portfolio, was secured by first liens on one-to-four-family residential loans and our home equity lines of credit totaled $15.7 million, or 4.0% of our total loan portfolio. These types of loans are generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. A decline in residential real estate values resulting from a downturn in the Washington housing markets in which our loans are concentrated may reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans and increase our risk of loss if borrowers default on their loans. A decline in economic conditions or in the volume of real estate sales and/or the sales prices coupled with elevated unemployment rates may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets, and a decline in demand for our products and services. In addition, residential loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios will be more sensitive to the fluctuation of property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. Further, the majority of our home equity lines of credit consist of second mortgage loans. For those home equity lines secured by a second mortgage, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan proceeds in the event of default unless we are prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property. For these reasons, we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses which would adversely affect our net income.\nOur non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans may expose us to increased credit risk.\nAt December 31, 2014, $20.3 million, or 5.1% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of loans secured by non-owner occupied commercial real estate properties. Loans secured by non-owner occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured by owner occupied properties because repayment of such loans depend primarily on the tenant\u2019s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner\u2019s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. Furthermore, some of our non-owner occupied commercial loan borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. At December 31, 2014, we had three non-owner occupied commercial loan relationships, each having an outstanding balance over $500,000, with aggregate outstanding balances of $5.1 million. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one credit relationship may expose us to a greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to an owner occupied commercial real estate loan.\nOur securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Our securities portfolio is evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our shareholders' equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. There can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. Currently, we are expanding existing commercial real estate, commercial business and residential lending programs such as home improvement loans for consumer solar projects. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate new personnel hired to grow our mortgage banking operations, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have recently hired a number of experienced bankers in the area of residential mortgage banking. We expect to hire additional personnel in this area in order to successfully carryout our business plan. The difficulties in hiring and training new personnel include integrating personnel with different business backgrounds, and combining different corporate cultures, while retaining other key employees. The process of integrating personnel could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in our operations and the loss of customers and key personnel. In addition, we may not realize expected revenue increases and other projected benefits from the increased emphasis in this lending area. Any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with integrating and growing of this portion of our operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated results.\nChanges in interest rates may reduce our net interest income, and may result in higher defaults in a rising rate environment.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but these changes could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and (iii) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio and other interest-earning assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Further, a prolonged period of exceptionally low market interest rates, such as we are currently experiencing and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has indicated it intends to maintain, limits our ability to lower our interest expense, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may decrease as our loans reprice or are originated at these low market rates. Accordingly, our net interest income may decrease, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet or projected operating results. See Item 7., \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans or other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the Washington markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets. See Item 7., \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity\u201d included herein.\nLoss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers.\nOur business is primarily relationship-driven in that some of our business development and relationship managers have extensive customer relationships. Loss of such key personnel could result in the loss of some of our customers. While we believe the relationship with key producers is good, we cannot guarantee that all of the key personnel will remain with our organization. The loss of these key persons could negatively impact the affected banking operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. These competitors primarily include national, regional and internet banks within the various markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, mortgage banking finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top-quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022\nthe ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1., \u201cBusiness - Competition\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.\nWe are currently subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the FDIC and the DFI. The FDIC and the DFI govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors and the DFI. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on an institution\u2019s operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, restrict mergers and acquisitions, investments, access to capital, the location of banking offices, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firms. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of our operations as could our interpretation of those changes.\nAdditionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and will affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.\nCertain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to have a near term impact on us. For example, a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Financial institutions such as 1st Security Bank of Washington with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators.\nIn January of 2013, the CFPB issued several final regulations and changes to certain consumer protections under existing laws. These final rules, most of the provisions of which (including the qualified mortgage rule) became effective January 10, 2014, generally prohibit creditors from extending mortgage loans without regard for the consumer\u2019s ability-to-repay and add restrictions and requirements to mortgage origination and servicing practices. In addition, these rules limit prepayment penalties and require the creditor to retain evidence of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirement for three years. Compliance with these rules will likely increase our overall regulatory compliance costs and may require changes to our underwriting practices with respect to mortgage loans. Moreover, these rules\nmay adversely affect the volume of mortgage loans that we underwrite and may subject us to increased potential liabilities related to such residential loan origination activities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk-based capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies and bank holding companies that are no less stringent than those applicable to banks, which will limit our ability to borrow at the holding company level and invest the proceeds from such borrowings as capital in the Bank, and will exclude certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as Tier 1 capital.\nIt is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. However, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs, which could adversely affect key operating efficiency ratios, and could increase our interest expense. See Item 1., \u201cBusiness - How We are Regulated\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nAny other additional changes in our regulation and oversight, whether in the form of new laws, rules or regulations, could likewise make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.\nOur security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our or our customers' confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant reputational damage.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our Internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard Internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to our reputation and our business.\nOur security measures may not protect us from systems failures or interruptions. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any failures or interruptions may require us to identify alternative sources of such services and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Further, the occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nOur loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We have also experienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur.\nIf our investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle becomes impaired, our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity could decrease.\nAt December 31, 2014, we owned $1.7 million in FHLB of Seattle stock. We are required to own this stock to be a member of and to obtain advances from the FHLB. This stock is not marketable and can only be redeemed by our FHLB, with the permission of its regulators as the FHLB of Seattle is currently operating under a consent order entered into with its primary federal regulator. Our FHLB's financial condition is linked, in part, to the eleven other members of the FHLB System and to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could materially lower their capital, which would cause our FHLB stock to be deemed impaired, resulting in a decrease in our earnings and assets.\nOn September 25, 2014, the FHLB Seattle and FHLB Des Moines announced a proposed merger. Under this proposal, the Bank would become a member of FHLB Des Moines and all shares of our FHLB Seattle stock would convert to equal shares of FHLB Des Moines stock. If the merger is terminated by either the FHLB Des Moines or the FHLB Seattle , the terminating FHLB must pay $57 million in termination fees. If the FHLB Seattle were to terminate the agreement, this could result in significant impairment to our investment in the FHLB Seattle, potentially decreasing our earnings and shareholders' equity.", "PERMNO": 13528, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "FSBW"}
