{"cik": "1619954", "company": "Inovalon Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSet forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our stockholders. You should carefully consider the following risks in evaluating our Company and our business. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the market price of shares of our common stock and our ability to, among other things, satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders, which in turn could cause our stockholders to lose all or a part of their investment. Some statements in this report including statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not grow at the rates we historically have achieved or at all, even if our key metrics may indicate growth, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have experienced significant growth since 2014, with total revenues growing from approximately $361.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to approximately $527.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Future revenues may not grow at these same rates or may decline, such as the approximate 2% revenue decline from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016. Our future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our revenue from existing clients, to complete sales to potential new clients, to expand our client base in adjacent industry segments such as the life sciences industry and with provider organizations, to develop new services and capabilities including direct-to-consumer services, and to expand internationally. We can provide no assurances that we will be successful in executing on these growth strategies or that, even if our key metrics, such as trailing 12 month Patient Analytics Months (\u201cPAM\u201d), would indicate future growth, we will continue to grow our revenue, margins or net income. Our ability to execute on our existing sales pipeline, create additional sales opportunities, and expand our client base depends on, among other things, the attractiveness of our services relative to those offered by our competitors, our ability to demonstrate the value of our existing and future services, and our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing leadership and support personnel. In addition, clients in certain industries in which we have a more limited presence, such as the life sciences industry, may be slower to adopt our services than we currently anticipate, which could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf our existing clients do not renew their agreements with us, renew at lower fee levels, decline to purchase additional services from us, choose to purchase fewer services from us, or terminate their agreements with us, and we are unable to replace any lost revenue, our business and operating results could suffer.\nWe historically have derived, and expect in the future to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from renewals of existing client agreements and sales of additional services to existing clients. As a result, achieving a high renewal rate of our client agreements and selling additional services to existing clients is critical to our future operating results. It is difficult to predict our client renewal rate, and we may experience significantly more difficulty than we anticipate in renewing existing client agreements. Factors that may affect the renewal rate for our services and our ability to sell additional services include:\n\u2022\nthe price, performance and functionality of our services;\n\u2022\nthe availability, price, performance and functionality of competing services;\n\u2022\nour clients\u2019 perceived ability to develop and perform the services that we offer using their internal resources;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop complementary services;\n\u2022\nour continued ability to access the data necessary to enable us to effectively develop and deliver new services to clients;\n\u2022\nthe stability and security of our platform;\n\u2022\nchanges in healthcare laws, regulations or trends; and\n\u2022\nthe business environment of our clients, in particular, reductions in our clients\u2019 membership populations and budgetary constraints affecting our clients.\nContracts with our clients generally have stated terms of two to five years. However, our clients have no obligation to renew their contracts for our services after the term expires. In addition, a high renewal rate in any particular year does not necessarily correlate to recurring or increasing revenue from our existing clients, as our clients may negotiate terms less advantageous to us upon renewal, may renew for fewer services, may choose to discontinue one or more services under an existing contract, may exercise flexibilities within their contracts to adjust service volumes, or which could reduce our revenue from these clients. Accordingly, annual renewal rate metrics have inherent limitations and renewal rates should not be used as a key metric to evaluate the Company\u2019s results of operations. Our future operating results also depend, in part, on our ability to sell new services to our existing clients. If our clients fail to renew their agreements, renew their agreements upon less favorable terms, at lower fee levels or for fewer services, fail to purchase new services from us, or terminate their agreements with us, and we are unsuccessful in generating significant revenue from new clients to replace any lost revenue, our revenues may decline and our future revenue growth may be constrained.\nIf a client fails to fulfill its obligations under its agreements with us, or permanently terminates certain services or its agreement in its entirety prior to its expected completion date, whether or not in our view permitted by the terms of the agreement, and revenue and cash flows expected from a client are not realized in the time period expected or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur top clients account for a significant portion of our revenues and, as a result, the loss of one or more of these clients could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur top ten clients accounted for approximately 42% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. The engagement between these clients and us generally is covered through multiple separate statements of work (\u201cSOWs\u201d), each often with different and/or staggered terms which are all multi-year in their duration, ranging typically from two to five years. We can provide no assurance that these clients will renew their existing contracts or all SOWs with us upon expiration or that any such failure to renew will not have a material adverse effect on our revenue. If we lose one or more of our top clients, or if one or more of these clients significantly decreases its use of our services, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we do not develop new services that are adopted by clients, or fail to provide high quality support services to our clients, our growth prospects, revenues and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur longer-term operating results and revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to successfully develop and sell new services that existing and potential clients want and are willing to purchase. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new high-quality services that clients and prospective clients will want. If we are unable to predict or adapt to changes in user preferences or industry or regulatory changes, or if we are unable to modify our services on a timely basis in response to those changes, clients may not renew their agreements with us, and our services may become less attractive than services offered by our competitors. Our operating results could also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market. Our success also depends on successfully providing high-quality support services to resolve any issues related to our services. High-quality education and client support is important for the successful marketing and sale of our services and for the renewal of existing clients. If we do not help our clients quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional services to existing clients would suffer and our reputation with existing or potential clients would be harmed.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our growth effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we are successful in expanding our client base and growing our business, our existing services may not be as scalable as we anticipate, and we may need to expend significant resources to enhance our IT infrastructure, financial and accounting systems, and controls, and also hire a significant number of qualified client support personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, and management personnel in order to provide services to those new clients. As a result, our expenses may increase more than expected, which could adversely affect our results of operations and net income. In addition, identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our services requires significant time, expense, and\nattention, and our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to expand and train qualified personnel do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues. If our existing services are not as scalable as we anticipate or if we are unable to manage our growth and the cost thereof effectively, the quality of our services and our reputation may suffer, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf our security measures fail or are breached and unauthorized access to a client\u2019s data is obtained, our services may be perceived as insecure, we may incur significant liabilities, our reputation may be harmed, and we could lose sales and clients.\nOur services involve the storage and transmission of clients\u2019 proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, including valuable intellectual property and personal information of employees, clients and others, as well as protected health information, or PHI, of our clients\u2019 patients. Because of the extreme sensitivity of the information we store and transmit, the security features of our computer, network, and communications systems infrastructure are critical to the success of our business. A breach or failure of our security measures could result from a variety of circumstances and events, including third-party action, employee negligence or error, malfeasance, computer viruses, cyber-attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software and databases, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, or catastrophic events. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks, including, for example, the Spectre and Meltdown threats which, rather than acting as viruses, were design flaws in many CPUs that allowed programs to steal data stored in the memory of other running programs and required patch software to correct. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to further enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. If our security measures fail or are breached, it could result in unauthorized persons accessing sensitive client or patient data (including PHI), a loss of or damage to our data, an inability to access data sources, or process data or provide our services to our clients. Such failures or breaches of our security measures, or our inability to effectively resolve such failures or breaches in a timely manner, could severely damage our reputation, adversely affect client or investor confidence in us, and reduce the demand for our services from existing and potential clients. In addition, we could face litigation, damages for contract breach, monetary penalties, or regulatory actions for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and incur significant costs for remedial measures to prevent future occurrences and mitigate past violations. Although we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident.\nWe may experience cyber-security and other breach incidents that remain undetected for an extended period. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, in the event that our clients authorize or enable third parties to access their information and data that are stored on our systems, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such data in our systems as we would not control access. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, or if we are unable to effectively resolve such breaches in a timely manner, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results.\nData protection, privacy and similar laws restrict access, use, and disclosure of information, and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially and adversely harm our business.\nWe are subject to federal and state data privacy and security regulations. HIPAA established uniform federal standards for certain \u201ccovered entities,\u201d which include healthcare providers and health plans, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of PHI. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates, and other persons for HIPAA violations. Under HITECH, state attorneys general were granted new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA\u2019s requirements, and to seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.\nA portion of the data that we obtain and handle for or on behalf of our clients is considered PHI and subject to HIPAA because our clients are covered entities under HIPAA and we act as their business associate. Under HIPAA and our contractual agreements with our covered entity health plan clients, we are considered a \u201cbusiness associate.\u201d Therefore, we are required to maintain the privacy and security of PHI in accordance with HIPAA and the terms of our agreements with clients which includes implementing HIPAA-required administrative, technical, and physical safeguards.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs to establish and maintain these safeguards and, if additional safeguards are required to comply with HIPAA or our clients\u2019 requirements, our costs could increase further, which would negatively affect our operating results. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain adequate safeguards, or if we use or disclose PHI in a manner not permitted by HIPAA or our agreements with our clients, or if the privacy or security of PHI that we obtain and handle is otherwise compromised, we could be subject to significant liabilities and consequences, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nbreach of our contractual obligations to clients, which may result in contract terminations and potentially significant financial obligations to our clients;\n\u2022\ninvestigation by the federal regulatory authorities empowered to enforce HIPAA - the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within HHS, and the possible imposition of civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ninvestigation by the state attorneys general empowered under HITECH to enforce comparable state laws, and the possible imposition of civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nprivate litigation by individuals adversely affected by any violation of HIPAA, HITECH, or comparable state laws to which we are subject; and\n\u2022\nnegative publicity, which may decrease the willingness of current and potential future clients to work with us and negatively affect our sales and operating results.\nLaws and expectations relating to privacy continue to evolve, and we continue to adapt to changing needs. Nevertheless, changes in these laws may limit our data access, use, and disclosure, and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services. In addition, data protection, privacy and similar laws protect more than patient information and, although they vary by jurisdiction, these laws can extend to employee information, business contact information, provider information, and other information relating to identifiable individuals. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide services to our clients and, in turn, our results of operations.\nData protection, privacy and similar laws protect more than patient information and, although they vary by jurisdiction, these laws can extend to employee information, business contact information, provider information, and other information relating to identifiable individuals. Failure to comply with these laws may result in, among other things, civil and criminal liability, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, and liability under contractual provisions. In addition, compliance with such laws may require increased costs to us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services in the future.\nThe information that we provide to our clients could be inaccurate or incomplete, which could harm our business reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe aggregate, process, and analyze healthcare-related data and information for use by our clients. Because data in the healthcare industry is fragmented in origin, inconsistent in format, and often incomplete, the overall quality of data received or accessed in the healthcare industry is often poor, the degree or amount of data which is knowingly or unknowingly absent or omitted can be material, and we frequently discover data issues and errors during our data integrity checks. If the analytical data that we provide to our clients are based on incorrect or incomplete data or if we make mistakes in the capture, input, or analysis of these data, our reputation may suffer and our ability to attract and retain clients may be materially harmed.\nIn addition, we assist our clients with the management and submission of data to governmental entities, including CMS. These processes and submissions are governed by complex data processing and validation policies and regulations. If we fail to abide by such policies or submit incorrect or incomplete data, we may be exposed to liability to a client, court, or government agency that concludes that our storage, handling, submission, delivery, or display of health information or other data was wrongful or erroneous. Further, although we maintain insurance coverage, this coverage may prove to be inadequate or could cease to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time, attention, and resources. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGeneral economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business.\nThe demand for our platform capabilities, toolsets and services may be impacted by factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, and the level of interest rates. We believe that the state of economic and political conditions in the U.S. is particularly uncertain due to ongoing political discord between and among the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government, potential shifts in legislative and regulatory conditions concerning, among other matters, international trade and taxation, as well as healthcare, and that an uneven recovery or a renewed global downturn may contribute to reduced demand for our platforms, toolsets and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is principally focused on the healthcare industry, and factors that adversely affect the financial condition of the healthcare industry could consequently affect our business.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from clients within the healthcare industry. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by conditions affecting the healthcare industry generally and health systems and payers in particular. For example, in 2016 and 2017, consumer operated and oriented plans, or health insurance Co-Ops, experienced financial distress, including insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidation, and many were forced to exit the exchange marketplace. Our\nability to grow will depend upon the economic environment of the healthcare industry, as well as our ability to increase the number of services that we sell to our clients. Furthermore, we may not become aware in a timely manner of changes in regulatory requirements affecting our business, which could result in us taking, or failing to take, actions, resulting in noncompliance with state or federal regulations.\nThere are many factors that could affect the purchasing practices, operations and, ultimately, the operating funds of healthcare organizations, such as reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses, consolidation in the healthcare industry, and regulation, litigation, and general economic conditions. In particular, we could be required to make unplanned modifications to our services or could suffer delays or cancellations of orders or reductions in demand for our services as a result of changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry, such as any increased regulation by governmental agencies, changes to HIPAA and other federal or state privacy laws, laws relating to the tax-exempt status of many of our clients or restrictions on permissible discounts, and other financial arrangements. We cannot predict with certainty what additional healthcare regulations, if any, will be implemented at the federal and state level, or what the ultimate effect of federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation will have on us and our clients. We cannot predict with certainty what effect the current U.S. presidential administration together with the U.S. Congress may have, if any, on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services. Further, regardless of the prevailing political environment in the United States, Medicare, Medicaid and managed care organizations are increasing pressure to both control healthcare utilization and to limit reimbursement. Changes in reimbursement programs or regulations, including retroactive and prospective rate and coverage criteria changes, competitive bidding for certain products and services, and other changes intended to reduce expenditures could adversely affect the portions of our clients\u2019 businesses that are dependent on third-party reimbursement or direct governmental payment. Moreover, to the extent that our clients experience reimbursement pressure resulting in lower revenue for them, their demand for our products and services might decrease. It is unclear what long-term effects the general economic conditions will have on the healthcare industry, and in turn, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nConsolidation in the industries in which our clients operate may result in certain clients discontinuing their use of our services following an acquisition or merger, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nMergers or consolidations among our clients have in the past and could in the future reduce the number of our existing and potential clients. When companies consolidate, overlapping services previously purchased separately are typically purchased only once by the combined entity, leading to loss of revenue for the service provider. If our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, they may discontinue their use of our services. There can be no assurance as to the degree to which we may be able to address the revenue impact of such consolidation. Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur services could become subject to new, revised, or enhanced regulatory requirements in the future, which could result in increased costs, could delay or prevent our introduction of new services, or could impair the function or value of our existing services, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated on the federal, state, and local levels, and is subject to changing legislative, regulatory, political, and other influences. Changes to existing laws and regulations, or the enactment of new laws or regulations affecting the healthcare industry, could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us or our clients to incur additional costs, could alter our clients\u2019 business models, and could restrict our or our clients\u2019 operations.\nMany healthcare laws are complex, subject to frequent change, and dependent on interpretation and enforcement decisions from government agencies and other adjudicatory bodies with broad discretion. The application of these laws to us, our clients, or the specific services and relationships we have with our clients is not always clear. In addition, federal and state legislatures have periodically enacted programs designed to reform or amend the U.S. healthcare system at both the federal and state level, such as the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the \u201cACA\u201d). The ACA included provisions to control health care costs, improve health care quality, and expand access to affordable health insurance. Together with ongoing statutory and budgetary policy developments at a federal level, this health care reform legislation could include changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment policies and other health care delivery administrative reforms that could potentially negatively impact the business of our clients. Because not all the administrative rules implementing health care reform under the legislation have been finalized, because of recent judicial action, because of ongoing federal fiscal budgetary pressures yet to be resolved for federal health programs, and because of the lack of implementing regulations or interpretive guidance, gradual and partially delayed implementation, possible amendment, repeal or further implementation delays, the full impact of the health care reform legislation and of further statutory actions to reform healthcare payment on our business and the business of our clients is unknown. Further, we expect that the current U.S. presidential administration together with the U.S. Congress will continue to seek to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the ACA. Any such changes will likely take time to be implemented and there can be no assurances that health care reform legislation will not adversely impact either our operational results or the manner in which we operate our business. Health care industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions, including investments in our\nplatforms, solutions and services. Our failure to anticipate accurately the application of these laws and similar or future laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with them, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business.\nOur services may become subject to new or enhanced regulatory requirements, and we may be required to change or adapt our services in order to comply with these regulations. If we fail to successfully implement new, enhanced or revised regulatory requirements, it could adversely affect our ability to offer services deemed critical by our clients, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. New or enhanced regulatory requirements may render our services obsolete or prevent us from performing certain services. New or enhanced regulatory requirements could impose additional costs on us, and thereby make existing services unprofitable, and could make the introduction of new services more costly or time-consuming than we anticipate, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nBecause personal, public, and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are subject to government regulation and vulnerable to adverse publicity concerning the use of our data.\nWe provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under HIPAA and, to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. However, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. They have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, including health information. As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. Similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we may do business in the future. The following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows:\n\u2022\namendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations that restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to clients;\n\u2022\nchanges in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions;\n\u2022\nfailure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nfailure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.\nOur estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. Our estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected growth of our aggregate market opportunity or any of the sub-components of our total addressable market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if our total addressable market or any sub-component thereof meets our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nOur proprietary applications may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to a variety of claims against us, or divert our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nProprietary software and application development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex, and may involve unforeseen difficulties. We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary applications from operating properly. If our applications and services do not function reliably or fail to achieve client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us and attempt to cancel their contracts with us. Moreover, material performance problems, defects, or errors in our existing or new applications and services may arise in the future and may result from, among other things, the lack of interoperability of our applications with systems and data that we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control or undetected in our testing. Defects or errors in our applications might discourage existing or potential clients from purchasing services from us. Correction of defects or errors could prove to be time consuming, costly, impossible, or impracticable. The existence of errors or defects in our applications and the correction of such errors could divert our resources from other matters relating to our business, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles, we might not be able to recognize revenue to offset expenditures, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our future operating results.\nThe sales cycle for our services is typically four to six months from initial contact to contract execution, but can vary depending on the particular client, product under consideration, and time of year, among other factors. Some clients, for instance, undertake a more prolonged evaluation process, which has in the past resulted in extended sales cycles. Our sales efforts involve educating\npotential clients about the use, technical capabilities, and benefits of our services, and gaining an understanding of their needs and budgets. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and resources, and we do not recognize any revenue to offset such expenditures, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and adversely affect our future operating results. In addition, we may be unable to enter into definitive contracts at the end of a sales cycle on terms that are favorable to us or at all, in some cases for reasons outside our control, which may materially adversely affect our ability to accurately forecast future growth which may cause our stock price to decline.\nAfter a client contract is signed, we provide an implementation process for the client during which we load, test, and integrate data into our system and train client personnel. Our implementation cycle generally ranges from 20 to 90 days from contract execution to completion of implementation, but can vary depending on the amount and quality of the client\u2019s data and how quickly the client facilitates access to data. In addition, for certain clients, our third-party vendors must go through delegation processes in order to become authorized to provide certain services to those clients, which could delay our ability to provide such services to those clients. During the implementation cycle, we expend time, effort, and financial resources implementing our services, but accounting principles do not allow us to recognize the resulting revenue until implementation is complete and the services are available for use by our clients. If implementation periods are extended, revenue recognition will be delayed, which could adversely affect our results of operations in certain periods.\nIn addition, because most of our revenue in each quarter is derived from agreements entered into with our clients during previous quarters, the negative impacts resulting from a decline in new or renewed agreements in any one quarter may not be fully reflected in our revenue for that quarter. Such declines, however, would negatively affect our revenue in future periods and the effect of significant downturns in sales of and market demand for our services, and potential changes in our renewal rates or renewal terms may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our sales and implementation cycles also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our total revenue through additional sales in any period. As a result, the effect of changes in the industry impacting our business, or changes we experience in our new sales, may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations.\nWe operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe operate in a competitive industry, and we expect that competition will increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies that provide similar services, including existing clients and other healthcare organizations that seek to build and operate competing services themselves and newer companies that provide similar services, often at substantially lower prices. We compete on the basis of various factors, including breadth and depth of services, reputation, reliability, quality, innovation, security, price, and industry expertise, and experience. If we are unable to maintain our technology, management, healthcare, or regulatory expertise or attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing leadership and support personnel, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. Some of our competitors, in particular health plans and larger technology or technology-enabled consultative service providers, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do. Furthermore, our current or potential competitors may have greater financial resources and larger sales and marketing capabilities than we have, and may have a more diversified set of revenue sources, which may allow them to be less sensitive to changes in client preferences and more aggressive in pricing their services, any of which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or client requirements and may have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. In addition, potential clients frequently have requested competitive bids from us and our competitors in terms of price and services offered and, if we do not accurately assess potential clients\u2019 needs and budgets when submitting our proposals, they may appear less attractive than those of our competitors, and we may not be successful in attracting new business. In addition, our clients may perceive our toolsets to be at a higher price point than our competitors, which could result in reduced revenue if we are not able to adequately demonstrate the value of our toolsets to our clients and prospective clients. Increases in competition in our industry could reduce our market share and result in price declines for certain services, which could negatively impact our business, profitability, and growth prospects.\nIf we fail to maintain awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner, our business might suffer.\nMaintaining awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to continuing the widespread acceptance of our existing services and is an important element in attracting new clients and in attracting and retaining qualified employees. The importance of brand recognition may increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices. Our efforts to build and maintain our brand nationally have involved and will continue to involve significant expense. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in maintaining our brand. In addition, third parties\u2019 use of trademarks or branding similar to ours could materially harm our business or result in litigation and other costs. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an\nunsuccessful attempt to maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new clients or retain our existing clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees could suffer.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary software, confidential information and know-how, technology, and other intellectual property and intellectual property rights. We rely generally on copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and third parties, and license and other agreements with consultants, vendors, and clients. There can be no assurance that employees, consultants, vendors, and clients have executed such agreements or have not breached or will not breach their agreements with us, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. Additionally, we monitor our use of open source software to avoid uses that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or violate applicable open source licenses, but if we engaged in such uses inadvertently, we could be required to take remedial action or release certain of our proprietary source code. These scenarios could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, despite the protections we do place on our intellectual property, a third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology, or develop similar technology. In addition, agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and might not be enforceable in certain cases.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2015, we filed a limited number of provisional and non-provisional patent applications, which may or may not result in an issued patent or patents. In addition, we do not know whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. To the extent that patents are issued from our patent applications, which are not certain, they may be contested, circumvented or invalidated in the future. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, may be successfully challenged by third parties, and, as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future.\nWe currently rely primarily on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information. Further, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our services and harm our business, the value of our investment in development or business acquisitions could be reduced, and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of their confidential or proprietary information.\nWe rely on our trademarks, service marks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our services from the services of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our services, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nOur ability to obtain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to uncertainty as to the scope of protection, registerability, patentability, validity, and enforceability of our intellectual property rights in each applicable jurisdiction, as well as the risk of general litigation or third-party oppositions.\nExisting U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection. Moreover, if we expand our business into markets outside of the United States, our intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection as they would in the United States because of the differences in foreign trademark and other laws concerning proprietary rights. Governments may adopt regulations, and government agencies or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights. When we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights we may be subject to claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions, impair the functionality of our solutions, delay introductions of new solutions, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our solutions, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLaws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which we provide our clients certain of our intervention toolsets, and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to penalties or require that we change the manner in which we provide such toolsets.\nAmong our intervention toolsets are supplemental patient encounters (\u201cSPEs\u201d). While some clients utilize our platform toolsets to conduct their own SPEs directly or through third-parties, some of our clients engage us to utilize our intervention platform toolsets to facilitate SPEs. In such cases, we use third-parties to undertake such SPEs utilizing our intervention platform toolsets or may utilize our own associate to undertake such SPEs. Certain of our SPEs may be considered patient care. Some states have laws that prohibit business entities from practicing medicine, employing providers to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by providers (also known collectively as the corporate practice of medicine). These laws, regulations, and interpretations have, in certain states, been subject to enforcement, as well as judicial and regulatory interpretation, and are subject to change.\nIn these states, we operate by maintaining long term contracts with affiliated physician groups, which are each owned and operated by physicians and which employ or contract with additional providers to perform the SPEs. If there were a determination that a corporate practice of medicine violation existed or exists, we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties or an injunction for practicing medicine without a license or aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of medicine. The occurrence of any of such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to provide our clients with the full array of our intervention toolsets.\nWe could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance.\nOur business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the provision of analytics and toolsets that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. If clients or individuals assert liability claims against us, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management\u2019s attention from operations, and decrease market acceptance of our toolsets. We attempt to limit our liability to clients by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract. We also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us, and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the software and healthcare technology and services industries are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and our competitors and other third parties may hold patents or have pending patent applications which could be related to our business. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties, which we refer to as non-practicing entities, whose primary business is to assert infringement claims or make royalty demands. Moreover, many of our current and potential competitors may dedicate substantially greater resources to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, especially patents. It is difficult to proceed with certainty in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be patent applications pending related to our technologies, many of which are confidential when filed.\nWe may receive in the future notices that claim we or our clients using our services have misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, particularly as the number of competitors in our market grows and the functionality of services among competitors overlaps. If we are sued by a third party that claims that our technology infringes its rights, the litigation, whether or not successful, could be extremely costly to defend, divert our management\u2019s time, attention, and resources, damage our reputation and brand, and substantially harm our business. We do not currently have a patent portfolio of our own, which may limit the defenses available to us in any such litigation.\nIn addition, in most instances, we have agreed to indemnify our clients against certain third-party claims, which may include claims that one of our services infringes the intellectual property rights of such third parties. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our clients, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our clients or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our services. In addition, our business could be adversely affected by any significant disputes between us and our clients as to the applicability or scope of our indemnification obligations to them. The results of any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may also require us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease offering or using technologies that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nmake substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments, or other costs or damages;\n\u2022\nobtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology; or\n\u2022\nredesign technology to avoid infringement, if feasible.\nIf we were to discover that our applications and services violate third-party proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses to continue offering those applications and services on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to redesign our technology to avoid infringement, or to avoid or settle litigation regarding alleged infringement without substantial expense and damage awards. Any claims against us relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and in injunctions preventing us from distributing certain products. If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our clients for such claims, such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends in large part upon the continued services of our key executive officers, including Dr. Dunleavy. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, services, and general and administrative functions. We can provide no assurances that any of our executive officers or key employees will continue their employment with us. The replacement of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees would likely involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nWe may fail to attract, train, and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations and growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect our business and growth strategy.\nThe success of our business and growth strategy depends on our ability to attract, train, and retain qualified employees, particularly technology personnel, subject matter experts, sales and marketing leadership and support personnel, and personnel with healthcare regulatory, clinical, and appropriate management expertise. The market for qualified employees in our industry and in the markets in which we operate is very competitive, and companies that we compete with for experienced personnel may have greater resources than we. In addition, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees depends in part on our ability to maintain awareness of our brand. If we are not successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful technologies and services and grow our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have previously and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, services, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our services, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, on October 1, 2016, we acquired Creehan, on July 6, 2017, we completed the acquisition of ComplexCare Solutions, Inc. and ComplexCare Solutions IPA, LLC (together, \u201cCCS\u201d), and on April 2, 2018, we acquired ABILITY. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. Acquisitions also could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business, including from Creehan, CCS, or ABILITY, due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ninability or difficulty integrating and benefiting from acquired technologies, services, or clients in a profitable manner, including as a result of reductions in operating income, increases in expenses, the failure to achieve anticipated synergies, or otherwise;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations, and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nadverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and clients as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nassuming potential liabilities of an acquired company;\n\u2022\npossibility of overpaying for acquisitions, particularly those with significant intangibles and those assets that derive value using novel tools or are involved in niche markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in acquiring suitable businesses, including challenges in predicting the value an acquisition will ultimately contribute to our business;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nthe need to understand local healthcare regulatory regimes.\nIf an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business, and financial condition may suffer materially.\nThe integration of newly acquired businesses, including Creehan, CCS, and ABILITY, will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management. The diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development, marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships. Moreover, even if we were able to fully integrate a new acquisition\u2019s business operations and other assets successfully, there can be no assurance that such integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible or were anticipated from the acquisition or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time. Delays in integrating our acquisitions, which could be caused by factors outside of our control, could adversely affect the intended benefits of the acquisitions to our business, financial results, financial condition and the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could adversely impact our financial results, and ineffective internal controls could adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. For more information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cNote 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These methods, estimates, and judgments are subject to significant risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and changes could affect our results of operations. In addition, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of the inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are obligated to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may harm investor confidence in our Company and, as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each Annual Report on Form 10-K. This assessment is required to include disclosure of material weaknesses, if any, identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure of our internal control over financial reporting to be effective or our failure to implement required new or improved controls, if any, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, including delaying or failing to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness, may harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, harm investor confidence, and negatively impact the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Board of Directors may change our strategies, policies, and procedures without stockholder approval and we may become more highly leveraged, which may increase our risk of default under our debt obligations.\nOur investment, financing, leverage, and dividend policies, and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, capitalization, and operations, are determined exclusively by our board of directors, and may be amended or revised at any time by our board of directors without notice to or a vote of our stockholders. This could result in us conducting operational matters, making investments, or pursuing different business or growth strategies than those contemplated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness, funded or otherwise, that we may incur. Higher leverage also increases the risk of default on our obligations. In addition, a change in our investment policies, including the manner in which we allocate our resources across our portfolio or the types of assets in which we seek to invest,\nmay increase our exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Changes to our policies with regards to the foregoing could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nFuture sales to clients outside the United States or use of third party vendors outside the United States might expose us to risks inherent in international operations which, if realized, could adversely affect our business.\nAn element of our growth strategy is to expand internationally. In addition, we intend to continue to utilize certain third-party vendors that are located outside of the United States. For example, we currently contract with a third-party vendor in India that provides IT support for certain of our operations. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the United States. Because of our limited experience with international operations, any international expansion efforts might not be successful in creating demand for our services outside of the United States or in effectively selling our services in the international markets we enter. In addition, we will face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\nthe need to localize and adapt our services for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles, and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nweaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting, and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, anti-bribery, foreign investment, tax, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nif we denominate our international contracts in local currencies, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies might impact our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars.\nOur business could be harmed by disruptions in network service or operational failures at our data centers (including our co-location facility) related to the storage, transmission and presentation of client data.\nOur success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our data centers and service provider locations. Interruptions in service or damage to locations may be caused by natural disasters, power loss, Internet or network failures, physical damage, operator error, security breaches, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, or similar events. The varied types and severity of the interruptions that could occur may render our safeguards inadequate. These service interruption events could result in the corruption or loss of data and impair the processing of data and our delivery of services to clients, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results. Furthermore, if any of our data centers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\nProblems faced by our third-party data center location, with the telecommunications network providers with whom we or it contract, or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their clients, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our clients and the security of the data.\nFurther, our ability to deliver our cloud-based services depends on the infrastructure of the Internet and a reliable network with the necessary speed, data capacity, bandwidth capacity, and security. Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments. We have, however, experienced, and may experience in the future, interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. An extended period of network unavailability could negatively impact our ability to deliver acceptable or accurate services, and negatively impact our relationship with clients, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party cloud capacity providers to efficiently scale our cloud-based solutions.\nAlthough substantially all of the computer hardware necessary to deliver our solutions, data and compute capacity is located and maintained in our owned data centers, we rely on third-party cloud capacity providers, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google cloud services, to efficiently scale our cloud-based solutions. The systems and operations of our third-party cloud based capacity providers could suffer damage or interruption as a result of human error, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, terrorist attacks, acts of war, and similar events. The occurrence of any such natural disaster,\nan act of terrorism or other unanticipated problems at our third-party cloud based capacity providers\u2019 hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Although our third-party cloud based capacity providers maintain backup facilities and disaster recovery services in the event of a system failure, these systems may be insufficient or fail. Any system failure, including network, software, or hardware failure, that causes an interruption in our use of third-party cloud capacity providers or that causes a decrease in responsiveness of our cloud-based solutions could damage our reputation and cause our customers and potential customers to believe that our service is unreliable, causing us to lose customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on agreements with third parties to provide certain services, goods, technology, and intellectual property rights necessary to enable us to implement some of our applications.\nOur ability to implement and provide our applications and services to our clients depends, in part, on services, goods, technology, and intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties, including one vendor from whom we purchase significant components of our storage architecture. These third parties may become unable to or refuse to continue to provide these services, goods, technology, or intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms consistent with our business practices, or otherwise discontinue a service important for us to continue to operate our applications. If we fail to replace these services, goods, technologies, or intellectual property rights in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, we exercise limited control over our third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with technology and services those vendors provide. If the services, technology, or intellectual property of third parties were to fail to perform as expected, it could subject us to potential liability, adversely affect our renewal rates, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reliance on third-party vendors to perform certain of our intervention toolsets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe rely in part on third-party vendors to perform certain of our intervention toolsets, including supplemental patient encounters such as in-home encounters. These third parties may not perform their obligations to us in a timely and cost-effective manner, in compliance with applicable regulations, or in a manner that is in our and our clients\u2019 best interests, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and our ability to retain and attract clients. In addition, our growth depends in part on the ability of our third-party vendors to leverage our intervention toolsets to a larger group of clients. If our third-party vendors do not perform their services at a level acceptable to us or our clients or if they are unable to leverage our intervention toolsets to a larger group of clients, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nWe are currently the subject of purported securities class action lawsuits and additional litigation may be brought against us in the future.\nWe are currently the subject of two consolidated purported class action lawsuits which assert violations of Section 11, Section 12, and Section 15 of the Securities Act based on allegedly false or misleading statements and omissions in our Registration Statement issued in connection with our initial public offering on February 18, 2015. These lawsuits seek certification as a class and unspecified compensatory damages plus interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. On January 23, 2019, the parties informed the court that they had accepted a mediator\u2019s recommendation on the amount of a settlement of these lawsuits, subject to agreement on the terms and settlement documentation. On the same day, the court stayed all proceedings for a period of not more than 60 days to enable the parties to finalize the settlement and settlement documentation and move for preliminary approval of the settlement. On February 20, 2019, the parties executed a settlement agreement, which is subject to court approval, provides for the dismissal of all claims against the defendants in connection with the securities class action suit, and provides for a payment to the class of $17 million, of which the Company has agreed to contribute $1.7 million, with the remaining amounts to be paid by the Company\u2019s insurance carriers. There can be no assurance that such agreement will be approved by the court, that individual claimants will not opt out of the class and pursue individual claims, that the Company can overcome any objections or appeals regarding the settlement, or that all conditions to the settlement agreement will be satisfied. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such current and additional litigation, if any, including in the form of stockholder derivative actions against our Board of Directors, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects and cause our stock price to decline.\nOur debt may restrict our future operations.\nWe have substantial debt and have the ability to incur additional debt. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $977.6 million of outstanding principal indebtedness. Our incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have significant consequences. For instance, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which will reduce funds available for other business purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared with some of our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.\nOur 2018 Credit Agreement and the terms of our other debt instruments, including agreements relating to debt we may incur in the future, contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For instance, these covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; create additional liens, merge or consolidate; make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions; make certain restricted payments; or enter into transactions with affiliates. In addition, our 2018 Credit Agreement requires that we comply with certain financial ratios, including a maximum senior secured net leverage ratio test. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be adversely affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach, or alleged breach, of any of these covenants could result in a default and our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the secured lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our indebtedness.\nOur failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect results of operations.\nOur 2018 Term Facility currently bears interest at variable rates and we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. Accordingly, increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could reduce net earnings and cash available for payment of our debt obligations. We currently manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate swap agreements and may in the future use additional interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest cap agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate increases and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs, and our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use may not completely offset the risks of interest rate volatility and may result in or magnify losses. Furthermore, interest rate derivatives may not be available at all, or at favorable terms, particularly during economic downturns. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our Class A common stock.\nOur quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, cost of revenue, net income, and cash flows, may vary significantly in the future, and sequential quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. In addition to the other risk factors included in this section, some of the important factors that may cause sequential quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our operating results include:\n\u2022\nseasonal variations driven primarily by regulatory timelines have historically caused a significantly higher proportion of our services to be performed, and therefore revenues and costs to be recognized, during the second and, to a lesser extent, the fourth quarters of the year compared to the first and, most significantly, the third quarter, (quarter to quarter financial performance may increasingly vary from historical seasonal trends as we further expand into adjacent markets and increase the portion of our revenue generated from new offerings);\n\u2022\npossible delays in the expected recognition of revenue due to lengthy and sometimes unpredictable sales and implementation timelines;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of introductions of new applications and services by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, clients, or strategic partners;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of large clients, including through acquisitions or consolidations of such clients;\n\u2022\nnetwork outages or security breaches;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new clients;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry, and market conditions;\n\u2022\nclient renewal rates and the timing and terms of client renewals;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe mix of applications and services sold during a period; and\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses.\nAny fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may not accurately reflect the underlying longer-term performance of our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nBecause the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with holders of our Class B common stock, holders of our Class B common stock, including Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Hoffmann, have significant influence over us, including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for a vote.\nWe are currently controlled by holders of our Class B common stock. As of January 31, 2019, holders of our Class B common stock beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 92% of the voting power of our common stock. In particular, Dr. Dunleavy beneficially owns an aggregate of approximately 63% of the voting power of our common stock, and Mr. Hoffmann beneficially owns an aggregate of approximately 22% of the voting power of our common stock. The shares beneficially owned by Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Hoffmann and certain other stockholders are shares of Class B common stock, which have 10 votes per share, whereas each share of Class A common stock has one vote per share. As long as holders of our Class B common stock control at least a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, they will have the ability to exercise substantial control over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board of directors, any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Even if their ownership falls below 50%, holders of our Class B common stock will continue to be able to exert significant influence or effectively control our decisions because of the dual class structure of our common stock. This concentrated control by our Class B common stockholders will limit or preclude your ability to influence those corporate matters for the foreseeable future and, as a result, we may take actions that holders of our Class A common stock do not view as beneficial. This dual class structure may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, this structure may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nWe incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a publicly traded company, we incur significant legal, accounting, stockholder communication, and other expenses and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing tax laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, and the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls, changes in corporate governance practices, and required filing of annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. In particular, we incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and new regulations issued by the SEC are creating additional disclosure obligations for public companies. We may need to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving standards, which may result in increased expenses and a diversion of management time. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our Class A common stock, fines, sanctions, and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe stock price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquire shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock include the following:\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results that we provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of shares of our Class B common stock by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new services or enhancements to services, acquisitions, strategic alliances, or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our services due to computer hardware, software, or network problems or a security breach;\n\u2022\nannouncements of client additions and client cancellations or delays in client purchases;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole or market conditions in our industry and the industries of our clients;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nthe size of our market float; and\n\u2022\nany other factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and materially adversely affect our business.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock.\nAlthough we have paid cash dividends on our common stock in the past, we currently intend to invest any future earnings to finance the operation and growth of our business and do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in shares of our Class A common stock will depend upon future appreciation in its value, if any, and there is no guarantee that shares of our Class A common stock will appreciate in value.\nDelaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally a stockholder, who together with affiliates and associates, owns 15% or more of our voting rights) for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe have a dual class common stock structure, which could provide the holders of our Class B common stock, including our executive officers, directors, and their affiliates, with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\n\u2022\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 10% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock, certain amendments to our restated bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the voting power of our then-outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 10% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\n\u2022\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 10% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\n\u2022\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 10% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nonly our chairman, our chief executive officer, a majority of our board of directors, or stockholders holding shares representing at least 50% of the combined voting power of our Class A common Stock and Class B common stock will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders until the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 10% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock, at which time only our chairman, our chief executive officer, or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures will apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nour restated certificate of incorporation authorized up to 100,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to certain exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our shares, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, the share price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the share price or trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us, express views regarding us that may be perceived as negative or less favorable than previous views, downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, the share price of our Class A common stock could decline.", "PERMNO": 15220, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "INOV"}
