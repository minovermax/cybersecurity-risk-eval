{"cik": "1017793", "company": "SUN BANCORP INC /NJ/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe following is a summary of the material risks related to our business and an investment in the Company\u2019s securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nChallenges in increasing revenues and profits.\nNet interest income is the primary source of income for us. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net interest income of $60.6 million represented 81.9% of our total revenues. Growth of our net interest income is highly dependent on increases in outstanding commercial loans. If our anticipated loan production cannot be achieved due to the competitive nature of the market or pay downs are elevated, then net interest income will not increase. In addition, if the cost of funds is not properly managed in an increasing rate environment, net interest income could decline.\nNon-interest income, which totaled $13.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, is a significant source of revenue for the Company and an important component of the Company\u2019s results of operations. Increasing fee and service charge revenue could be challenging as a result of changing consumer behavior and the impact of changes in regulations. Key drivers of bank fees and service charges are the number of deposit accounts and related transaction activity. We may not be able to expand our market presence in our existing market areas or successfully enter new markets. If we cannot increase the number of our deposit customers, non-interest income will not improve.\nA weak economy, low demand and competition for credit may impact our ability to successfully execute our growth plan and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and growth prospects. While we believe we have the executive management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or that we will successfully manage our growth.\nIncreases in nonperforming assets will have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur nonperforming assets (which consist of nonaccrual loans, assets acquired through foreclosure and troubled debt restructurings), totaled $3.1 million at December 31, 2016 as compared to $3.4 million at December 31, 2015 and $15.7 million at December 31, 2014. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans and assets acquired through foreclosure. We must establish an allowance for loan losses that reserves for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable through current period provisions for loan losses. From time to time, we also write down the value of properties in our portfolio of assets acquired through foreclosure to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to assets acquired through foreclosure. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract management from its overall supervision of operations and other income producing activities. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance for loan losses accordingly, which will have an adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience future increases in non-performing assets.\nA natural disaster could harm our business.\nNatural disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The occurrence of a natural disaster could result in one or more of the following: (1) an increase in delinquent loans; (2) an increase in problem assets and foreclosures; (3) a decrease in the demand for our products and services; or\n(4) a decrease in the value of the collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage.\nThe occurrence of any failure, breach, or interruption in service involving our systems or those of our service providers, including as a result of a cyber-attack, could damage our reputation, cause losses, increase our expenses, and result in a loss of customers, an increase in regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possibly financial liability, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our stock.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger, our deposits and our loans. In the normal course of our business, we collect, process, retain and transmit (by email and other electronic means) sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others. We also outsource certain aspects of our data processing to certain third-party providers. In addition to confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others, we, and in some cases a third party, compile, process, transmit and store proprietary, non-public information concerning our business, operations, plans and strategies. As a result, our business and operations depend on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third party service providers. Although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security measures and business continuity programs, our facilities, computer systems, software and networks, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have a security impact. In addition, breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our confidential or other information or the confidential or other information of our customers, clients or counterparties. While we regularly review security assessments that were conducted on our third party service providers that have access to sensitive and confidential information, there can be no assurance that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, nation states, and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly distributed denial of service attacks that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as customer-facing web sites. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources.\nWe use a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions and security breaches and to protect confidential information from mishandling, misuse or loss, including detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents. However, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be promptly detected and adequately addressed if they do, and early detection of security breaches may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection. If there is a failure in or breach of our computer systems or networks, or those of a third-party service provider, the confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, such computer systems and networks could potentially be jeopardized, or could otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers, clients or counterparties.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could subject us to litigation or regulatory scrutiny, cause us significant reputational damage or erode confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, cause us to lose customers or have greater difficulty in attracting new customers, have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock or subject us to financial losses that are either not insured or not fully covered by insurance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, as information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance or modify our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks.\nWeakness in the economic and banking environments have posed significant challenges for us in the past and an economic downturn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy in general. Our financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the U.S. as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability, or increases in the cost, of credit and capital, changes in the rate of\ninflation, changes in interest rates, high unemployment, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, global economic conditions and geopolitical factors, or a combination of these or other factors. In the past, national, regional and local economic challenges have negatively impacted our financial condition. In particular, declines in the housing market, increases in unemployment and under-employment have negatively impacted the credit performance of loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including the Bank. While the economic environment has improved recently, a future downturn in the economy may further impact the Bank\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. For example, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or changes in interest rates, as well as other factors, such as a substantial decline in the stock market, could weaken the economies of the communities the Bank serves and expose us to the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u2022\nLoan delinquencies could increase;\n\u2022\nProblem assets and foreclosures could increase;\n\u2022\nDemand for our products and services could decline;\n\u2022\nCollateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, could decline in value, in turn reducing a customer\u2019s borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans; and\n\u2022\nInvestments in mortgage-backed securities could decline in value as a result of the performance of the underlying loans or the diminution of the value of the underlying real estate collateral pressing the government sponsored agencies to honor its guarantees to principal and interest.\nIf these conditions or similar ones occur, we may experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and recent rulemaking, we are now subject to more stringent capital requirements\nThe federal bank regulatory agencies adopted the Final Capital Rules, which amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Company and the Bank. The Final Capital Rules implement the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Final Capital Rules, among other things, (i) established a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% and (ii) increased the Tier 1 capital ratio to 6% (from 4%). In addition, the Final Capital Rules added a requirement to maintain a minimum Conservation Buffer of 2.5% above these new regulatory minimum capital ratios. Under the Final Capital Rules, an institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. The Final Capital Rules are described in more detail in \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d above. The failure to meet the established capital requirements could result in the federal bank regulatory agencies placing limitations or conditions on our activities or restricting the commencement of new activities, and such failure could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limiting our ability to pay dividends; issuing a directive to increase our capital; and terminating our FDIC deposit insurance.\nThe occurrence of various events may adversely affect our ability to fully utilize net operating losses or recover our deferred tax asset.\nIn recent years, we experienced substantial operating losses. Under Section 172 (\u201cSection 172\u201d) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and rules promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, we may \u201ccarry forward\u201d our net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) in certain circumstances to offset any current and future earnings and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. To the extent that the NOLs do not otherwise become limited, we believe that we will be able to carry forward a significant amount of the NOLs, and therefore these NOLs could be a substantial asset to us. If, however, we experience an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code, our ability to use the NOLs may be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the NOLs could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset.\nIn general, an ownership change occurs when, as of any testing date, the percentage of stock of a corporation owned by one or more \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d as defined in Section 382(k) and the related Treasury Regulations, has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock of the corporation owned by such shareholder at any time during the three year period preceding such date. In general, persons who own 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s stock are 5-percent shareholders, and all other persons who own less than 5% of a corporation\u2019s stock are treated, together, as a single, public group 5-percent shareholder, regardless of whether they own an aggregate of 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s stock. However, U.S. Treasury regulations provide circumstances which result in multiple public group 5-percent shareholders. If a corporation experiences an ownership change, it is generally subject to an annual limitation in the use of NOLs, which limits its ability to use its NOLs to an amount equal to the equity value of the corporation multiplied by the federal long-term tax-exempt rate.\nIf we were to experience an ownership change, we could potentially have, in the future, higher United States federal income tax liabilities than we would otherwise have had and it may also result in certain other adverse tax consequences to us.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company partially reversed a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset, increasing its fourth quarter net income by $53.7 million. The Company made this determination based upon a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s completion of eight consecutive quarters of profitability, its demonstrated ability to meet or exceed budgets, its forecast of future profitability under multiple scenarios that support the partial utilization of NOLs prior to their expiration between 2017 through 2035 and improvements in credit risk management and credit quality measures that have resulted in reduced credit risk and improve management\u2019s ability to forecast future credit losses, among others. At December 31, 2016, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of $73.2 million against its gross deferred tax asset. The release of this remaining valuation allowance would have a positive impact on earnings and capital but is dependent on our continued ability to provide positive evidence of a return to sustained profitability. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to sustain our recent profitability, or accelerate it to the extent necessary to be able to utilize all of the NOLs we have generated, or that the conditions that led to our losses will not return. Our ability to generate sustained profitability in the amounts necessary to realize our deferred tax assets against future taxable income depends upon general economic and market conditions, interest rates, and our ability to meet our strategic plans. In addition, if we are unable to generate adequate sustained profitability, we may be required to record a new valuation allowance against some or all of our deferred tax assets, which would negatively impact our financial results. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to when we will again be in a position to recapture the remaining benefits of our deferred tax asset.\nGovernmental regulation and regulatory actions against us may impair our operations or restrict our growth.\nWe are subject to significant governmental supervision and regulation by the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC. These regulations are also designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers, but not for the benefit of our shareholders. Banking laws and regulations change from time to time. Bank regulations can hinder our ability to compete with financial services companies that are not regulated in the same manner or are less regulated. Federal and state bank regulatory agencies regulate many aspects of our operations. These areas include:\n\u2022\nThe capital that must be maintained;\n\u2022\nThe kinds of activities that we can engage in;\n\u2022\nThe kinds and amounts of investments that we can make;\n\u2022\nThe locations of our offices;\n\u2022\nInsurance of deposits and the premiums that we must pay for this insurance; and\n\u2022\nHow much cash we must set aside as reserves for deposits.\nIn addition, we are subject to regulations regarding corporate governance and permissible business activities, acquisition and merger restrictions, limitations on intercompany transactions, capital adequacy requirements and requirements for anti-money laundering programs and other compliance matters. In addition, in September 2016, the CFPB and OCC entered into a consent order with a large national bank alleging widespread improper sales practices, which prompted the federal bank regulatory agencies to conduct a horizontal review of sales practices throughout the banking industry. The elevated attention likely will result in continued additional regulatory scrutiny and regulation of incentive arrangements, which could adversely impact the delivery of services and increase compliance costs. As a result of the financial crisis which occurred in the banking and financial markets beginning in 2007, the overall bank regulatory climate is now marked by caution, conservatism and a renewed focus on compliance and risk management. Overall compliance with the applicable regulations increases our operating expenses, requires a significant amount of management\u2019s attention and could be a competitive disadvantage with respect to nonregulated competitors.\nOur failure to comply with applicable regulations, or the failure to develop, implement and comply with corrective action plans to address any identified areas of noncompliance, may result in the assessment of fines and penalties and the commencement of informal or formal regulatory enforcement actions against us. Any remedial measure or enforcement action, whether formal or informal, could impose further restrictions on our ability to operate our business and adversely affect our prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any formal enforcement action could harm our reputation and our ability to retain and attract customers and impact the trading price of our common stock. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe financial services industry, as well as the broader economy, may be subject to new legislation, regulation, and government policy.\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that will result from the combination of a new\nPresident of the United States and the first year since 2010 in which both Houses of Congress and the White House have majority memberships from the same political party. In recent years, however, both the new President and senior members of the House of Representatives have advocated for significant reduction of financial services regulation, to include amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and structural changes to the CFPB. The new Administration and Congress also may cause broader economic changes due to changes in governing ideology and governing style. New appointments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve could affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, our results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nThe market value of our securities portfolio may be impacted by the level of interest rates and the credit quality and strength of the underlying issuers.\nIf a decline in market value of a security is determined to be other-than-temporary, under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we are required to write these securities down to their estimated fair value through a charge to earnings. At December 31, 2016, we owned one non-rated single issuer trust preferred security classified as available for sale with an amortized cost of $3.2 million and estimated fair value of $3.2 million on which the cumulative other-than-temporary impairment is $1.2 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company did not recognize a credit related impairment loss on this security in 2016, 2015 or 2014. We perform an ongoing analysis of this security. Future changes in interest rates or the credit quality and strength of the underlying issuers may reduce the market value of this and other securities we own from time to time.\nOur loan portfolio includes a substantial amount of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. The credit risk related to these types of loans is greater than the risk related to residential loans.\nOur commercial loan portfolio, which include commercial real estate loans, totaled $1.28 billion at December 31, 2016, comprising approximately 79% of our total gross loans held-for-investment. Commercial loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a greater degree of risk of nonpayment or late payment than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans.\nFurthermore, commercial real estate loans secured by owner-occupied properties are dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business. If the operating company suffers difficulties in terms of sales volume and/or profitability, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Loans secured by properties where repayment is dependent upon payment of rent by third party tenants or the sale of the property may be impacted by loss of tenants, lower lease rates needed to attract new tenants or the inability to sell a completed project in a timely fashion and at a profit. Our failure to adequately implement enhanced risk management policies, procedures and controls could result in an increased rate of delinquencies, increased losses from these portfolios and adversely affect our ability to increase our commercial real estate loan portfolio going forward. The collateral for our commercial loans that are secured by real estate are classified as 36% owner-occupied properties and 64% non-owner occupied properties.\nOverall, our market has expanded within the State of New Jersey and in the State of New York. Likewise, our commercial lending activities have grown, especially in the central and more recently the northern parts of New Jersey. In recent years, commercial real estate markets have been experiencing substantial growth, and increased competitive pressures have contributed significantly to historically low capitalization rates and rising property values. Commercial real estate prices, according to many U.S. commercial real estate indices, are currently above the 2007 peak levels that contributed to the financial crisis. Accordingly, the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as some market analysts, have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current commercial real estate market. A significant broad based deterioration in economic conditions throughout New Jersey and New York, including the real estate markets, could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios and, consequently, on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to provide an adequate allowance for loan losses, there could be a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe risk of loan losses varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the value of the collateral for the loan. Based upon factors such as historical experience, an evaluation of economic conditions and a regular review of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses was approximately $15.5 million which represented approximately 0.97% of total loans held-for-investment and approximately 501% of nonperforming loans held-for-investment. If management\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate to absorb future credit losses, or if the federal bank regulatory agencies require us to increase our allowance for loan losses,\nour financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be significantly and adversely affected. Although we attempt to mitigate the credit risks associated with our underwriting standards and collection procedures, these standards and procedures may not offer adequate protection against the risk of default, especially in periods of economic uncertainty and high unemployment. Given that the components of the allowance for loan losses are based partially on historical losses and on risk rating changes in response to recent events, required reserves may trail the emergence of any unforeseen deterioration in credit quality.\nThe FASB\u2019s recently adopted ASU 2016-13 will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held-for-investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The new CECL standard will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our accounting, but we expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. We cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCompetition from other financial institutions in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing various financial services may adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nThe market areas in which we operate are among the most highly competitive in the country. There is substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting and retaining deposits. The competition comes principally from other banks (both larger and smaller), savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and the myriad of nonbanking competitors, such as full service brokerage firms, money market mutual funds, insurance companies and other institutional lenders. U.S. government involvement in banking and mortgage banking, through regulation and examination, a sustained low interest rate environment and rapidly evolving traditional and non-traditional competition in our marketplace, have combined to adversely impact current and projected operating results. The U.S. government\u2019s intervention in the mortgage and credit markets has resulted in a narrowing of mortgage spreads, lower yields and accelerated mortgage prepayments. We have commercial real estate lending and business banking operations, and these business lines are also being aggressively pursued by a number of competitors, both large and small. In addition, in December 2016, the OCC announced that it would begin considering applications from financial technology companies to become special purpose national banks and requested comments about how it can foster responsible innovation in the chartering process while continuing to provide robust oversight.\nUltimately, competition may adversely affect the rates we pay on deposits and charges on loans, thereby potentially adversely affecting our profitability and results of operations.\nWe rely on other companies to provide certain services and key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide certain services and key components of our business infrastructure, including certain of our fee income services such as cash management services. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled people. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our markets and years of industry experience. In addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed existing management and other key personnel. The replacement of our management team or other key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs, and the loss of these employees could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nChanges in interest rates may reduce our profits.\nThe most significant component of net income is net interest income, which accounted for 81% of our total revenue in 2016. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income generated on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest expense paid on the funds required to support interest-earning assets, namely deposits and borrowed funds. Interest income, which represents income from loans, investment securities and short-term investments is dependent on many factors including the volume of interest-earning assets, the level of interest rates, the interest rate sensitivity of the interest-earning assets and the levels of nonperforming loans. The cost of funds is a function of the amount and type of funds required to support the interest-earning assets, the rates paid to attract and retain deposits, rates paid on borrowed funds and the levels of non-interest bearing demand deposits.\nInterest rate sensitivity is a measure of how our assets and liabilities react to changes in market interest rates. We expect that this interest sensitivity will not always be perfectly balanced. This means that either our interest-earning assets will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest bearing liabilities, or vice versa. If more interest-earning assets than interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature during a time when interest rates are declining, then our net interest income may be reduced. If more interest-bearing liabilities than interest-earning assets reprice or mature during a time when interest rates are rising, then our net income may be reduced.\nInterest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the policies of the FRB. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including the available for sale securities portfolio, and (iii) the average duration of our interest-earning assets. Changes in monetary policy could also expose us to the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk), including a prolonged flat or inverted yield curve environment. Any substantial, unexpected and prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the goodwill that we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions becomes impaired, there could be a negative impact on our profitability.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the company\u2019s net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer\u2019s balance sheet as goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. At December 31, 2016, we had $38.2 million of goodwill on our balance sheet. Companies must evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually.\nWrite-downs of the amount of any impairment are to be charged to the results of operations in the period in which the impairment is determined. No impairment was identified in 2016. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in determinations of impairments and write-downs which could have an adverse non-cash impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nTrading volume of our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies which may adversely affect the market price and limit shareholders\u2019 ability to quickly and easily sell their common stock, particularly in large quantities.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading volume is less than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the price of our common stock to decline. As a result, shareholders may find it difficult to sell a significant number of shares at the prevailing market price.\nThe terms of the securities purchase agreements grant certain rights to specific investors that other shareholders do not have.\nPursuant to securities purchase agreements dated July 7, 2010 (the \u201c2010 Securities Purchase Agreements\u201d), entered into between the Company and each of an affiliate of WL Ross & Co., LLC, Siguler Guff & Company, LP, certain members and affiliates of the Brown family and certain other institutional and accredited investors (collectively, the \u201cInvestors\u201d), the Company granted each of the Investors certain \u201cgross-up\u201d rights in connection with certain securities offerings that the Company may conduct at the same price (net of underwriting discounts) and on the same terms as those proposed in the offering in an aggregate amount sufficient to enable them to maintain their respective ownership interest in us.\nWe may issue additional equity securities, or engage in other transactions which dilute our book value or affect the priority of the common stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors may determine from time to time that we need to raise additional capital by issuing additional shares of our common stock or other securities. Except pursuant to the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings may be affected. Such offerings could be dilutive to common shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or protection against dilution. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, our then current common shareholders.\nOur directors and executive officers and their affiliates own approximately 45% of the outstanding common stock. As a result of their combined ownership, our directors and executive officers could make it more difficult to obtain approval for some matters submitted to a shareholder vote, including acquisitions of our Company. The results of the vote may be contrary to the desires or interests of the other shareholders.\nDirectors and executive officers and their affiliates own approximately 45% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company at December 31, 2016, excluding shares which may be acquired upon the exercise of stock options or upon the vesting of restricted stock units. By voting against a proposal submitted to shareholders, the directors and officers, as a group, may be able to make approval more difficult for proposals requiring the vote of shareholders, such as some mergers, share exchanges, asset sales, and amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nProvisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the New Jersey Business Corporation Act could deter takeovers which are opposed by the Board of Directors.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires the approval of 80% of our outstanding shares for any merger or consolidation unless the transaction meets certain fair price criteria or the business combination has been approved or authorized by the Board of Directors. As a New Jersey corporation with a class of securities registered with the SEC, we are governed by certain provisions of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act that also restrict business combinations with shareholders owning 10% or more of our outstanding shares (\u201cinterested shareholders\u201d) for a period of five years after such interested shareholder achieves such status unless the business combination is approved by the Board of Directors prior to the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder. The New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act also restricts business combinations with an interested shareholder after the five-year period unless the transaction receives the approval of two-thirds of the shares outstanding, exclusive of the shares held by the interested shareholder or the transaction satisfies certain fair price requirements. In addition, with certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring\nmore than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of any banking holding company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the FRB.\nWe are subject to various restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders and to receive capital distributions from the Bank.\nIn January 2017, our Board of Directors declared our third consecutive quarterly cash dividend, payable in March 2017. The dividend is a reflection of our recent trend of generating positive net income from operations. However, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends. As a bank holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations. Further, the Bank is limited in the payment of dividends without the approval of the OCC of a total amount not to exceed the net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years. Federal law also prohibits national banks from paying dividends that would be greater than the bank\u2019s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Due to the Bank\u2019s history of losses, any proposed dividends from the Bank to the Company are subject to regulatory approval until such time as net income for the current year combined with the prior two years is sufficient and until the Bank returns to recording overall retained earnings as opposed to the current retained deficit. In addition, federal law permits the Bank to distribute cash or other assets to the Company through a reduction of capital, subject to approval by the OCC. Under the FDICIA, an insured depository institution such as the Bank is prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become \u201cundercapitalized\u201d (as such term is used in the FDICIA). Payment of dividends by the Bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the OCC if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice.\nAny payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, regulatory restrictions, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends to our shareholders in the future.", "PERMNO": 83903, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SNBC"}
