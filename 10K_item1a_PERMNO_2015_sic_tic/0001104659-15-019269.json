{"cik": "275053", "company": "NATURES SUNSHINE PRODUCTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks in evaluating our Company and our business. The risks described below are the risks that we currently believe are material to our business. However, additional risks not presently known to us, or risks that we currently believe are not material, may also impair our business operations. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this report, including the information set forth in \u201cBusiness\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d as well as our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the following risks. If we are adversely affected by such risks, then the market price of our common stock could decline.\nChanges in laws and regulations regarding direct selling may prohibit or restrict our ability to sell our products in some markets.\nDirect selling systems are frequently subject to laws and regulations by various government agencies throughout the world. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive practices and to ensure that sales are made to consumers of the products, and that compensation, recognition and advancement within the selling organization are based upon sales of the products. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties. Violations could result from misconduct by an associate, ambiguity in statutes, changes or new laws and regulations affecting our business and court-related decisions. Furthermore, we may be restricted or prohibited from using direct selling plans in some foreign countries. In addition, changes in existing laws or additional regulations could make it difficult to register or sell our products in the countries in which we operate. For example, in Peru, changes in local regulations have restricted our ability to sell a majority of our key products in this market through our traditional direct selling business model. In response to this change in regulations, in 2014, we transitioned this market to an export market, in which we sell our products to a locally managed entity independent of the Company that has distribution rights for the market.\nOur products, business practices and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulations and could be subject to additional laws and regulations.\nThe formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sales of each of our major product groups are subject to regulation by numerous domestic and foreign governmental agencies and authorities. These include the FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the EPA, the USDA and state regulatory agencies as well as regulatory agencies in the foreign markets in which we operate. These markets have varied regulations which often require us to reformulate products for specific markets, conform product labeling to market regulations and register or qualify products or obtain necessary approvals with the applicable governmental authorities in order to market our products in these markets. Failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of these various governmental agencies and authorities could result in enforcement actions including: cease and desist orders, injunctions, limits on advertising, consumer redress, divestitures of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these regulations could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any action against us could materially affect our ability to successfully market our products.\nIn the future, we may be subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA or other federal, state, local or foreign regulatory authorities, the repeal or amendment of laws or regulations which we consider favorable and/or more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. We can neither predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business. They could, however, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, imposition of additional record-keeping requirements, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or altered labeling and/or scientific substantiation. Any or all such requirements could increase our costs of operating the business and have a material negative impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products in the United States, has in the past several years instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement and food companies and against manufacturers of weight loss products generally for false and misleading advertising of some of their products. In addition, the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials, which we also utilize, as well as the role of expert endorsers and product clinical studies. We cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question our advertising or other operations in the future. It is unclear whether the FTC will subject our advertisements to increased surveillance to ensure compliance with the principles set forth in its published advertising guidance\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions. The Company expends significant resources to monitor FCPA compliance by its employees and representatives. Nevertheless, a finding of FCPA noncompliance could subject the Company to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses, as well as reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general. Assertions that we failed to comply with regulations or the effect of adverse regulations in one market could adversely affect us in other markets as well, by causing increased regulatory scrutiny in those other markets or as a result of the negative publicity generated in those other markets.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain Distributors, our business could suffer.\nWe rely on our independent Distributors to market and sell our products through direct selling techniques, as well as sponsoring other independent Distributors. Many independent Distributors sell our products on a part-time basis to friends or associates or use the products for themselves. Our independent Distributors may terminate their service at any time, and, like most direct selling companies, we experience high turnover among independent Distributors from year to year. As a result, we need to continue to retain existing independent Distributors and recruit additional independent Distributors in order to maintain and/or increase sales in the future.\nSeveral factors affect our ability to attract and retain independent Distributors, including:\n\u00b7 any adverse publicity regarding us, our products, our distribution channels or our competitors;\n\u00b7 on-going motivation of our independent Distributors;\n\u00b7 the public\u2019s perceptions about the value and efficacy of our products;\n\u00b7 the public\u2019s perceptions and acceptance of direct selling;\n\u00b7 general and economic business conditions;\n\u00b7 government regulations;\n\u00b7 changes to our compensation arrangements, training and support for our independent Distributors; and\n\u00b7 competition in recruiting and retaining independent Distributors and/or market saturation.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that our independent Distributors will continue to maintain their current levels of productivity, or that we will be able to continue to attract and retain independent Distributors in sufficient numbers to sustain future growth or to maintain present sales levels.\nChanges in the economies of the markets in which we do business may affect consumer demand for our products.\nConsumer spending habits, including spending for our products, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, fuel prices, salaries and wages, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. Economic slowdowns in the markets in which we do business and an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer spending habits and customer traffic, which may result in lower net sales of our products in future periods. A prolonged global or regional economic downturn could have a material negative impact on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations affect our net revenue and net income.\nIn 2014, we recognized approximately 59.5 percent of our revenue in markets outside the United States, the majority of which was recognized in each market\u2019s respective local currency. We purchase inventory primarily in the United States in U.S. dollars. In preparing our financial statements, we translate revenues and expenses in foreign countries from their local currencies into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. Because a majority of our sales are in foreign countries, exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant effect on our sales and earnings. Our reported net earnings have in the past been, and are likely to continue to be, significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, with net sales revenue and earnings generally increasing with a weaker U.S. dollar and decreasing with a strengthening U.S. dollar. These fluctuations had a generally negative effect on our revenue in 2014 and 2013, compared to 2012, when we experienced an increase in our global net sales as a result of the U.S. dollar weakening against most major currencies. As our operations grow in countries where foreign currency transactions are made, our operating results will increasingly be subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations, and we may not be able to accurately estimate the impact of these changes on our future results of operations or financial condition.\nSome of the markets in which we operate may become highly inflationary.\nInflation is another risk associated with our international operations. For example, Belarus has been designated as highly inflationary economy under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). Accordingly, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our operations in Belarus. All gains and losses resulting from the re-measurement of its financial statements and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in its earnings, which could result in volatility within the Company\u2019s earnings, rather than as a component of comprehensive income within shareholders\u2019 equity.\nSome of the markets in which we operate have currency controls in place which may restrict the repatriation of cash.\nThe possibility that foreign governments may impose currency remittance restrictions is another risk faced by our international operations. Due to the possibility of government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates, we may not be able to repatriate cash at exchange rates beneficial to the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For example, in 2014, the Company ceased its operations in Venezuela due to the difficulties and uncertainties related to import controls, difficulties associated with repatriating cash and high inflation.\nAvailability and integrity of raw materials could become compromised.\nWe depend on outside suppliers for raw materials. We acquire all of our raw materials for the manufacture of our products from third-party suppliers. We have many agreements for the supply of materials used in the manufacture of our products in order to hedge against shortages or potential spikes in material costs. We also contract with third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of some of our products. In the event we were to lose any significant suppliers and experience any difficulties in finding or transitioning to alternative suppliers, it could result in product shortages or product back orders, which could harm our business. There can be no assurance that suppliers will be able to provide us with the raw materials in the quantities and at the appropriate level of quality that we request or at a price that we are willing to pay. We are also subject to the delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials including weather, crop conditions, climate change, transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\nOccasionally, our suppliers have experienced production difficulties with respect to our products, including the delivery of materials or products that do not meet our quality control standards. These quality problems have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, stock outages or shortages of our products, and could harm our sales and create inventory write-offs for unusable product.\nGeopolitical issues and conflicts could adversely affect our business.\nBecause a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the United States, our business is subject to global political issues and conflicts. If these conflicts or issues escalate, it could harm our foreign operations. In addition, changes in and actions by governments in foreign markets could harm our business. For example, the Company has cautioned that sales in its NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe segment will undoubtedly continue to be affected by the political unrest in Ukraine and Russia, possible sanctions in Russia and the impact of currency devaluation.\nOur business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception.\nOur ability to attract and retain independent Distributors, as well as their ability to maintain or grow sales in the future, can be affected by either adverse publicity or negative public perception with regard to our industry, our competition, our direct selling model, the quality or efficacy of nutritional product supplements and ingredients, and our business generally. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that it would not have an adverse or material negative impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTaxation and transfer pricing affect our operations.\nAs a U.S. company doing business in many international markets, we are subject to foreign tax and intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between our parent Company and our subsidiaries. These pricing laws are designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income and expense are reported by our U.S. and foreign entities, and that they are taxed appropriately. Regulators in the United States and in foreign markets closely monitor our corporate structures, intercompany transactions, and how we effectuate intercompany fund transfers. If regulators challenge our corporate structures, transfer pricing methodologies or intercompany transfers, our operations may be harmed, and our effective tax rate may increase. We are eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the United States for certain foreign taxes actually paid abroad. In the event any audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us, we may not be able to offset the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of U.S. foreign tax credits. Because the laws and regulations governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment, we cannot be sure that we would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future. The various customs, exchange control and transfer pricing laws are continually changing, and are subject to the interpretation of governmental agencies.\nWe collect and remit value-added taxes and sales taxes in jurisdictions and states in which we have determined that nexus exists. Other states may claim, from time to time, that we have state-related activities constituting a sufficient nexus to require such collection.\nDespite our efforts to be aware of and to comply with such laws and changes to the interpretations thereof, there is a risk that we may not continue to operate in compliance with such laws. We may need to adjust our operating procedures in response to these interpretational changes, and such changes could have a material negative impact on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to intellectual property risks.\nMost of our products are not protected by patents. Restrictive regulations governing the precise labeling of ingredients and percentages for nutritional supplements, the large number of manufacturers that produce products with many active ingredients in common and the rapid change and frequent reformulation of products generally make patent protection impractical. As a result, we enter into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees in our research and development activities, our independent associates, suppliers, directors, officers and consultants to help protect our intellectual property, investment in research and development activities and trade secrets. We have also obtained trademarks for the Nature\u2019s Sunshine Products name and logo as well as the Synergy WorldWide name. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property and trademarks will be successful, nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us for infringement of intellectual property rights, which could result in our business being required to obtain licenses for such rights, to pay royalties or to terminate our manufacturing of infringing products, all of which could have a material negative impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nProduct liability claims could harm our business.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of our products results in alleged injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination and/or other causes. We have historically had a very limited number of product claims or\nreports from individuals who have asserted that they have suffered adverse consequences as a result of using our products. We have established a wholly-owned captive insurance company to provide us with product liability insurance coverage, and have accrued a reserve that we believe is sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable liabilities related to product liability claims based upon our history. There can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be sufficient, nor can there be any assurance that the ultimate outcome of any litigation for product liability will not have a material negative impact on our business prospects, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nInventory obsolescence due to finite shelf lives could adversely affect our business.\nIn order to provide a high level of product availability to our independent Distributors and customers, we maintain a considerable inventory of raw materials in the United States and of finished goods in most countries in which we sell our products. Our inventories of both raw materials and finished goods have finite shelf lives. If we overestimate the demand for our products, we could experience significant write-downs of our inventory due to obsolescence. Such write-downs could have a material negative impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSystem failures could harm our business.\nLike many companies, our business is highly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure (websites, accounting and manufacturing applications, and product and customer information databases) to manage effectively and efficiently our operations, including order entry, customer billing, accurately tracking purchases and volume incentives and managing accounting, finance and manufacturing operations. The occurrences of natural disasters, security breaches or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions in our day-to-day business that could adversely affect our business. We have a disaster recovery plan in place to mitigate such risk. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that a long-term failure or impairment of any of our information systems would not adversely affect our ability to conduct our day-to-day business.\nBeginning in 2013, we began to significantly reinvest in information technology systems. Included within this plan is an Oracle ERP implementation program to provide the Company with a single integrated software solution that will integrate the Company\u2019s business process on a worldwide basis. However, the unsuccessful implementation or failure of this ERP program could disrupt or adversely affect our business operations.\nThe Company could incur obligations relating to the activities of our independent Distributors and contracted third-parties.\nWe sell our products worldwide to a sales force of independent Distributors who use the products themselves or resell them to other independent Distributors or consumers. In addition, in certain foreign markets, we contract with third-parties to distribute our product and provide support services to our independent sales force of Managers and Distributors. Independent Distributors and contracted third-parties are not employees and operate their own business separate and apart from the Company, and we may not be able to control aspects of their activities that may impact our business. If local laws and regulations or the interpretation of locals laws and regulations change and require us to treat our independent Distributors as employees, or if our independent Distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, we may be held responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees, including employment related taxes and penalties. Our independent Distributors also operate in jurisdictions where local legislation and governmental agencies require us to collect and remit taxes such as sales tax or value-added taxes. In addition, there is the possibility that some jurisdictions could seek to hold the Company responsible for false product claims or the negligent actions of an independent Distributor. To date, the Company has had no such occurrences. If the Company were found to be responsible for any of these issues related to our independent Distributors, it could have a material negative impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf our independent Distributors fail to comply with labeling laws, then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed.\nAlthough the physical labeling of our products is not within the control of our independent Distributors, our independent Distributors must nevertheless advertise our products in compliance with the extensive regulations that exist in certain jurisdictions, such as the United States, which considers product advertising to be labeling for regulatory purposes. Our products are sold principally as dietary supplements and cosmetics and are subject to rigorous FDA and related legal regimens limiting the types of therapeutic claims that can be made for our products. The treatment or cure of disease, for example, is not a permitted claim for these products. While we train our independent Distributors and attempt to monitor our independent Distributors\u2019 marketing materials, we cannot ensure that all such materials comply with applicable regulations, including bans on therapeutic claims. If our independent Distributors fail to comply with these restrictions, then we and our independent Distributors could be subjected to claims, financial penalties, mandatory product recalls or relabeling requirements, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nAlthough we expect that our responsibility for the actions of our independent Distributors in such an instance would be dependent on a determination that we either controlled or condoned a noncompliant advertising practice, there can be no assurance that we could not be held vicariously liable for the actions of our independent Distributors.\nChanges in key management could materially adversely affect the Company.\nWe believe our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers, and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team. We have entered into employment agreements with each of our named executive officers, which we believe achieves two important goals crucial to our long-term financial success: the long-term retention of our senior executives and their commitment to attain our strategic objectives. However, we cannot guarantee the continued service of our key officers. The loss or limitation of any of our executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material negative impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We do not carry key man insurance on the lives of any of our executive officers.\nOur business is involved in an industry with intense competition.\nOur business operates in an industry with numerous manufacturers, distributors and retailers of nutritional products. The market for our products is intensely competitive. Many of our competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial resources, and have better name recognition than we do. We also rely on our independent Distributors to market and sell our products through direct selling techniques, as well as sponsoring other independent Distributors. Our ability to compete with other direct selling companies depends greatly on our ability to attract and retain our independent Distributors. In addition, we currently do not have significant patent or other proprietary protection, and our competitors may introduce products with the same or similar ingredients that we use in our products. As a result, we may have difficulty differentiating our products from our competitors\u2019 product and other competing products that enter the nutritional market. There can be no assurance that our future operations would not be harmed as a result of changing market conditions and future competition.\nOur share price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common shares is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in our quarterly operating results and the market price of our common stock may not remain at or exceed current levels. Factors other than our financial results that may affect our share price include, but are not limited to, market expectations of our performance, market perception or our industry, the activities of our independent Managers, Distributors and customers, the level of perceived growth in the industry in which we participate, general trends in the markets for our products, general economic, business and political conditions in the countries and regions in which we conduct our business, currency exchange issues in our foreign markets, changes in government regulation affecting our business, political issues and conflicts, many of which are not within our control.\nWe may experience Unintended negative effects from our independent Manager and Distributor promotions or compensation plans.\nThe payment of volume incentives to our independent Managers and Distributors is our most significant expense. These incentives include commissions, bonuses and certain awards and prizes based on promotions and product levels. From time to time, we adjust our compensation plan to better manage these incentives as a percentage of net sales. We closely monitor the amount of volume incentives that are paid as a percentage of net sales, and may periodically adjust our compensation plan to prevent volume incentives from having a significant adverse effect on our earnings. In addition to the compensation plan, we frequently design and implement economic and non-economic incentives and promotions to motivate and reward our independent Distributors. There can be no assurance that changes to the compensation plan, product pricing, or promotions and incentives will be successful in achieving target levels of volume incentives as a percentage of net sales. Furthermore, such programs, promotions or incentives could result in unintended or unforeseen negative economic and non-economic consequences to our business, such as higher than anticipated costs.\nOur manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks.\nWe manufacture approximately 80 percent of the products sold to our customers at our Spanish Fork, Utah location. As a result, we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facility in Spanish Fork and our distribution facilities throughout the country. Our manufacturing facilities and distribution facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to, among other things, earthquake, fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as occurrence of significant equipment failures. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it would be expected to disrupt our operations and could result in personal injury or property damage, damage relationships with our customers or result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems, as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts.\nIn addition, we contract with third-party manufacturers to produce some of our vitamins, mineral and other nutritional supplements, personal care products and certain other miscellaneous products in accordance with our specifications and standards. These contract manufacturers are subject to the same risks as our manufacturing facility as noted above. In addition, while we have\nimplemented stringent quality control procedures to verify that our contract manufacturers comply with our specifications and standards, we do not have full control over their manufacturing activities. Any difficulties, delays and defects in our products resulting from the activities of our contract manufacturers may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure of third party support could negatively impact our sales revenue and profitability.\nWe have contracted with third-parties in several of our key markets to distribute our product and provide support services to our independent sales force of Managers and Distributors. We rely on these third parties to perform various required administrative functions in support of our independent Managers and Distributors. Any failure of these third parties in this regard could result in the disruption of our business in these markets and adversely affect revenue and profitability.\nOur failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products or product enhancements could significantly harm our Distributor relationships and product sales and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to these changes, and we may not react in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes. Furthermore, the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions and enhancements. Our failure to accurately predict these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of our products, which in turn could harm our Distributor relationships and cause the loss of sales. If we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our customers in a timely manner, some of our products could be rendered obsolete, which could negatively impact our revenues, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to further penetrate existing markets and expand our business into New Markets, then the growth in sales of our products, along with our operating results, could be negatively impacted.\nThe success of our business is to a large extent contingent on our ability to further penetrate existing markets and to enter into New Markets. Our ability to further penetrate existing markets or to expand our business into additional countries, to the extent we believe that we have identified attractive geographic expansion opportunities in the future, is subject to numerous factors, many of which are out of our control.\nIn addition, government regulations in both our domestic and international markets can delay or prevent the introduction, or require the reformulation or withdrawal, of some of our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, our ability to increase market penetration in certain countries may be limited by the finite number of persons in a given country inclined to pursue a direct selling business opportunity or consumers willing to purchase our products. Moreover, our growth will depend upon improved training and other activities that enhance Distributor retention in our markets. While we have recently experienced significant growth in certain of our markets, we cannot make assurances that such growth levels will continue in the immediate or long term future. Furthermore, our efforts to support growth in such international markets could be hampered to the extent that our infrastructure in such markets is deficient when compared to our more developed markets, such as the U.S. Therefore, we cannot make assurances that our general efforts to increase our market penetration and Distributor retention in existing markets will be successful. If we are unable to continue to expand into New Markets or further penetrate existing markets, our operating results could suffer.\nOur expansion in China is subject to risks associated with operating a joint venture, as well as general, industry-specific, economic, political and legal risks in China and requires that we utilize a different business model from that which we use elsewhere in the world.\nOur expansion of operations into China is subject to risks and uncertainties related to operating a joint venture, as well as general economic, political and legal developments in China, among other things. The Chinese government exercises significant control over all aspects of the Chinese economy and the direct selling industry in particular. Accordingly, any adverse change in the Chinese economy, the Chinese legal system or Chinese governmental, economic or other policies could have a material adverse effect on our business in China and our prospects generally.\nOn August 25, 2014, Nature\u2019s Sunshine and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (\u201cFosun Pharma\u201d), closed a transaction pursuant to which, the parties entered into a joint venture in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d) 80 percent is owned by Nature\u2019s Sunshine and 20 percent is owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fosun Pharma. Smooth operation of the joint venture depends on good relations between the Company and Fosun Pharma, active synergies between the two companies and positive legal and regulatory recognition of the joint venture. Any disruption in relations, inability to work efficiently or disadvantageous treatment of the joint venture by the Chinese or other authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business in China.\nIn 2005, China published regulations governing direct selling and prohibiting pyramid promotional schemes, and a number of administrative methods and proclamations were issued in 2005 and in 2006. These regulations require us to use a business model\ndifferent from that which we offer in other markets. To allow us to operate under these regulations, we are creating a model specifically for China.\nThe direct selling regulations require us to apply for various approvals to conduct a direct selling enterprise in China. The process for obtaining the necessary licenses to conduct a direct selling business is protracted and cumbersome and involves multiple layers of Chinese governmental authorities and numerous governmental employees at each layer. While direct selling licenses are centrally issued, such licenses are generally valid only in the jurisdictions within which related approvals have been obtained. Such approvals are generally awarded on local and provincial bases, and the approval process requires involvement with multiple ministries at each level. Our participation and conduct during the approval process is guided not only by distinct Chinese practices and customs, but is also subject to applicable laws of China and the other jurisdictions in which we operate our business, including the U.S., as well as our internal code of ethics. There is always a risk that in attempting to comply with local customs and practices in China during the application process or otherwise, we will fail to comply with requirements applicable to us in China itself or in other jurisdictions, and any such failure to comply with applicable requirements could prevent us from obtaining the direct selling licenses or related local or provincial approvals. Furthermore, we rely on certain key management, regulatory and legal personnel in China to assist us during the approval process, and the loss of any such key personnel could delay or hinder our ability to obtain licenses or related approvals. For all of the above reasons, there can be no assurance that we will obtain direct-selling licenses, or obtain related approvals to expand into any or all of the localities or provinces in China that are important to our business. Our inability to obtain, retain, or renew any or all of the licenses or related approvals that are required for us to operate in China could negatively impact our business.\nAdditionally, although certain regulations have been published with respect to obtaining and operating under such approvals and otherwise conducting business in China, other regulations are pending and there continues to be uncertainty regarding the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese regulations. The regulatory environment in China is evolving, and officials in the Chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations. We cannot be certain that our business model will continue to be deemed by national or local Chinese regulatory authorities to be compliant with any such regulations. The Chinese government rigorously monitors the direct selling market in China, and in the past has taken serious action against companies that the government believed were engaging in activities they regarded to be in violation of applicable law, including shutting down their businesses and imposing substantial fines. As a result, there can be no guarantee that the Chinese government\u2019s current or future interpretation and application of the existing and new regulations will not negatively impact our business in China, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties against us.\nChinese regulations prevent persons who are not Chinese nationals from engaging in direct selling in China. We cannot guarantee that any of our Members living outside of China or any of our sales representatives or independent service providers in China have not engaged or will not engage in activities that violate our policies in this market, or that violate Chinese law or other applicable law, and therefore result in regulatory action and adverse publicity.\nIf we are not able to register products for sale in Mainland China, our business could be harmed.\nOur registration of our products for sale in China is extremely time intensive. The requirements for obtaining product registrations and/or licenses involve extended periods of time that may delay us from offering products for sale or prevent us from launching new product initiatives in China on the same timelines as other markets around the world. For example, products marketed in China as \u201chealth foods\u201d or for which certain claims are used are subject to \u201cblue cap\u201d or \u201cblue hat\u201d registrations, which involve extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by governmental authorities. This registration process can take anywhere from 18 months to 3 years, but may be substantially longer. We currently intend to market both \u201chealth foods\u201d and \u201cgeneral foods\u201d in China. There is risk associated with the common practice in China of marketing a product as a \u201cgeneral food\u201d while seeking \u201chealth food\u201d classification. If government officials feel the categorization of our products is inconsistent with product claims, ingredients or function, this could end or limit our ability to market such products in China.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage rapid growth in China, our operations could be harmed.\nIf our operations in China are successful, we may experience rapid growth in China, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully manage rapid expansion of manufacturing operations and a rapidly growing and dynamic sales force. If we are unable to effectively manage such growth and expansion of our retail stores and manufacturing operations, our government relations may be compromised and our operations in China may be harmed.", "PERMNO": 56945, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NATR"}
