RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors in this section describe the major risks to our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and should be considered carefully. In addition, these factors constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements (as defined in such act) made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any statements that are not historical facts and that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, targets, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as \u201cwill likely result,\u201d \u201care expected to,\u201d \u201cwill continue,\u201d \u201cis anticipated,\u201d \u201cestimated,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves\u201d and \u201cprojects\u201d) may be forward-looking and may involve estimates and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Investors should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.\nFurther, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each such factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n- 13 -\nThere is no assurance when or if the Revlon Merger will be completed. Failure to complete the Revlon Merger could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nCompletion of the Revlon Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived by December 16, 2016 (which we refer to as the \u201cMerger Deadline\u201d).We and Revlon may not be able to satisfy the closing conditions and closing conditions beyond our or their control may not be satisfied or waived and the Revlon Merger may not be consummated by reason of the failure to so satisfy such conditions. Any delay in completing the Revlon Merger could result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other effects to us associated with uncertainty about the Revlon Merger, including a decline in the price of our common stock.\nIf the Revlon Merger is not completed by the Merger Deadline (as such deadline may be extended by agreement of the parties to the Merger Agreement), the parties to the Merger Agreement may not be obligated to complete the Revlon Merger. If the Revlon Merger is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected, and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay to Revlon a $14 million termination fee in connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay certain other costs relating to the Revlon Merger, whether or not the Revlon Merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees; and\n\u2022\nin addition to the litigation regarding the Revlon Merger discussed in Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d we may be subject to further litigation related to any failure to complete the Revlon Merger.\nIf the Revlon Merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, as well as the price of our common stock, which may cause the value of shareholders\u2019 investment to decline. We cannot provide any assurance that the Revlon Merger will be completed or that there will not be a delay in the completion of the Revlon Merger.\nWe could be subject to business disruptions and uncertainties during the pendency of the Revlon Merger that could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe pendency of the Revlon Merger could cause disruptions to our current plans and operations and create uncertainty regarding our business. For example, the Merger Agreement restricts our ability to take certain specified actions, such as acquire or dispose of certain assets, without the prior written consent of Revlon. Uncertainty about the effect of the Revlon Merger on employees, customers, distributors, suppliers and business partners may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Revlon Merger is consummated and could cause customers, suppliers and others who deal with us to change their existing business relationships with us. Key employees may become distracted from day-to-day operations because matters related to the Revlon Merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources, or they may depart because of issues related to the uncertainty related to the Revlon Merger. Such disruptions and uncertainties may have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur level of debt and debt service obligations and our obligations with respect to our redeemable preferred stock, the restrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility and second lien credit agreement and our indenture for our 7 3/8% senior notes, and the terms of our outstanding redeemable preferred stock, may reduce our operating and financial flexibility, including our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and future growth, and could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.\nAt June 30, 2016, we had total debt of approximately $422 million which includes (i) $350 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 7 3/8% senior notes (plus approximately $5 million in unamortized premium on our 7 3/8% senior notes), (ii) $42 million outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility, and (iii) $25 million under our second lien credit agreement. We also have $50 million of issued and outstanding redeemable preferred stock. The 7 3/8% senior notes, the revolving bank credit facility, the second lien agreement, and the terms and conditions associated with our redeemable preferred stock (and the shareholders agreement related thereto) have requirements that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. Our indebtedness and obligations under our redeemable preferred stock could adversely impact our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and restricting our ability to consummate acquisitions or fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements.\nSpecifically, our revolving credit facility, second lien credit agreement, our indenture for our 7 3/8% senior notes and the terms and conditions associated with our redeemable preferred stock (and the shareholders agreement related thereto) limit or otherwise affect our ability to, among other things:\n- 14 -\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreate or permit certain liens, other than customary and ordinary liens;\n\u2022\nsell assets other than in the ordinary course of our business;\n\u2022\ninvest in other entities or businesses; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities. Our revolving credit facility also requires us to maintain specified amounts of borrowing capacity and borrowing availability or maintain a debt service coverage ratio. Our ability to meet these conditions and our ability to service our debt and redeemable preferred stock obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which can be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. If our actual results deviate significantly from our projections, we may not be able to service our debt or redeemable preferred stock or remain in compliance with the conditions contained in our revolving credit facility, and we would not be allowed to borrow under the revolving credit facility. If we were not able to borrow under our revolving credit facility, we would be required to develop an alternative source of liquidity. We cannot assure you that we could obtain replacement financing on favorable terms or at all.\nA default under our revolving credit facility or second lien credit agreement could also result in a default under our indenture for our 7 3/8% senior notes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our indenture, all amounts outstanding under our other indebtedness may be declared to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay amounts due on our revolving credit facility or second lien credit agreement, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt.\nWe may be adversely affected by factors affecting our customers\u2019 businesses.\nFactors that adversely impact our customers\u2019 businesses may also have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. These factors may include:\n\u2022\nany reduction in consumer traffic and demand at our customers as a result of economic downturns like domestic and international recessions, terrorist attacks or civil unrest, or changes in consumer preferences;\n\u2022\nany credit risks associated with the financial condition of our customers;\n\u2022\nthe effect of consolidation or weakness in the retail industry or at certain retail customers, including the closure of customer doors and the resulting uncertainty; and\n\u2022\ninventory reduction initiatives and other factors affecting customer buying patterns, including any reduction in retail space committed to fragrances, skin care products, and cosmetics and retailer practices used to control inventory shrinkage.\nWe do not have contracts with customers or with suppliers of our distributed brands, so if we cannot maintain and develop relationships with such customers and suppliers our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not have long-term or exclusive contracts with any of our customers and generally do not have long-term or exclusive contracts with our suppliers of distributed brands. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 39% of our net sales in the year ended June 30, 2016. Our only customer who accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in the year ended June 30, 2016 was Walmart (including Sam\u2019s Club), which accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 20% of our North America segment net sales. In addition, our suppliers of distributed brands, which represented approximately 13% of our net sales for fiscal 2016, generally can, at any time, elect to supply products to our customers directly or through another distributor. Our suppliers of distributed brands may also choose to alter the selection or volume of their products distributed by us. The loss of any of our key suppliers or customers, or a change in our relationship with any one of them, including reduced sales to key customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n- 15 -\nWe depend on various brand licenses for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of one or more licenses or agreements could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur rights to market and sell certain of our prestige fragrance brands are derived from licenses from unaffiliated third parties and our business is dependent upon the continuation and renewal of such licenses on terms favorable to us. Each license is for a specific term and may have optional renewal terms. In addition, such licenses may be subject to us making required minimum royalty payments, minimum advertising and promotional expenditures and meeting minimum sales requirements. Just as the loss of a license or other significant agreement may have a material adverse effect on us, a renewal on less favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our 2014 Performance Improvement Plan, 2016 Business Transformation Program, or other restructuring or cost saving initiatives could have a material adverse effect on us.\nDuring fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, we undertook broad restructuring and cost savings programs that are intended to reduce the size and cost of our overhead structure and exit low-return businesses, customers and brands to improve gross margins and profitability in the long term. The 2014 Performance Improvement Plan included the exiting of certain unprofitable retail doors and fragrance license agreements, changes in customer, distribution and supply chain relationships, the discontinuation of certain products, headcount reductions, and the closing of our affiliate in Puerto Rico. The 2016 Business Transformation Program is intended to further align our organizational structure and distribution arrangements with the current needs and demands of our business in order to improve our go-to-market capability and execution and to streamline our organization. Although we believe that actions taken under the 2014 Performance Improvement Plan and 2016 Business Transformation Program will result in annual cost savings of approximately $51 million, and thus facilitate long-term growth in profitability, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of these initiatives. The failure to realize such anticipated benefits, which could result from our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe sell our products in approximately 120 countries around the world. During each of the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we derived approximately 43% of our net sales from our international operations. We conduct our international operations in a variety of different countries and derive our sales in various currencies including the Euro, British pound, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, as well as the U.S. dollar. Most of our skin care and cosmetic products are produced in third-party manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. Our operations may be subject to volatility because of currency changes, inflation and changes in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate. With respect to international operations, our sales, cost of goods sold and expenses are typically denominated in a combination of local currency and the U.S. dollar. Our results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in currency rates can affect our reported sales, margins, operating costs and the anticipated settlement of our foreign denominated receivables and payables. A weakening of the foreign currencies in which we generate sales relative to the currencies in which our costs are denominated, which is primarily the U.S. dollar, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Our competitors may or may not be subject to the same fluctuations in currency rates, and our competitive position could be affected by these changes.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers and component suppliers for substantially all of our owned and licensed products.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We use third-party manufacturers and component suppliers to source and manufacture substantially all of our owned and licensed products. Over the past several years, we have reduced the number of third-party manufacturers and component and materials suppliers that we use, and have implemented a \u201cturnkey\u201d manufacturing process for substantially all of our products in which we now rely on our third-party manufacturers for certain supply chain functions that we previously handled ourselves, such as component and raw materials planning, purchasing and warehousing. Our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we experience any supply chain disruptions caused by this \u201cturnkey\u201d manufacturing process or other supply chain projects, or if our manufacturers or raw material suppliers were to experience problems with product quality, credit or liquidity issues, or disruptions or delays in the manufacturing process or delivery of the finished products or the raw materials or components used to make such products.\nThe loss of or disruption in our distribution facilities may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently have one distribution facility in the United States and use a third-party fulfillment center in the Netherlands primarily for European distribution. These facilities house a large portion of our inventory. Although we insure our inventory, any loss, damage or disruption of these facilities, or loss or damage of the inventory stored in them, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n- 16 -\nOur business is subject to regulation in the United States and internationally.\nThe manufacturing, distribution, formulation, packaging and advertising of our products and those we distribute for others are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign governmental regulations. The number of laws and regulations that are being enacted or proposed by state, federal and international governments and governmental authorities are increasing. Compliance with these regulations is difficult and expensive and may require reformulation, repackaging, relabeling or discontinuation of certain of our products. If we fail to adhere, or are alleged to have failed to adhere, to any applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, or if such laws or regulations negatively affect sales of our products, our business, prospects, results of operation, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected by changes in applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, including those relating to products or ingredients, packaging, product liability, trade rules and customs regulations, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, consumer laws, privacy laws, anti-corruption laws, as well as accounting standards and taxation requirements (including tax-rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations).\nAdverse U.S. or international economic conditions could negatively impact our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe believe that consumer spending on beauty products is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Adverse U.S. or international economic conditions, such as the current economic environment in Europe and the economic uncertainty resulting from the proposed withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union., or periods of inflation or high energy prices can contribute to higher unemployment levels, decreased consumer spending, reduced credit availability and declining consumer confidence and demand, each of which poses risks to our business. A decrease in consumer spending and/or in retailer and consumer confidence and demand for our products could significantly negatively impact our net sales and profitability, including our operating margins and return on invested capital. Such economic conditions could cause some of our customers or suppliers to experience cash flow and/or credit problems and impair their financial condition, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect product orders, payment patterns and default rates and increase our bad debt expense. Adverse economic conditions could also adversely affect our access to the capital necessary for our business and our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenant in our revolving credit facility that applies only in the event that we do not have the requisite average borrowing base capacity and borrowing availability, as set forth in our credit facility. If adverse U.S. or international economic conditions persist or deteriorate further, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nWe may be adversely affected by domestic and international events that impact consumer confidence and demand, financial markets and business operations.\nSudden disruptions in business conditions due to events such as terrorist attacks, diseases, severe weather or natural disasters may have a short-term, or sometimes long-term, adverse impact on consumer confidence and spending, financial markets and our business operations, which could negatively impact our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, any reductions in travel or increases in restrictions on travelers\u2019 ability to transport our products on airplanes due to general economic downturns, diseases, increased security levels, acts of war or terrorism could result in a material decline in the net sales and profitability of our travel retail business.\nThe beauty industry is highly competitive and if we cannot effectively compete, our business and results of operations will suffer.\nThe beauty industry is highly competitive and can change rapidly due to consumer preferences and industry trends. Competition in the beauty industry is based on brand strength, pricing and assortment of products, in-store presence and visibility, innovation, perceived value, product availability and order fulfillment, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and mobile commerce initiatives and other activities. It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors\u2019 actions in these areas. The trend toward consolidation in the retail trade has also resulted in risks related to increased customer concentration, including becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers, including large-format retailers, who have increased their bargaining strength. We compete primarily with global prestige beauty companies and multinational consumer product companies, some of whom have greater resources than we have and brands with greater name recognition and consumer loyalty than our brands. In addition, the fragrances segment in the U.S. is being influenced by the high volume of new product introductions by diverse companies across several different distribution channels, including private label brands and lower cost brands that have increased pricing pressure. Our success depends on our products\u2019 appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change, and on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely and cost-effective manner to market trends through product innovations, product line extensions and marketing and promotional activities. As product life cycles shorten, we must continually work to develop, produce, and market new products and maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands. Net revenues and margins on beauty products tend to decline as they advance in their life cycles, so our net revenues and margins could suffer if we do not successfully and continuously develop new products. This issue is further compounded by the rapidly increasing use and proliferation of social and digital media by consumers, and the speed with which information and opinions are shared. Constant product innovation also can place a strain on our financial and personnel resources. We may incur expenses in connection with product innovation and development, marketing and advertising that are not subsequently supported by a sufficient level of sales, which could negatively affect our results of operations. These competitive factors, as well as new product risks, could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n- 17 -\nThe success of our global business strategy depends upon our ability to increase sales of the Elizabeth Arden brand and our prestige fragrance portfolio, as well as our ability to acquire or license additional brands or secure additional distribution arrangements and obtain the required financing for these agreements and arrangements.\nOur business strategy contemplates the continued growth of our portfolio of owned, licensed and distributed brands, including expanding our geographic presence to take advantage of opportunities in developed and emerging markets. Efforts to increase sales of the Elizabeth Arden brand and our prestige fragrance portfolio and expand our geographic market presence, such as our global repositioning of the Elizabeth Arden brand, depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\ndevelop our brand portfolio through branding, innovation and execution;\n\u2022\nidentify and develop new and existing brands with the potential to become successful global brands;\n\u2022\ninnovate and develop new products that are appealing to the consumer;\n\u2022\nacquire or license additional brands or secure additional distribution arrangements and obtain the required financing for these agreements and arrangements;\n\u2022\nexpand our geographic presence to take advantage of opportunities in developed and emerging markets;\n\u2022\ncontinue to expand our distribution channels within existing geographies to increase market presence, brand recognition and sales;\n\u2022\nexpand our market presence through alternative distribution channels;\n\u2022\nexpand margins through sales growth, the development of higher margin products, and overhead and supply chain integration and efficiency initiatives;\n\u2022\neffectively manage capital investments and working capital to improve the generation of cash flow; and\n\u2022\nexecute any acquisitions quickly and efficiently and integrate businesses successfully.\nThere can be no assurance that we can successfully achieve any or all of the above objectives in the manner or time period that we expect. Further, achieving these objectives will require investments, which may result in material short-term costs without generating any current net revenues and, we may not ultimately achieve our net sales or earnings estimates associated with such efforts. Our future expansion through acquisitions, new product licenses or new product distribution arrangements, if any, will depend upon our ability to identify suitable brands to acquire, license or distribute and our ability to obtain the required financing for these acquisitions, licenses or distribution arrangements or to launch or support the brands associated with these agreements or arrangements, and thus depends on the capital resources and working capital available to us. We may not be able to identify, negotiate, finance or consummate such acquisitions, licenses or arrangements, or the associated working capital requirements, on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could hinder our ability to increase revenues and build our business. In addition, we may decide to divest or discontinue certain brands or streamline operations and incur other costs or special charges in doing so. We cannot give any assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits we expect our business strategy will achieve. The failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the demand for heritage, celebrity and designer fragrance products.\nWe have rights to manufacture, market and distribute a number of heritage, celebrity and designer fragrance products, including those of Juicy Couture, John Varvatos, Elizabeth Taylor, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, Ed Hardy, Lucky, Halston, Geoffrey Beene and Wildfox Couture. In fiscal 2016, we derived approximately 46% of our net sales from heritage, celebrity and designer fragrance brands, and celebrity fragrances accounted for approximately 4% of our net sales. The demand for these products is, to some extent, dependent on the appeal to consumers of the particular celebrity or designer and the celebrity\u2019s or designer\u2019s reputation. To the extent that the celebrity/designer fragrance category or a particular celebrity or designer ceases to be appealing to consumers or a celebrity\u2019s or designer\u2019s reputation is adversely affected, sales of the related products and the value of the brands can decrease materially. In addition, under certain circumstances, lower net sales may shorten the duration of the applicable license agreement.\n- 18 -\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to successfully manage our inventory.\nThe competitive nature of the beauty industry and rapidly changing consumer preferences require constant product innovation and have led to the shortening of product life cycles. As a result, we monitor our inventories based on forecasted demand, the estimated market value and shelf life of our inventory and our historic experience. If we misjudge consumer preferences or demands or future sales do not reach forecasted levels, however, we could have excess inventory that we may need to hold for a long period of time, write down, sell at prices lower than expected or discard. If we are not successful in managing our inventory, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to successfully and cost-effectively integrate acquired businesses or new brands.\nAcquisitions entail numerous integration risks and impose costs on us that could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating acquired operations, products or brands, including disruptions to our operations or the unavailability of key employees from acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day management of our core business;\n\u2022\nan inability to achieve net sales or earnings assumptions associated with such acquired businesses or brands;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n\u2022\nincurrence or assumption of additional debt and liabilities, as well as the potential for increased claims and litigation; and\n\u2022\nincurrence of significant amortization expenses related to intangible assets and the potential impairment of acquired assets\nOur failure to achieve intended benefits from any future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights or if our licensors are unable to successfully protect their intellectual property rights.\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with the trademarks and patents that we own or license. We own, or have licenses or other rights to use, the material trademarks and patents used in connection with the ingredients, packaging, marketing and distribution of our major owned and licensed products both in the U.S. and in certain other countries where such products are principally sold.\nAlthough most of our brand names are registered in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. The costs required to protect our trademarks and patents may be substantial. We also cannot assure that the owners of the trademarks that we license can or will successfully maintain their intellectual property rights.\nIf other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights that we license, the value of our brands in the marketplace may be diluted. In addition, any infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a commitment of our time and resources to protect these rights through litigation or otherwise. One or more adverse judgments with respect to these intellectual property rights could negatively impact our ability to compete and could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n- 19 -\nOur success depends on our ability to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the trademarks, patents, copyrights and proprietary rights of other parties.\nOur commercial success depends at least in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the trademarks, patents, copyrights and other proprietary rights of others. We cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate such rights. Many companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage. For these and other reasons, third parties may allege that our products, services or activities infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademark, patent, copyright or other proprietary rights. Defending against allegations and litigation could be expensive, take significant time, divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and delay getting our products to market. In addition, if we are found to be infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third party trademark, patent, copyright or other proprietary rights, we may need to obtain a license, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or redesign or rebrand our products, which may not be possible, and even if possible, may be costly. We may also be required to pay substantial damages or be subject to a court order prohibiting us and our customers from selling certain products or engaging in certain activities. Our inability to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the trademarks, patents, copyrights and proprietary rights of others could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nIf our intangible assets, such as trademarks, patents, exclusive brand licenses and goodwill, become impaired, we may be required to record a significant non-cash charge to earnings which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nExclusive brand licenses, trademarks and intangibles comprise a material portion of our total consolidated assets. Acquisitions of brands typically result in an increase in other intangibles on our balance sheet. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets, including our trademarks, patents, licenses and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be fully recoverable. The carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows, including those associated with the specific brands to which intangibles relate, or slower growth rates in our industry.\nEstimates of future cash flows are based on a long-term financial outlook of our operations and the specific brands to which the intangible assets relate. However, actual performance in the near-term or long-term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact future estimates and the recorded value of the intangibles. For example, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, net sales of Justin Bieber and Nicki Minaj fragrances fell significantly below expectations, and we reviewed these license agreements for potential impairment. Given the significant decline in net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and the expectation for a continued decline of sales in future periods, we determined that these intangible assets were fully impaired and recorded a total impairment charge of approximately $39.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 to write off the carrying values of both the Justin Bieber and Nicki Minaj licenses.\nAccordingly, a significant sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows, or slower growth rates in our industry may result in impairment of certain of our intangible assets, including goodwill, and a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which an impairment is determined to exist. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment charge, and any such impairment charge could materially reduce our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations.\nWe operate on a global basis, with sales in approximately 120 countries. Approximately 43% of our fiscal 2016 net sales were generated outside of the United States. Our international operations could be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\nimport and export license requirements;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs and taxes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or our unfamiliarity with, foreign laws and regulations, including those related to product registration, ingredients, packaging and labeling, including changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks or other civil unrest; and\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable social, political, legal, economic and other conditions.\n- 20 -\nA downgrade in our credit ratings may adversely affect our access to financing and our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements.\nNationally recognized credit rating organizations have issued credit ratings relating to our long-term debt. Prior to the announcement of the pending Revlon Merger, our long-term credit ratings were Caa2 (Negative Outlook) with Moody\u2019s and CCC (Negative Outlook) with S&P, each of which is below investment grade. Future rating agency reviews could result in a change in outlook or further downgrade. A negative change in outlook or downgrade of our credit ratings, and/or the circumstances giving rise to such actions, could limit our access to financing, reduce our flexibility with respect to working capital needs, increase the cost of new financing, result in less favorable covenants and financial terms for our financing and adversely affect the market price of some or all of our outstanding debt securities.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flows.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses and tax credits) and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation or tax authority audit process. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income of the appropriate character in the relevant jurisdiction. Commencing in fiscal 2014, we have recorded valuation allowances against our U.S. deferred tax assets as non-cash charges to income tax expense. Additionally, commencing in fiscal 2015, for certain of our foreign operations, we recorded valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets as non-cash charges to income tax expense. The valuation allowances for our net deferred tax assets have resulted in our inability to record tax benefits on future losses in these jurisdictions unless sufficient future taxable income is generated in such jurisdictions to support the realization of the deferred tax assets. Although we may be able to utilize some of these deferred tax assets in the future if we have income of the appropriate character prior to their expiration, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.\nFrom time to time, tax proposals are introduced or considered by the United States Congress or the legislative bodies in foreign jurisdictions that could also affect our tax rate, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, or our other tax liabilities. Our tax liabilities are also affected by the amounts we charge for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items in intercompany transactions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions such as the current Internal Revenue Service examination of our U.S. federal tax returns for the years ended June 30, 2010, 2011 and 2012. In connection with these audits, tax authorities may disagree with certain tax positions taken on our tax returns, including without limitation cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, and assess additional taxes. Although we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, such provisions may not be adequate. As a result, the ultimate resolution of these tax audits, changes in tax laws or tax rates, and the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets could materially affect our tax provision, net income and cash flows in future periods.\nOur quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors, and we may not have sufficient liquidity to meet our seasonal working capital requirements.\nWe generate a significant portion of our net income in the first half of our fiscal year as a result of higher sales in anticipation of the holiday season. Similarly, our working capital needs are greater during the first half of the fiscal year. We may experience variability in net sales and net income on a quarterly basis as a result of a variety of factors, including new product innovations and launches, the size and timing of customer orders and additions or losses of brand distribution rights. If we were to experience a significant shortfall in sales or internally generated funds, we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products. If our products are found or alleged to be defective or unsafe, or if they fail to meet customer or consumer standards, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur success depends upon the retention and availability of key personnel and the succession of senior management.\nOur success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key personnel. Our future operations could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior executives and other key personnel. In addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our chief executive officer, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be materially adversely affected. See also the risk factor above entitled, \u201cWe will be subject to business uncertainties during the pendency of the Revlon Merger that could materially and adversely affect our business.\u201d\n- 21 -\nOur global information systems are subject to outages, hacking and other risks and the failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have information systems that support our business processes, including supply chain, marketing, sales, order processing, distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world. In addition, all of our global information systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe weather, power loss, telecommunications failures, security breaches and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, \u201chacking\u201d and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. Our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected by the occurrence of these or other events that could disrupt or damage our information systems or any failure to properly maintain or upgrade our information systems.\nIn addition, as part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information with respect to customers and employees, and the success of our e-commerce operations depends on the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to properly maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 personal information could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and other competitive disadvantages, and could accordingly have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe outsource certain functions, making us dependent on the entities and facilities performing those functions.\nWe are continually looking for opportunities to secure essential business services in a more cost-effective manner, without impacting the quality of the service rendered. In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers. These include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations, certain human resource functions such as payroll processing and employee benefit plan administration, and our international logistics management. We believe that we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity, and we use service level agreements and operating metrics to monitor and assess performance. The failure of one or more entities to properly provide the expected services without disruption, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, substantially all of our data center operations are located in a facility in Raleigh, North Carolina, and any loss of or damage to the facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, prospects, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe trading price of our equity and debt securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance, as well as other factors.\nOur business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in our best interests and those of our shareholders. At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections. Accordingly, from time to time we may provide guidance as to a number of assumptions, including our expectations with respect to net sales and earnings per share for future periods. We assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements.\nIn all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our net sales and/or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring, cost-savings or other initiatives, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect. Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press releases and in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q). These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.\n- 22 -\nOutside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period. Outside analysts, however, do not have access to any more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance. Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations. If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected. Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. The market price of our common stock could also fluctuate significantly in response to various other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nvolatility in the financial markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements or significant developments with respect to beauty products or the beauty industry in general;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental policies and regulations;\n\u2022\nfinancial analyst and rating agency actions; and\n\u2022\nrumors, speculation or third party statements about us, including any potential strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value or maximize the value of our brand portfolio.\nJoint ventures or strategic alliances in geographic markets in which we have limited or no prior experience may expose us to additional risks.\nWe review, and from time to time may establish, joint ventures and strategic alliances that we believe would complement our current product offerings, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities. These business relationships may require us to rely on the local expertise of our partners with respect to market development, sales, local regulatory compliance and other matters. Further, there may be challenges with ensuring that such joint ventures and strategic alliances implement the appropriate internal controls to ensure compliance with the various laws and regulations applicable to us as a U.S. public company. Accordingly, in addition to commercial and operational risk, these joint ventures and strategic alliances may entail risks such as reputational risk and regulatory compliance risk. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable alliance or joint venture candidates, that we will be able to consummate any such alliances or joint ventures on favorable terms, or that we will realize the anticipated benefits of entering into any such alliances or joint ventures.\n- 23 -", "PERMNO": 82699, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "RDEN"}
