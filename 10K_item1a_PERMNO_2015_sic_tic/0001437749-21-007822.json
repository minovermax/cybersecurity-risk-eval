{"cik": "719402", "company": "FIRST NATIONAL CORP /VA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s securities involves risks. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, investors in the Company\u2019s securities should carefully consider the factors discussed below. These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from its historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report, in which case the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities could decline.\nRisks Related To The Company\u2019s Business\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread may adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and operations; the extent of such impacts are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nGlobal health and economic concerns relating to the COVID-19 outbreak and government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have had a material adverse impact on the macroeconomic environment, and the outbreak has significantly increased economic uncertainty. The pandemic has resulted in federal, state and local authorities, including those who govern the markets in which we operate, implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus. These measures, including shelter in place orders and business limitations and shutdowns, have significantly contributed to rising unemployment and negatively impacted consumer and business spending.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has adversely impacted and is likely to continue to adversely impact the Company's workforce and operations and the operations of its customers and business partners. In particular, the Company may experience adverse effects due to a number of operational factors impacting it or its customers or business partners, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 credit losses resulting from financial stress experienced by the Company's borrowers, especially those operating in industries most hard hit by government measures to contain the spread of the virus;\n\u2022 operational failures, disruptions or inefficiencies due to changes in the Company's normal business practices necessitated by its internal measures to protect its employees and government-mandated measures intended to slow the spread of the virus;\n\u2022 possible business disruptions experienced by the Company's vendors and business partners in carrying out work that supports its operations;\n\u2022 decreased demand for the Company's products and services due to economic uncertainty, volatile market conditions and temporary business closures;\n\u2022 any financial liability, credit losses, litigation costs or reputational damage resulting from the Company's origination of PPP loans; and\n\u2022 heightened levels of cyber and payment fraud, as cyber criminals try to take advantage of the disruption and increased online activity brought about by the pandemic.\nThe extent to which the pandemic impacts the Company's business, liquidity, financial condition and operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, its duration and severity, the actions to contain it or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. In addition, the rapidly changing and unprecedented nature of COVID-19 heightens the inherent uncertainty of forecasting future economic conditions and their impact on the Company's loan portfolio, thereby increasing the risk that the assumptions, judgments and estimates used to determine the allowance for loan losses and other estimates are incorrect. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Bank modified certain loan agreements to provide payment relief to its customers experiencing business interruptions from the pandemic by providing interest only payments for periods ranging between 6 and 24 months. The extent of asset quality deterioration that could result from the modified loans may be impacted by the continuation of customers\u2019 business interruptions beyond the modification periods. As a result of these and other conditions, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change, and the Company cannot predict the full extent of the impacts on its business, its operations or the global economy as a whole.\nDependence on uncontrollable economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLike all financial institutions, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn. Our business is concentrated in the northern Shenandoah Valley and the central regions of Virginia. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be affected by changes in the economies of these regions. Adverse changes in economic conditions in our market areas would likely impair the ability to collect loans, increase problem assets and foreclosures, decrease demand for banking products and services, deteriorate the value of collateral for loans, and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a result, a deterioration in economic conditions may have a negative effect on our financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe inability of the Company to successfully manage its growth or implement its growth strategy may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial conditions.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy if it is unable to expand market share in existing locations, identify attractive markets, locations, or opportunities to expand in the future. In addition, the ability to manage growth successfully depends on whether the Company can maintain adequate capital levels, maintain cost controls, effectively manage asset quality, and successfully integrate any expanded business divisions or acquired businesses into the organization.\nAs the Company continues to implement its growth strategy by opening new branches or acquiring branches or banks, it expects to incur increased personnel, occupancy, and other operating expenses. In the case of new branches, the Company must absorb those higher expenses while it begins to generate new deposits. In the case of acquired branches, the Company must absorb higher expenses while it begins deploying the newly assumed deposit liabilities. With either new branches opened or branches acquired, there would be a time lag involved in deploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets. Thus, the Company\u2019s plans to expand could depress earnings in the short run, even if it efficiently executes a branching strategy leading to long-term financial benefits.\nDifficulties in combining the operations of new or acquired bank branches or entities with the Company\u2019s own operations may prevent the Company from achieving the expected benefits from acquisitions.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve fully the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies expected in opening a new branch or through an acquisition. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of a new or acquired entity or acquired branches. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its potential new branch locations or acquisition targets operate may be highly competitive. The Company may lose customers or the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition; the Company may lose key personnel, either from the acquired entity or from itself; and the Company may not be able to control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from a new branch location or acquisition in a manner that improves its overall operating efficiencies. These factors could contribute to the Company\u2019s not achieving the expected benefits from its new branch locations or acquisitions within desired time frames, if at all. Future business acquisitions could be material to the Company and it may issue additional shares of common stock to support those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interests. Acquisitions could also require the Company to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt; the Company could therefore become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nStrong competition in our primary market area may limit asset growth and profitability.\nWe encounter strong competition from other financial institutions in our primary market area. In addition, established financial institutions not already operating in our primary market area may open branches at future dates. In the conduct of certain aspects of our business, we also compete with credit unions, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies, real estate companies, Fintech, and other institutions, some of which are not subject to the same degree of regulation or restrictions as are imposed upon us. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer services that we do not provide. In addition, many of these competitors have numerous branch offices located throughout their extended market areas that provide them with a competitive advantage. Finally, these institutions may have differing pricing and underwriting standards, which may adversely affect our company through the loss of business or causing a misalignment in our risk-return relationship. No assurance can be given that such competition will not have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations.\nThe carrying value of intangible assets, such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles, may be adversely affected.\nWhen a Company completes an acquisition, intangibles, such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles, are recorded on the date of acquisition as an asset. Current accounting guidance requires an evaluation for impairment, and the Company would perform such impairment analysis at least annually. A significant adverse change in expected future cash flows, sustained adverse change in the Company\u2019s common stock, or a decline in core deposit balances could require the asset to become impaired. If impaired, the Company would incur a charge to earnings that could have a significant impact on the results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the performance of the Company\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the performance of the Company\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties, and its financial condition could be adversely affected if it relies on misleading information.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, the Company may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information, which the Company does not independently verify. The Company also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, the Company may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the customer. The Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent it relies on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nLoss of any of our key personnel could disrupt our operations and result in reduced revenues or increased expenses.\nWe are a relationship-driven organization. A key aspect of our business strategy is for our senior officers to have primary contact with our customers. Our growth and development to date have been, in large part, a result of these personalized relationships with our customer base.\nOur senior officers have considerable experience in the banking industry and related financial services and are extremely valuable and would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of these officers could have a material adverse effect upon future prospects. Although we have entered into employment contracts with certain senior officers, we cannot offer any assurance that they and other key employees will remain employed by us. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on operations and possibly result in reduced revenues or increased expenses.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure controls could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of the Company\u2019s ongoing monitoring of internal controls, it may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control that require remediation. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company continually works on improving its internal controls. However, the Company cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that it implements and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of the Company\u2019s internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s risk-management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Company maintains an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that it faces. These risks include: interest-rate, credit, liquidity, operations, reputation, compliance, and litigation. While the Company assesses and improves this program on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that its approach and framework for risk management and related controls will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in its business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the Company\u2019s risk-management program, or if its controls break down, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nNegative public opinion could damage the Company's reputation and adversely impact liquidity and profitability.\nAs a financial institution, the Company\u2019s earnings, liquidity, and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion of the Company and of the financial services industry as a whole. Negative public opinion could result from the Company's actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any product or service sold by it to meet its clients\u2019 expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, corporate governance and acquisitions, or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company's ability to keep, attract and/or retain customers and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action. Negative public opinion could also affect the Company's ability to borrow funds in the unsecured wholesale debt markets.\nNegative perception of the Company through social media may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nThe Company\u2019s reputation is critical to the success of its business. The Company believes that its brand image has been well received by customers, reflecting the fact that the brand image, like the Company\u2019s business, is based in part on trust and confidence. The Company\u2019s reputation and brand image could be negatively affected by rapid and widespread distribution of publicity through social media channels. The Company\u2019s reputation could also be affected by the Company\u2019s association with clients affected negatively through social media distribution, or other third parties, or by circumstances outside of the Company\u2019s control. Negative publicity, whether true or untrue, could affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract or retain customers, or cause the Company to incur additional liabilities or costs, or result in additional regulatory scrutiny.\nLoss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase our funding costs.\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. We compete with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. Funding costs may increase because we may lose deposits and replace them with more expensive sources of funding, clients may shift their deposits into higher cost products or we may need to raise interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin, net interest income and net income.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s income and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and the policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory agencies. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the prepayment of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding. The impact of these changes may be magnified if the Company does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to reflect such interest rate changes in pricing its products is influenced by competitive pressures. Fluctuations in these areas may adversely affect the Company and its shareholders. The Company is often at a competitive disadvantage in managing its costs of funds compared to the large regional or national banks that have access to the national and international capital markets.\nThe Company generally seeks to maintain a neutral position in terms of the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or re-price during any period so that it may reasonably maintain its net interest margin; however, interest rate fluctuations, loan prepayments, loan production, deposit flows, and competitive pressures are constantly changing and influence the ability to maintain a neutral position. Generally, the Company\u2019s earnings will be more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates depending upon the variance in volume of assets and liabilities that mature and re-price in any period. The extent and duration of the sensitivity will depend on the cumulative variance over time, the velocity and direction of changes in interest rates, shape and slope of the yield curve, and whether the Company is more asset sensitive or liability sensitive. Accordingly, the Company may not be successful in maintaining a neutral position and, as a result, the Company\u2019s net interest margin may be affected.\nLiquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or an unforeseen outflow of cash.\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. Due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or the Company, our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or an unforeseen outflow of cash or deposits which could constrain our ability to make new loans or meet our existing commitments to loan and deposit customers and could ultimately jeopardize our overall liquidity and capitalization.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to operational, technological, and organizational risk may adversely affect the Company.\nSimilar to other financial institutions, the Company is exposed to many types of operational and technological risk, including reputation, legal, and compliance risk. The Company\u2019s ability to grow and compete is dependent on its ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure while it expands and integrates acquired businesses. Operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, occurrences of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, and exposure to external events. The Company is dependent on its operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. From time to time, it may need to change or upgrade its technology infrastructure. The Company may experience disruption, and it may face additional exposure to these risks during the course of making such changes. If the Company would acquire another financial institution or bank branch operations, it would face additional challenges when integrating different operational platforms. Such integration efforts may be more disruptive to the business and/or more costly than anticipated.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide key components of its business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access. While the Company has selected these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problem caused by these third parties, including poor performance of services, failure to provide services, disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor and failure to handle current or higher volumes, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business, and may harm its reputation. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt the Company\u2019s operations if those difficulties affect the vendor\u2019s ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to the Company\u2019s business operations.\nThe operational functions of business counterparties over which the Company may have limited or no control may experience disruptions that could adversely impact the Company.\nEvery year, retailers and service providers are the target of data systems incursions which result in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other financial data of their customers and users. These incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including the Company. Although our systems are not breached in such incursions, these events can cause the Company to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to the Company and its customers. In some cases, the Company may be required to reimburse customers for the losses they incur. Other possible points of intrusion or disruption not within the Company\u2019s control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (\u201ccloud\u201d) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability or result in the loss of money, which could damage our reputation and our business.\nWe rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a possible security breach, our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. To date, the Company has not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but the Company\u2019s systems and those of its customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that the Company could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by the Company and its customers. If one or more such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our customers\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers\u2019 operations, or result in the loss of money. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability, financial loss, and damage to our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We have implemented security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, which could result in damage to our reputation and our business.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nNonperforming assets adversely affect the Company in various ways. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans, which adversely affects its income and increases loan administration costs. When the Company receives collateral through foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the related loan to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, which may result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets also increases the Company\u2019s risk profile, which may reduce the amount of liquidity available to the Company and require a higher level of capital in light of such risks. The Company utilizes various techniques such as workouts, restructurings, and loan sales to manage problem assets. Increases in or negative adjustments in the value of these problem assets, the underlying collateral, or in the borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, including origination of new loans. There can be no assurance that the Company will avoid increases in nonperforming assets in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in its loan portfolio.\nLike all financial institutions, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans that its borrowers may not repay in their entirety. The Company believes that it maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date and in compliance with applicable accounting and regulatory guidance. However, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. Accounting measurements related to impairment and the allowance for loan losses require significant estimates that are subject to uncertainty and changes relating to new information and changing circumstances. The significant uncertainties surrounding the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to execute their business models successfully through changing economic environments, competitive challenges, and other factors complicate the Company\u2019s estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan. Because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, the actual losses may vary from current estimates. The Company expects fluctuations in the loan loss provisions due to the uncertain economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to decrease the allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. Any such required additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s concentration in loans secured by real estate may adversely affect earnings due to changes in the real estate markets.\nThe Company offers a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer, and other loans. Many of the Company\u2019s loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in the Company\u2019s market areas. A major change in the real estate markets, resulting in deterioration in the value of this collateral, or in the local or national economy, could adversely affect borrowers\u2019 ability to pay these loans, which in turn could negatively affect the Company. Risks of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry; the Company tries to limit its exposure to these risks by monitoring extensions of credit carefully. The Company cannot fully eliminate credit risk; thus, credit losses will occur in the future. Additionally, changes in the real estate market also affect the value of foreclosed assets, and therefore, additional losses may occur when management determines it is appropriate to sell the assets.\nThe Company has a significant exposure in commercial real estate, and loans with this type of collateral are viewed as having more risk of default.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio consists primarily of owner-operated properties and other commercial properties. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property to service the debt. Cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions, and a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default. Because the Company\u2019s loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s banking regulators generally give commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies, and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s loan portfolio contains construction and development loans, and a decline in real estate values and economic conditions would adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the loans and have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nAlthough most of the Company\u2019s construction and development loans are secured by real estate, the Company believes that, in the case of the majority of these loans, the real estate collateral by itself may not be a sufficient source for repayment of the loan if real estate values decline. If the Company is required to liquidate the collateral securing a construction and development loan to satisfy the debt, its earnings and capital may be adversely affected. A period of reduced real estate values may continue for some time, resulting in potential adverse effects on the Company\u2019s earnings and capital.\nThe Company\u2019s credit standards and its on-going credit assessment processes might not protect it from significant credit losses.\nThe Company assumes credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. The Company manages credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions and a continuous quality assessment process of credit already extended. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize local lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. The Company\u2019s credit administration function employs risk management techniques to help ensure that problem loans are promptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide the Company with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary and to take appropriate corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk.\nAlthough the Company emphasizes local lending practices, the Company purchases certain loans through a third-party lending program. These portfolios include consumer loans and carry risks associated with the borrower, changes in the economic environment, and the vendor themselves. The Company manages these risks through policies that require minimum credit scores and other underwriting requirements, robust analysis of actual performance versus expected performance, as well as ensuring compliance with the Company's vendor management program. While these policies are designed to manage the risks associated with these loans, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit losses.\nThe Company\u2019s focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase its credit risk.\nMost of the Company\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates negatively impact this important customer sector, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by the Company in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Any deterioration of the borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate which secures a significant portion of its loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if the Company is forced to foreclose upon such loans.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. The Company relies upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such real estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment that adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of the Company\u2019s loans may be more or less valuable than anticipated at the time the loans were made. If a default occurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, the Company may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nThe Company is subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements as a result of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and the Dodd-Frank Act, the short-term and long-term impact of which is uncertain.\nThe Company is subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which each must maintain. From time to time, regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies have established stricter capital requirements and leverage limits for banking organizations, such as the Bank, that are based on the Basel III regulatory capital reforms. These stricter capital requirements were fully-implemented on January 1, 2019. While the Economic Growth Act and recent federal banking regulations established a simplified leverage capital framework for smaller banks, these more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital and adversely affect future growth opportunities. In addition, if the Company fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and/or other regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, could adversely affect the Company or the businesses in which the Company is engaged.\nThe Company is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision, and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations. Laws and regulations change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, and the FDIC\u2019s DIF. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively affect the Company or its ability to increase the value of its business. Such changes could include higher capital requirements, and increased insurance premiums, increased compliance costs, reductions of noninterest income, and limitations on services that can be provided. Actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against the Company could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defend itself and may lead to liability or penalties that materially affect the Company and its shareholders. Future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations or enforcement could be materially adverse to the Company and its shareholders.\nSee the section of this report entitled \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d for additional information on the statutory and regulatory issues that affect the Company\u2019s business.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings and capital.\nThe authorities that promulgate accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB), the United States Securities Exchange Commission (the SEC), and other regulatory authorities, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of financial statements for prior periods. Such changes could also impact the capital levels of the Company and the Bank or require the Company to incur additional personnel or technology costs. Most notably, new guidance on the calculation of credit reserves using current expected credit losses, referred to as CECL, was finalized in June 2016. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023. To implement the new standard, the Company will incur costs related to data collection and documentation, technology and training. For additional information, see \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. If the Company is required to materially increase the level of the allowance for loan losses or incurs additional expenses to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, such changes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s capital levels, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax rates applicable to the Company may cause impairment of deferred tax assets.\nThe Company determines deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method. Under this method, each asset and liability is examined to determine the difference between its book basis and its tax basis. The difference between the book basis and the tax basis of each asset and liability is multiplied by the Company\u2019s marginal tax rate to determine the net deferred tax asset or liability. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods.\nThe marginal tax rate applicable to the Company, as with all entities subject to federal income tax, is based on the Company\u2019s taxable income. If the Company\u2019s taxable income declines such that the Company\u2019s marginal tax rate declines, the change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities would result in an expense during the period that a lower marginal tax rate occurs. If changes in tax rates and laws are enacted, the company will recognize the changes in the period in which they occur. Changes in tax rates and laws could impair the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and result in an expense associated with the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company may be required to transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) index in the future.\nThe Company has certain variable-rate loans indexed to LIBOR to calculate the loan interest rate. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has previously announced that the continued availability of the LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021. In November 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on its intention to extend the retirement date of certain offered rates whereby the publication of the one week and two month LIBOR offered rates will cease after December 31, 2021; but, the publication of the remaining LIBOR offered rates will continue until June 30, 2023. Given consumer protection, litigation, and reputation risks, federal bank regulators have indicated that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would create safety and soundness risks and that they will examine bank practices accordingly. Therefore, the agencies encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.\nIt is difficult to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based variable-rate loans, as well as LIBOR-based securities, subordinated notes, trust preferred securities, or other securities or financial arrangements. The transition to alternative reference rate for new contracts, or the implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under the Company\u2019s existing loan agreements with borrowers or other financial arrangements, could change the Company\u2019s market risk profile, interest margin, interest spread and pricing models, may cause the Company to incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept a substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers or other counter-parties over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. Remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, pandemics, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, pandemics, natural disasters, and other environmental risks, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s wealth management revenue is directly impacted by the market value of assets under management, which could adversely impact Company profitability.\nA significant portion of revenue from wealth management services is based on the market value of assets under management, which may decrease due to a variety of factors including an economic slowdown. Any sustained period of lower market values of assets under management would adversely affect the Company\u2019s wealth management revenue and, as a result, would also adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThere are risks resulting from the use of models in our business.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating model output would be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.\nOur earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies.\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve affect us significantly. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold. Those policies determine to a significant extent our cost of funds for lending and investing. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Federal Reserve policies can also affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. For example, a tightening of the money supply by the Federal Reserve could reduce the demand for a borrower's products and services. This could adversely affect the borrower\u2019s earnings and ability to repay a loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business strategies depends on our ability to identify and recruit individuals with experience and relationships in our primary markets.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy will require us to continue to attract, hire, motivate and retain skilled personnel to develop new customer relationships as well as new financial products and services. The market for qualified management personnel is competitive, which has contributed to salary and employee benefit costs that have risen and are expected to continue to rise, which may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s net income. In addition, the process of identifying and recruiting individuals with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy is often lengthy, and we may not be able to effectively integrate these individuals into our operations. Our inability to identify, recruit and retain talented personnel to manage our operations effectively and in a timely manner could limit our growth, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nCompliance with laws, regulations and supervisory guidance, both new and existing, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws, regulations and supervision from both federal and state agencies. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including receivership. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nLaws and regulations, and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto, generally are intended to benefit consumers, borrowers and depositors, but not stockholders. The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenues, costs, earnings, and capital levels. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations.\nWith the incoming Biden administration, a Democratic controlled Congress, and changes in leadership at federal agencies such as the CFPB, we expect that financial institutions will remain heavily regulated in the near future and that additional laws or regulations may be adopted further regulating specific banking practices. Future legislation, regulation and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including the Company\u2019s business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nThe CFPB may increase our regulatory compliance burden and could affect the consumer financial products and services that we offer.\nAmong the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s significant regulatory changes, it created a new financial consumer protection agency, the CFPB. The CFPB is reshaping the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive consumer finance products or practices, which are directly affecting the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services. This agency\u2019s broad rulemaking authority includes identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any consumer financial transaction, financial product or service. Although the CFPB has jurisdiction over banks with $10 billion or greater in assets, rules, regulations and policies issued by the CFPB may also apply to the Company or its subsidiaries by virtue of the adoption of such policies and best practices by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Further, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by the Company\u2019s primary regulators. The total costs and limitations related to this additional regulatory agency and the limitations and restrictions that will be placed upon the Company with respect to its consumer product and service offerings have yet to be determined in their entirety. However, these costs, limitations and restrictions may produce significant, material effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition of Fincastle\nCombining Fincastle into the Company may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than we expect.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the business of Fincastle into the business of the Company without materially disrupting the existing customer relationships of Fincastle or the Company. If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine the businesses of the Company and Fincastle. To realize these anticipated benefits, the Company will integrate Fincastle\u2019s business into its own. The integration process in the Merger could result in the disruption of ongoing business, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that affect adversely the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. If the Company experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be disruptions that cause the Company to lose customers or cause customers to withdraw their deposits from Fincastle or the Bank, or other unintended consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition after the Merger. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company for an indeterminate period after consummation of the Merger.\nThe Company may not be able to effectively integrate the operations of Fincastle into the Bank.\nThe future operating performance of the Company and the Bank will depend, in part, on the success of the merger of Fincastle with and into the Bank. The success of the subsidiary bank merger will, in turn, depend on a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to (i) integrate the operations and branches of Fincastle and the Bank, (ii) retain the deposits and customers of Fincastle and the Bank, (iii) control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from the Merger in a manner that enables the combined bank to improve its overall operating efficiencies, and (iv) retain and integrate the appropriate personnel of Fincastle into the operations of the Bank, and reduce overlapping bank personnel. The integration of Fincastle and the Bank will require the dedication of the time and resources of the Bank\u2019s management and may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day business of the Bank. If the Bank is unable to successfully integrate Fincastle, the Bank may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger.\nBefore the Merger may be completed, the Company and the Bank must obtain approvals from the Federal Reserve and the SCC. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger and the subsidiary bank merger, imposing additional costs on the combined company or limiting the revenues of the combined company, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger.\nA significant delay in the completion of the Merger could have a material adverse effect on the Company and Fincastle as a combined company.\nThe merger agreement with Fincastle is subject to a number of conditions that must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include, among others: (1) approval of the Merger by the Company\u2019s and Fincastle\u2019s shareholders, (2) receipt of all required approvals from bank regulatory authorities and expiration of all applicable waiting periods, (3) absence of any law or order prohibiting or restricting the completion of the Merger, and (4) effectiveness of the Company\u2019s registration statement filed with the SEC. Certain costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, must be paid even if the Merger is not completed. If the Merger is not completed, we would have to recognize these expenses and our management would have committed substantial time and resources without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger.\nIf these conditions to the completion of the Merger are not fulfilled when expected and, as a result, the completion of the Merger is delayed, the diversion of management attention from pursuing other opportunities, the constraints in the merger agreement on the ability to make significant changes to each company\u2019s ongoing business during the pendency of the Merger, the incurrence of additional merger related expenses, and other market and economic factors could have a material adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company and Fincastle will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company and Fincastle. These uncertainties may impair the Company\u2019s and Fincastle\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with the Company and Fincastle to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company and Fincastle. Retention of certain employees by the Company and Fincastle may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company or Fincastle. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the Company or Fincastle, the Company\u2019s or Fincastle\u2019s business, or the business of the combined company following the Merger, could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the Company and Fincastle have each agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to closing and refrain from taking certain specified actions until the Merger occurs, which may prevent Fincastle from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nRisks Related To The Company\u2019s Securities\nThe Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for substantially all of its revenue.\nThe Company is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through the Bank. As a result, the Company relies on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of its revenues. There are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company. Also, the Company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to service debt, pay obligations, or pay a cash dividend to the holders of its common stock and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Further, although the Company has historically paid a cash dividend to the holders of its common stock, holders of the common stock are not entitled to receive dividends, and regulatory or economic factors may cause the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to consider, among other things, the reduction of dividends paid on the Company\u2019s common stock even if the Bank continues to pay dividends to the Company.\nThere is a limited trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock; it may be difficult to sell shares.\nThe trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock has been relatively limited. Even if a more active market develops, there can be no assurance that a more active and liquid trading market for the common stock will exist in the future. Consequently, shareholders may not be able to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares. In addition, the Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of its common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of the common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, could cause the price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline, or reduce the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital through future sales of common stock. The lack of liquidity of the investment in the common shares should be carefully considered when making an investment decision.\nFuture issuances of the Company\u2019s common stock could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could be dilutive.\nThe Company is not restricted from issuing additional authorized shares of common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock. Issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the expectation that such issuances might occur, including in connection with acquisitions by the Company, could materially adversely affect the market price of the shares of common stock and could be dilutive to shareholders. Because the Company\u2019s decision to issue common stock in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors, it cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of possible future issuances of its common stock. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s shareholders bear the risk that future issuances will reduce the market price of the common stock and dilute their stock holdings in the Company.\nCurrent economic conditions or other factors may cause volatility in the Company\u2019s common stock value.\nThe value of publicly traded stocks in the financial services sector can be volatile. The value of the Company\u2019s common stock can also be affected by a variety of factors such as expected results of operations, actual results of operations, actions taken by shareholders, news or expectations based on the performance of others in the financial services industry, and expected impacts of a changing regulatory environment. These factors not only impact the value of the Company\u2019s common stock but could also affect the liquidity of the stock given the Company\u2019s size, geographical footprint, and industry.\nThe Company\u2019s subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt are superior to its common stock, which may limit its ability to pay dividends on common stock in the future.\nThe Company's ability to pay dividends on common stock is also limited by contractual restrictions under its subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt. Interest must be paid on the subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt before dividends may be paid to common shareholders. The Company is current in its interest payments on subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt; however, it has the right to defer distributions on its junior subordinated debt, during which time no dividends may be paid on its common stock. If the Company does not have sufficient earnings in the future and begins to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debt, it will be unable to pay dividends on its common stock until it becomes current on those distributions.\nThe Company\u2019s governing documents and Virginia law contain anti-takeover provisions that could negatively affect its shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and the Virginia Stock Corporation Act contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the Board of Directors to deal with attempts to acquire control of the Company. These provisions and the ability to set the voting rights, preferences, and other terms of any series of outstanding preferred stock and preferred stock that may be issued, may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may discourage takeovers (which certain shareholders may deem to be in their best interest). To the extent that such takeover attempts are discouraged, temporary fluctuations in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts may be inhibited. These provisions also could discourage or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, even though such transactions may be favorable to the interests of shareholders, and could potentially adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 18554, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FXNC"}
