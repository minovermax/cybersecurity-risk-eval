{"cik": "1037646", "company": "METTLER TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nFactors Affecting Our Future Operating Results\nWe are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and have a significant concentration of business in China.\nWe conduct business in many countries, including emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings. For example, our Chinese operations accounted for 18% of sales to external customers, approximately 30% of our global production, and 34% of total segment profit during 2019. In addition to the currency risks discussed below, international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us, including the following:\n\u2022\nlocal tariffs and trade barriers;\n\u2022\ncountries may add to, revise, or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing local operations and/or mandatory salary increases;\n\u2022\ncredit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local customers and distributors;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022\nnationalization of private enterprises which may result in the confiscation of assets, as we hold significant assets around the world in the form of property, plant, and equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable, as well as $165.5 million of cash at December 31, 2019 in our Chinese subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on investments and/or limitations regarding foreign ownership;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences, including tax disputes, imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of new or expansion of current travel restrictions or the intensification of trade wars;\n\u2022\nother uncertain local economic, political, and social conditions, including hyper-inflationary conditions or periods of low or no productivity growth; and\n\u2022\ncredit tightening or reduction in credit availability for local customers.\nWe must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies. For example, we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in China into other currencies and to repatriate these funds. If we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations, we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in China.\nWe are required to comply with various import, export control, and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners, and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services, and technologies, and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. We follow all relevant laws and continue to do business in Russia. Sanctions imposed on business in Russia may affect the economy and our business in Russia. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation.\nGrowth in emerging markets, especially China, can be volatile and change quickly. While we experienced solid growth in China in 2019, we have also experienced sales declines in past years and we may see volatility in the future. There is also currently economic uncertainty, due in part to the prolonged trade/tariff disputes with the United States. In the short-term, we could also be impacted by the recent new strain of the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak as further described on page 20.\nWe sell primarily to companies in developed countries. An economic downturn in these countries could hurt our operating results.\nMost of our business is derived from companies in developed countries. Economic uncertainty in many parts of the world, including international trade disputes and sovereign debt levels in the European Union and the United States, are situations that we are monitoring closely. If developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession, we could see the following effects:\n\u2022\na drop in demand for our products;\n\u2022\ncompanies being unable to finance their businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining materials and supplies;\n\u2022\npotential devaluation and/or impairment of assets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in collecting accounts receivables;\n\u2022\nan increase in accounts receivable write-offs; and\n\u2022\ngreater foreign exchange rate volatility affecting our profitability and cash flow.\nEconomic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures. Customers may also purchase lower-cost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve. These conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business.\nCurrency fluctuations affect our operating profits.\nOur earnings are affected by changing exchange rates. We are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the Swiss franc, euro, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland. When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings go down. We also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc, our earnings also go down. We estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately $1.6 million to $1.8 million annually.\nWe also conduct business throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of these currency exposures is the Chinese renminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese renminbi weakening 1% against the U.S. dollar is a reduction of approximately $1.7 million to $1.9 million annually.\nIn addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and euro. Based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2019, we estimate that a 5% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of $22.8 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.\nConcerns regarding the Eurozone debt levels and market perception related to the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits.\nWe conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency (the Eurozone). Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations. In addition, concerns in recent years have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries.\nThese concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations. In addition, concerns over the effect of this type of financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and, more specifically, on the ability of our Company, our customers, suppliers, and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, on the availability of supplies and materials, and on the demand for our products.\nWe are vulnerable to system failures and data loss risks, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, support our customers, fulfill orders, and bill, collect, and make payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, malicious employees or employee negligence, computer viruses, and other events. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data, or reduced functionality. A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, fraudulent or negligent loss of assets, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or data loss as a result of system failures.\nCustomers may use our products and/or software to generate or manage confidential information. Though we take steps to ensure our products and/or software are secure, it is possible customers could lose confidential information stored on our products. If a customer alleges system failures in our products and/or software cause or contribute to a loss, we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition and legal liability.\nWe also are in the process of implementing a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a Company-wide enterprise resource planning system. This has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multi-year period. We have implemented the program in our Swiss, Chinese, U.K., Benelux, German, and certain U.S. and Southeast Asia operations. We estimate that we have more than 80% of our users on the program and will continue to implement additional locations and functionality over the coming years. If our implementation is flawed, we could suffer interruptions in operations and customer-facing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data, experience reduced functionality, or have delays in reporting financial information. It may take us longer to implement the program than we have planned, and the project may cost us more than we have estimated, either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies. In addition, the program has increased our\nreliance on a single information technology system, which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption.\nOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a cybersecurity attack.\nAs described in the above section, we rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders, support our customers, and bill, collect and make payments. Our system and processes may be susceptible to damage or interruption from cybersecurity incidents, such as terrorist or hacker attacks, the introduction of malicious computer viruses, ransomware, falsification of banking and other information, insider risk, or other security breaches. If there is a cybersecurity incident, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of assets or data, or reduced functionality. Many of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality a cybersecurity incident could cause. Security breaches of our systems which allow inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information and misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, customers, or suppliers could result in our suffering significant financial and reputational damage.\nCustomers may use our products and/or software to generate or manage critical information. Though we take steps to ensure our products and/or software are secure, it is possible that a cyber attack could result in the loss or compromise of critical information. If a customer alleges that a cyber attack causes or contributes to a loss or compromise of critical information, we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition.\nWhile we attempt to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of proactive measures, including employee training and awareness, technical security controls, enhanced data protection, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems remain potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe our mitigation measures reduce, but cannot eliminate, the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Despite any precautions we may take, a cybersecurity incident could harm our reputation and financial condition and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to respond to such events. Our cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or asset or data loss as a result of cybersecurity incidents.\nIn addition, regulatory or legislative action related to cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection worldwide, such as the European GDPR which went into effect in May 2018, may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products or services. We expect cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement. If we violate or fail to comply with such regulatory or legislative requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned, and such fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins, gain market share, and maintain a technological advantage.\nOur markets are highly competitive. Many are fragmented both geographically and by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well established in their markets. In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own. There has also been an increase in the consolidation of precision instrument companies in recent years. Any consolidation within our market could result in competitors becoming larger and having greater financial and other resources than our own. Some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which, although relatively small in size today, could become larger companies in\ntheir home markets. Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets, emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices. Although we believe that our products and services have advantages over our competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages.\nOur ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted.\nWe have key manufacturing facilities located in China, Europe, and the United States. Many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities. In addition, a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers, in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties. If we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason, such as the recent new strain of the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak further described on page 20, strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, cybersecurity attacks, fire, earthquakes, hurricanes, or other events beyond our control, we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services resulting in lost sales. It may be expensive to resolve these issues, even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies. More importantly, customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption.\nOur business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material.\nWe purchase most of our raw materials, components, and supplies from multiple suppliers. Some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply, and disruption of these sources could affect our ability to manufacture products. Even where multiple sources of materials and components are available, the quality of the alternative materials, regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use in manufacturing, and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales. If we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time, this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner.\nIf we do not introduce new products and enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete over time, which would harm our operating results. To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer service and support. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments. In developing new products, we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability. As a result, we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities.\nA prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results. A reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales.\nOur products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and chemical industries. Consolidation in these industries hurt our sales in prior years. In recent years, there has been an increase in consolidation within these industries. A prolonged global economic downturn, a downturn affecting one or more of these industries, or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control, including the resources available for purchasing\nequipment, the spending priorities among various types of equipment, and policies regarding capital expenditures. Any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability. A decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers' ability to purchase our products.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various other jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates and tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or rates, changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and material adjustments from tax audits.\nIn particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.\nOur tax expense and tax obligations could increase as a result of changing application of tax law.\nGovernments are facing greater pressure on public finances, which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations. Governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations. The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (\"OECD\") is also performing an economic impact study that is expected to develop a solution to the digital economy, and also propose a supplement to the current transfer pricing arm's length standard for allocating profit. While the OECD's current focus appears to be related to the digital economy and consumer businesses, there is a possibility that the OECD also proposes changes to business-to-business transfer pricing regulations. Any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations, on repatriation of dividends, earnings or capital, or on transfer pricing, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden, which would negatively affect our profitability. Potential OECD changes impacting consumer businesses could also have an unfavorable effect on some of our key customer segments such as pharmaceutical, and food and beverage, which could result in a decline or delay in capital spending by our customers and a resulting decline in our revenues and lower profitability.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control, which could harm our business.\nWe sell some products through third parties, including distributors and value-added resellers. This exposes us to various risks, including competitive pressure, concentration of sales volumes, credit risks, and compliance risks. We may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings. Distributors may also face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivables. Violations of the FCPA or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could materially impact our business. In addition to financial risk, actions of some of our distributors could cause reputational harm, especially if our products are involved. Risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nA terrorism attack, other geopolitical crisis, or widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak, could negatively affect various aspects of our business, including our workforce and supply chain, and make it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers, and could result in reduced demand from our customers.\nOur global operations are susceptible to global events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, and natural disasters. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition.\nWe are also susceptible to a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as the recent 2019 Coronavirus outbreak first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 (\"Wuhan Coronavirus\"), resulting in thousands of confirmed cases in China and many additional cases identified in other countries in which we conduct business. The outbreak of the Wuhan Coronavirus has caused the Chinese government to implement quarantines of Wuhan and surrounding areas and implement significant restrictions on travel. The Chinese government has also implemented work restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work. These quarantines, travel bans, and other restrictions have been put in place on a national level until February 3, 2020, with several provinces in which we have manufacturing facilities and sales offices extending that date to February 9, 2020. At this time, it is unclear if the Chinese government will further extend any of the current restrictions or if further restrictions will be put into place by the government. In addition, many countries have placed significant bans on travel to and from China, with many countries and airlines suspending flights to and from mainland China.\nAs a result of pandemic outbreaks, including the Wuhan Coronavirus, businesses can be shut down, supply chains can be interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable, and individuals can become ill, quarantined, or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. Governmental mandates may require forced shutdowns of our facilities for extended or indefinite periods. In addition, these widespread outbreaks of illness, particularly in China, North America, Europe, or other locations (especially Asia Pacific) significant to our operations, could adversely affect our workforce resulting in serious health issues and absenteeism. Pandemic outbreaks, including the Wuhan Coronavirus, could also substantially interfere with general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business, or prospects. If our operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff, which may be more expensive. Alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers, each of which would affect our results of operations. Further, if our customers\u2019 businesses are similarly affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others, our operating results could be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain, maintain, and enforce patents on our technology, maintain our trademarks, and protect our trade secrets. Our patents may not provide complete protection or may expire, and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents. Our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed. We may experience a decline in sales and/or profitability if any of these things occur. Competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand. Improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur.\nWe may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. The cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome, and management attention could be diverted. If we are unsuccessful in such litigation, we may have to pay damages, stop the infringing activity, and/or\nobtain a license. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to sell some of our products, which could result in a decline in our revenues.\nDepartures of key employees could impair our operations.\nKey employees could leave the Company. If any key employees stopped working for us, our operations could be harmed. Important R&D personnel may leave and join competitors, which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects. We have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives.\nWe may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations. We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination in various facilities. In addition, some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future. These sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation. Accordingly, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by regulations and market expectations related to sourcing and our supply chain, including conflict minerals.\nThe SEC has adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives, namely tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold, known as conflict minerals. Companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we have incurred additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, due diligence procedures we have implemented to understand the origins of the minerals we use in our operations may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are DRC conflict free, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as DRC conflict free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and/or lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at prices similar to the past, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.\nFuture laws, regulations, or customers may make additional demands on supply chain transparency. These demands can include more transparency into the activities of our suppliers with regard to human rights and sustainable sourcing. We have significant protections in place to ensure we partner with responsible suppliers, but increased demands may cause us to incur increased supply chain costs. If we cannot satisfy customers' demands, we may lose business, and if we cannot meet new regulatory requirements, we may have to alter our sourcing at increased expense.\nWe may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations. United States trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, as well as other political policies in the United States, China, the U.K., and certain European countries, may also impact global trade or create uncertainty impacting our business.\nOur products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products, including design and development, product safety, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, and distribution. We also operate a global business and are subject to various laws and regulations in the many markets where we do business, including those relating to competition, employment and labor practices, international trade, and corruption. If we fail to comply with these regulations, or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be subject to investigation costs, reputational harm, fines, criminal prosecution, and other damages that could impact our profitability.\nPolitical policy in the United States, China, the U.K., and certain European countries may impact global trade or create uncertainty. The United States government has recently adopted a new approach to trade policy and in certain cases to renegotiate, or possibly terminate, certain existing trade agreements. The United States government has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, particularly those produced in China, and has raised the possibility of imposing further tariff increases or expanding the scope of the tariffs. As a result, certain foreign governments, including the Chinese government, have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the United States.\nIn June 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union (\"E.U.\"), commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". On October 17, 2019, the U.K. Prime Minister and the E.U. agreed to new terms for the country's exit from the E.U., which now has all necessary parliamentary approvals. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally left the E.U. The U.K. and the E.U. are now in a transition period, where they have until the end of 2020 to attempt to negotiate a new trade agreement. If the U.K. leaves the E.U. without being able to negotiate an agreement, it may have an adverse impact on labor and trade and may create currency volatility. In the absence of a future trade deal, the U.K.'s trade with the European Union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the World Trade Organization, resulting in possible higher importation costs of our products. In addition, the movement of goods between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the E.U. may be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of Brexit on our business. However, Brexit could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThese various trade policy and regulatory actions described above may restrict our access to lower-cost countries in certain circumstances or otherwise create uncertainty, negatively impact global markets, and make it more difficult or costly for us to import our products into certain countries. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other government action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies could also lead to an economic downturn and/or could create unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates (see above description \"currency fluctuations affect our operating profits\"). In times of uncertainty, some customers delay investments or defer normal replacement cycles, which could have an adverse impact on our sales. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies have the potential to adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nWe may face risks associated with future acquisitions.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines, technologies, or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations, technologies, and products; diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company. If we successfully identify acquisitions in the future, completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners, increases in our debt and contingent liabilities, and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets. Any of these acquisition-related risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nLarger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering or expanding their presence, which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets. In addition, we may not be able to identify, successfully complete, or integrate potential acquisitions in the future. Even if we can do so, we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results. We are also required to estimate the fair value of certain assets acquired or liabilities assumed. Such fair values may be based on valuation models which are subject to inherent uncertainties and our judgments regarding certain assumptions.\nWe may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $536.0 million and other intangible assets of $206.2 million.\nOur business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense. We make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The evaluation may be based on valuation models that estimate fair value. In preparing the valuation models, we consider a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic conditions, future cash flows, and transactions and market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses. The significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth, controllable cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates, and discount rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets.\nShould any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash flows, including from a prolonged economic slowdown, we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.\nOur amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change.\nWe have debt and we may incur substantially more debt, which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.\nWe have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion, net of cash of $207.8 million. Our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness.\nThe existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences. For example, it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development, and other corporate requirements; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in raw material costs; limit our ability to respond to business opportunities; limit our ability to borrow additional funds, which may be necessary; and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants, which, if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured, could result in an event of default under our debt instruments.\nThe agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business.\nThe note purchase agreements governing our notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. The restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate, merge, sell, or lease all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios.\nOur ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including economic, financial, and industry conditions. The breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes and/or under our credit facility. An event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable. Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes.\nThe lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments, reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity.\nWe have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the Company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to $1.1 billion. Our credit facility is provided by a group of 15 financial institutions, which individually have between 1% and 11% of the total funding commitment. At December 31, 2019, we had borrowings of $521.0 million outstanding under our credit facility. Our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders\u2019 financial condition and ability to make funds available. Even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds, if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt, such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations. This could result in us being unable to borrow the full $1.1 billion amount available.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") by the end of 2021. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and could result in higher borrowing costs. In addition, if changes are made to the method of calculating LIBOR or LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend certain contracts, including our credit facility and swap arrangements, and we cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be negotiated. This may also result in an increase in our interest rate expense.\nWe make forward-looking statements, and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors.\nWe provide forward-looking statements both in our filings with the SEC and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls, including guidance on anticipated sales growth and earnings per share. You should not rely on forward-looking statements to predict our actual results. Our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties.\nOur forward-looking statements may not be accurate or complete, and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results. New risks also periodically arise. Please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forward-looking statements. See in particular \u201cFactors Affecting Our Future Operating Results\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nIn providing guidance on our future earnings, we evaluate our budgets, strategic plans, and other factors relating to our business. We make assumptions about external factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe outlook for our end markets and the global economy;\n\u2022\nthe impact of external factors on our competition;\n\u2022\nthe financial position of our customers and their willingness to pay for our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe estimated costs of purchasing materials;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in personnel costs;\n\u2022\nour estimated income tax expense; and\n\u2022\nrates for currency exchange, particularly between the Swiss franc and the euro and between the Chinese renminbi and the U.S. dollar.\nSome of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time. For example, although no single end-customer accounts for more than 1% of our revenues, if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently, it could have an impact on our results of operations.\nSome of our key internal assumptions include the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to implement our business strategy;\n\u2022\nour ability to implement price increases as forecasted;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs such as our Spinnaker, market penetration, and Field Turbo initiatives;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our programs to improve our service business, including growth, globalization, and productivity initiatives;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and deliver innovative products and services;\n\u2022\nthe continued growth of our sales in emerging markets; and\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of productivity and cost saving initiatives.\nThese internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time. For example, with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets, in certain markets, such as emerging markets, price tends to be a more significant factor in customers\u2019 decisions to purchase our products and services. Furthermore, we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings. Additionally, it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs.\nWe believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes. However, should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, or should we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash flows, we may experience results different than our projections.\nOur ability to generate and repatriate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our share repurchase program, planned capital expenditures, and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate and repatriate cash in the future. This is subject to factors beyond our control, including general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, governmental, and other factors described in this section.\nWe cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our credit facility and the senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur ability to fund our share repurchase program is also dependent on our ability to repatriate our international cash flows. Changes in governmental cash repatriation policies, restrictions, or tax laws could impair our ability to continue our share repurchase program.", "PERMNO": 85621, "SIC": 3826, "TIC": "MTD"}
