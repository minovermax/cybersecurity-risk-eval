{"cik": "1697805", "company": "Bison Capital Acquisition Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following material risk factors and other information in this report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for growth could be seriously impacted. As a result, the trading price, if any, of our Ordinary Shares could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, we face certain material risks and uncertainties related to the business combination with Xynomic. In addition, if we succeed in effecting the business combination, we will face additional and different risks and uncertainties related to the business of Xynomic. Such material risks will be set forth in the proxy statement that we will file with the SEC in connection with the meeting to be called to approve the business combination.\nRisks Related to Bison and the Business Combination\nFollowing the Closing, our only significant asset will be the ownership of 100% of Xynomic\u2019s capital stock, and we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on the appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nFollowing the closing of the business combination, we will have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of 100% of Xynomic\u2019s capital stock. We will depend on Xynomic for distributions, loans, and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our expenses as a publicly traded company, and to pay any dividends with respect to our shares. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing the current indebtedness of Xynomic as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of Xynomic, may limit our ability to obtain cash from Xynomic. Thus, we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our shares. Any future dividend payments are within the absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nWe may not be able to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 that will be applicable to us after the Business Combination. Furthermore, if our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nAs a public company, Bison is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Following the Business Combination, the combined company will continue to be required to provide management\u2019s attestation on internal controls commencing with the Company\u2019s annual report for the year ending December 31, 2019, in accordance with applicable SEC guidance. The standards required for a public company under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 are significantly more stringent than those required of Xynomic as a privately held company. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that will be applicable to the Company after the Business Combination. If we are not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of our common stock.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company with more complex operations following the Business Combination, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company with more complex operations, and particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a blank check company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, public companies are required to furnish a report by their management on their internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by their independent registered public accounting firms, which requirement is subject to certain exceptions. While we remain an emerging growth company, however, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for holders of our common stock.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price at which you purchased it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf the success of competitive drugs;\n\u25cf results of clinical trials of our drug candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents, or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf the level of expenses related to any of our drug candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u25cf the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire, or in-license additional drug candidates or drugs;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines, or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u25cf general economic, industry, and market conditions; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nOur executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their affiliates will continue to exercise significant influence over our company after the Business Combination, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nOur insider shareholders as a group currently own approximately 23.96% of the outstanding voting power of the Company and three outside principal shareholders in aggregate own 21.07% of the outstanding voting power of the Company. After the Business Combination, our executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their affiliates will beneficially hold in aggregate 65.96% of the outstanding voting power, assuming no redemption of the public shares in connection with the Business Combination. Their voting power will increase when and if the public shares are redeemed. If 67% of the public shares are redeemed, they will own approximately 71.92% of the outstanding voting power after the consummation of the Business Combination.\nThese shareholders may have interests, with respect to their common stock, that are different from those of investors in this offering and the concentration of voting power among these shareholders may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, this concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our common stock by:\n\u25cf delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control of us;\n\u25cf impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us; or\n\u25cf discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nAnti-takeover provisions under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nBecause we will be incorporated in Delaware following the Domestication, we will be governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which limits the ability of shareholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for shareholders by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some shareholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nXynomic stockholders have agreed to lock up their Merger Consideration Shares up to nine months after the Closing (subject to certain exceptions) and our Initial Shareholders have agreed to lock up 50% of the Founder Shares until the earlier of (a) one year after the Closing, or (b) the date on which the closing price of the Company common shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period after the Closing and lock up the remaining 50% of the Founder Shares for one year following the Closing. If our Initial Shareholders after the Closing sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after all legal restrictions on resale lapse, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in the ownership of its equity over a three year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We may have experienced such ownership changes in the past, we expect to experience such ownership change related to the Business Combination, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside the Company\u2019s control. Our ability to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards could be limited by an \u201cownership change,\u201d which could result in increased tax liability to the Company, potentially decreasing the value of our common stock. There are additional limitations found under Sections 269, 383, and 384 of the Code that may also limit the use of net operating loss carryforwards that may apply and result in increased tax liability to the Company, potentially decreasing the value of our common stock. In addition, a \u201cSeparate Return Limitation Year\u201d (\u201cSRLY\u201d) generally encompasses all separate return years of a member (or predecessor in a Section 381 or other transaction), including tax years in which it joins a consolidated return of another group. According to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-21, a net operating losses of a member that arises in a SRLY may be applied against consolidated taxable income only to the extent of the loss member\u2019s cumulative contribution to the consolidated taxable income. As a result, this SRLY limitation may also increase the tax liability to the Company (by reducing the carryforward of certain net operating losses that otherwise might be used to offset the amount of taxable gain), potentially decreasing the value of our common stock.\nWe will incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the Business Combination. If we fail to consummate the Business Combination, we may not have sufficient cash available to pay such costs.\nWe expect to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the Business Combination. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the Business Combination is completed. Bison\u2019s and Xynomic\u2019s combined transaction expenses as a result of the Business Combination are currently estimated at approximately $4.26 million, which are comprised of (i) $109,296 in fees and expenses to the Special Committee\u2019s financial advisor, (ii) $1,811,250 in fees to our financial advisors and for banking fee payable to the underwriters, (iii) an estimate of $1,451,145 in legal fees and expenses, (iv) an estimate of $681,932 in accounting and other expenses, and (v) $202,352 relating to other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Business Combination. Additionally, this amount includes the expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing, and mailing of the Merger Prospectus and the solicitation of the approval of our shareholders, and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC, which is estimated based on the Aggregate Merger Consideration of approximately $450 million as provided in the Merger Agreement. If Bison and Xynomic do not consummate the Business Combination, each party will be required to pay its own fees and expenses, and Bison likely will not have sufficient cash available to pay its fees and expenses unless and until it completes a subsequent business combination transaction. Going forward, the combined company will incur transition costs and costs relating to Xynomic\u2019s business operating as a public company, which may adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our common stock.\nBison and its shareholders will only have limited protection of any indemnification, escrow, price adjustment, or other provisions that allow for a post-Closing adjustment to be made to the Closing Consideration Shares in the event that any of the representations and warranties made by Xynomic in the Merger Agreement ultimately proves to be inaccurate or incorrect.\nThe representations and warranties made by Xynomic to Bison in the Merger Agreement will survive for a period of 18 months after the Closing. As a result, after the expiration of such period, Bison and its shareholders will not have the protection of any indemnification, if any representation or warranty made by Xynomic in the Merger Agreement proves to be inaccurate or incorrect or there is a breach of a pre-closing covenant unless there is an intended fraud. Accordingly, to the extent such representations or warranties are incorrect or there is a breach of a pre-closing covenant by Xynomic, Bison would have limited indemnification claims with respect thereto and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Bison\u2019s indemnification is limited to the Escrow Shares and earnings on such shares while held in escrow. Since the Escrow Shares (and related dividends and earnings) serve as the sole source for indemnity, if the business underperforms due to factors that constituted a breach of Xynomic\u2019s representations and warranties or pre-closing covenants, once the Escrow Shares (and related dividends and earnings) are forfeited, they will no longer provide a remedy for indemnification claims for such breaches since they may have already been forfeited.\nPurchases of shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions by our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors, or their affiliates may make it difficult for us to maintain the listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange following the Closing.\nIf our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors, or their affiliates purchase shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our common stock and the number of beneficial holders of our securities would both be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange following the Closing.\nWe may waive one or more of the conditions to the Business Combination.\nWe may agree to waive, in whole or in part, some of the conditions to our obligations to complete the Business Combination, to the extent permitted by our Current Charter and applicable laws. For example, it is a condition to our obligations to close the Business Combination that Xynomic\u2019s representations and warranties are true and correct in all respects as of the Closing Date, except for such inaccuracies that, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement). However, if our board of directors determines that it is in our shareholders\u2019 best interest to waive any such breach, then the board may elect to waive that condition and close the Business Combination. We are not able to waive the condition that our shareholders approve the Business Combination.\nEven if we consummate the Business Combination, there is no guarantee that the public warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless and the terms of our warrants may be amended.\nThe exercise price for our warrants is $11.50 per whole share, subject to certain adjustment. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of Company common shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. There is no guarantee that the public warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration and they may expire worthless.\nIn addition, the warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as the warrant agent, and us provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Company common shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nOur Sponsor, directors, and officers have a conflict of interest in determining to pursue the merger with Xynomic, since certain of their interests, and certain interests of their affiliates and associates, are different from or in addition to (and which may conflict with) the interests of our shareholders.\nOur Initial Shareholders, including our Sponsor and our officers and directors, have interests in and arising from the Business Combination that are different from or in addition to (and which may conflict with) the interests of our public shareholders, which may result in a conflict of interest. These interests include, among other things:\n\u25cf the fact that our Sponsor and our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Tong, paid an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.017 per share, for their 1,509,375 Founder Shares which had a value of approximately $15.7 million based on the closing price of Bison ordinary shares as of December 31, 2018 as reported by Nasdaq and that are not subject to redemption. Such Founder Shares will have no value if we do not complete an initial business combination by the Outside Date; as a result, our Sponsor (and its members, including our executive officers and directors) have a financial incentive to see the Business Combination consummated rather than losing whatever value is attributable to the Founder Shares;\n\u25cf the fact that our Sponsor holds 401,875 private units and will continue to hold 422,062 Company common shares and 200,937 warrants following the separation of such private units upon the consummation of the Business Combination, subject to certain lock-up agreement. Those private units and securities underlying those private units are not subject to redemption and will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination by March 23, 2019 (which will be extended to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by Bison\u2019s board of directors upon receipt of Bison\u2019s shareholders\u2019 approval of the Extension Proposal);\n\u25cf if Bison is unable to complete a business combination by March 23, 2019 (which will be extended to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by Bison\u2019s board of directors upon receipt of Bison\u2019s shareholders\u2019 approval of the Extension Proposal), our Sponsor will be personally liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by Bison for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to Bison, but only if such a vendor or target business has not executed a waiver of claims against the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters;\n\u25cf the continuation of four of our five existing directors as directors of the combined company;\n\u25cf the fact that Bison has issued a $500,000 note to the Sponsor which is convertible into private units at the Sponsor\u2019s discretion at the Closing;\n\u25cf the fact that in addition to the $500,000 notes, the Sponsor has loaned us $100,000 working capital and may need to loan us additional fund through the Closing, which, in the event that the initial business combination does not close, cannot be paid from the proceeds or the interest on such proceeds in the trust account.\n\u25cf the fact that (a) Zhongshan Bison Healthcare Investment Limited (Limited Partnership) (\u201cZhongshan Bison\u201d) is holding 1,553,265 shares of Series B preferred stock of Xynomic representing approximately 2.96% equity interest in Xynomic immediately prior to the Closing, (b) Mr. Peixin Xu, the Chairman of Bison, is the beneficial owner of 21% of Zhongshan Bison and his wife owns 100% of Sponsor;\n\u25cf the fact that the Merger Agreement provides a termination fee of $4,500,000 payable to our Sponsor if (i) the breach by Xynomic causes Bison to not be able to satisfy its obligations under the Merger Agreement relating to preparing and filing a proxy statement/prospectus for obtaining, and obtaining, approval of the Business Combination and the Merger Agreement by its shareholders and not consummating an alternative business combination with another party, or to close the Business Combination on or prior to the Outside Date, or enter into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative business combination by that date, and (ii) Bison ceases operations other than making required distributions to its shareholders pursuant to its organizational documents and its winding up and dissolution as a result of (x) failing to obtain shareholder approval to consummate any alternative business combination or (y) occurrence of an Automatic Redemption Event (as defined in the Current Charter); and\n\u25cf the continued indemnification of current directors and officers of the Company and the continuation of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance after the Business Combination.\n\u25cf $100,000 will not be paid without a business combination\nThese interests may influence our directors in making their recommendation that you vote in favor of the approval of the Business Combination and the transactions contemplated thereby. These interests were considered by our Special Committee and the Board when they approved the Business Combination.\nThe exercise of our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in agreeing to changes or waivers in the terms of the Business Combination may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes to the terms of the Business Combination or waivers of conditions are appropriate and in our shareholders\u2019 best interest.\nIn the period leading up to the Closing, events may occur that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, would require Bison to agree to amend the Merger Agreement, to consent to certain actions taken by Xynomic or to waive rights that Bison is entitled to under the Merger Agreement. Such events could arise because of changes in the course of Xynomic\u2019s business, a request by Xynomic to undertake actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of the Merger Agreement, or the occurrence of other events that would have a material adverse effect on Xynomic\u2019s business and would entitle Bison to terminate the Merger Agreement. In any of such circumstances, it would be at Bison\u2019s discretion, acting through its board of directors, to grant its consent or waive those rights. The existence of the financial and personal interests of our officers and directors described in the preceding risk factors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the directors between what he or they may believe is best for Bison and what he or they may believe is best for himself or themselves in determining whether or not to take the requested action. As of the date of this Form 10-K, Bison does not believe there will be any changes or waivers that Bison\u2019s directors and officers would be likely to make after shareholder approval of the Business Combination Proposal has been obtained. While certain changes could be made without further shareholder approval, Bison will circulate a new or amended Merger Prospectus and re-solicit Bison\u2019s shareholders if changes to the terms of the transaction that would have a material impact on its shareholders are required prior to the vote on the Business Combination Proposal.\nOur public shareholders may experience immediate dilution as a consequence of, among other transactions, the Business Combination, and having a minority share position likely reduces the influence that our current shareholders have on the management of the Company.\nWe anticipate that, upon the completion of the Business Combination, and assuming there are no redemptions, and assuming the issuance of 34,482,758 Company common shares as the Closing Consideration Shares (assuming Closing Merger Consideration of $350 million) and the issuance of 9,852,216 Company common shares as Earnout Shares to Xynomic stockholders upon the Closing, Bison\u2019s public shareholders will retain an ownership interest of 12.54% in the Company post-Closing and our Initial Shareholders and affiliates (including the underwriters in our IPO) will retain an ownership interest of 3.75% in the Company post-Closing. These relative percentages assume the automatic conversion of 6,469,562 rights of Bison into 646,956 common shares at the Closing. In addition, if any of our public shareholders exercises its redemption rights, the aggregate ownership interest of our public shareholders in the Company post-Closing will decrease and the ownership interest of our Initial Shareholders and the ownership interest of Xynomic stockholders in the Company post-Closing, will increase. Upon the Closing, Bison will own 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Xynomic. If the actual facts are different than these assumptions (which they are likely to be), the percentage ownership retained by our existing shareholders in the Company post-Closing will be different. These ownership percentages with respect to the Company following the Business Combination do not take into account: (i) the 3,018,750 public warrants to purchase up to a total of 3,018,750 Company common shares, (ii) the 216,031 private warrants to purchase up to a total of 216,031 Company common shares, (iii) the unit purchase option, held by the underwriter in our IPO, to purchase up to 157,500 Company common shares, 157,500 rights to receive 15,750 Company common shares, and 78,750 public warrants to purchase up to a total of 78,750 Company common shares that will remain outstanding following the Business Combination, (iv) the issuance of any Company common shares under the Assumed Options upon the Closing, or (v) any adjustments to the number of the Closing Consideration Shares that will be issued to the Xynomic stockholders. If the actual facts are different than these assumptions (which they are likely to be), the percentage ownership retained by Bison\u2019s existing shareholders in Bison will be different.\nOur ability to successfully effect the Business Combination and successfully operate the business thereafter will be largely dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel, including the key personnel of Xynomic, all of whom we expect to stay with Xynomic following the Business Combination. The loss of such key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of the post-combination business.\nOur ability to successfully effect the Business Combination and successfully operate the business is dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel, including the key personnel of Xynomic. Although we expect all of such key personnel to remain with Xynomic following the Business Combination, it is possible that we will lose some key personnel, the loss of which could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. Furthermore, while we have scrutinized individuals we intend to engage to stay with Xynomic following the Business Combination, our assessment of these individuals may not prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.\nA market for our securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nFollowing the Business Combination, the price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction to the Business Combination, the business of Xynomic and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities following the Business Combination may never develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities after the Business Combination can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition, and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nOur Initial Shareholders and/or their affiliates may enter into agreements concerning our securities prior to the Meeting, which may have the effect of increasing the likelihood of the Closing, decreasing the value of our shares, or reducing the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our shares.\nAt any time prior to the Meeting, during a period when they are not then aware of any material nonpublic information regarding the Company or its securities, the initial shareholders and/or their affiliates may enter into a written plan to purchase the Company\u2019s securities pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, and may engage in other public market purchases, as well as private purchases, of securities. In addition, at any time prior to the Meeting, during a period when they are not then aware of any material nonpublic information regarding the Company or its securities, the initial shareholders and/or their respective affiliates may (i) purchase shares from institutional and other investors who vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against the Business Combination Proposal, (ii) execute agreements to purchase such shares from institutional and other investors in the future, and/or (iii) enter into transactions with institutional and other investors to provide such persons with incentives to acquire shares of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares or vote their shares in favor of the Business Combination Proposal. Such an agreement may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our initial shareholders or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling public shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. While the exact nature of any such incentives has not been determined as of the date of this Form 10-K, they might include, without limitation, arrangements to protect such investors or holders against potential loss in value of their shares, including the granting of put options and the transfer of shares or warrants owned by the initial shareholders for nominal value to such investors or holders.\nThe purpose of such share purchases and other transactions by the initial shareholders and/or their respective affiliates would be to increase the likelihood of satisfaction of the requirements that (x) the holders of a majority of the public shares present and entitled to vote at the Meeting vote in favor of the Business Combination Proposal, and/or (y) that the Company will have at least $7,500,000 in net tangible assets upon the Closing after taking into account holders of public shares that properly demanded redemption of their public shares into cash, when, in each case, it appears that such requirements would otherwise not be met.\nEntering into any such arrangements may have a depressive effect on the Company\u2019s shares. For example, as a result of these arrangements, an investor or holder may have the ability to effectively purchase shares at a price lower than market and may therefore be more likely to sell the shares it owns, either prior to or immediately after the Meeting. In addition, if such arrangements are made, the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our shares and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing, or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, there have been no such discussions and no agreements to such effect have been entered into with any such investor or holder. The Company will file a Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose arrangements entered into or significant purchases made by any of the aforementioned persons that would affect the vote on the Business Combination Proposal and the Charter Amendment Proposal or the redemption threshold. Any such report will include descriptions of any arrangements entered into or significant purchases by any of the aforementioned persons.\nAlthough we expect our shares and warrants to remain listed on Nasdaq after the Business Combination, there can be no assurance that our shares and warrants will continue to be so listed or, if listed, that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq.\nWe have applied to continue listing our securities on Nasdaq subsequent to the Closing. To continue listing our securities on Nasdaq subsequent to the Closing, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s initial listing standards, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements. For instance, we must maintain a minimum number of holders (300 round-lot holders). We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing standards at that time.\nIf, after the Business Combination, Nasdaq delists our shares or warrants from trading on its exchange due to our failure to meet Nasdaq\u2019s initial and/or continued listing standards, we and our shareholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our shares are \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares;\n\u25cf a limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nPursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Following the Business Combination, the combined company will continue to be required to provide management\u2019s attestation on internal controls effective with respect to the year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with applicable SEC guidance.\nHowever, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following June 23, 2022, the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (c) our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period exceeds $1 billion, or (d) if the market value of our shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen not to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Such circumstances could adversely affect the value and liquidity of our securities.\nIf the Business Combination\u2019s benefits do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders, or financial analysts, the market price of our securities may decline.\nIf the benefits of the Business Combination do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of the Company\u2019s securities prior to the Closing may decline. The market values of our securities at the time of the Business Combination may vary significantly from their prices on the date the Merger Agreement was executed, the date of this Form 10-K, or the date on which our shareholders vote on the Business Combination.\nIn addition, following the Business Combination, fluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Prior to the Business Combination, there has not been a public market for Xynomic\u2019s stock and trading in the shares of the Company\u2019s shares has not been active. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to Xynomic and our shares in the Business Combination may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following the Business Combination. If an active market for our securities develops and continues, the trading price of our securities following the Business Combination could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities following the Business Combination may include:\n\u25cf our research and development and our ability to commercialize our products;\n\u25cf our ability to attract, retain scientists, senior management, or key operating personnel;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf changes in government regulations;\n\u25cf the announcement of acquisitions by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in general economic and political conditions;\n\u25cf volatility in the financial markets;\n\u25cf results of our operations and the operations of others in our industry;\n\u25cf changes in interest rates;\n\u25cf threatened or actual litigation and government investigations;\n\u25cf the addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf actions taken by our shareholders, including the sale or disposition of their shares; and\n\u25cf differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts and changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and Nasdaq in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the Company could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions, or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, further adversely affecting our business, financial condition, or prospects.\nFollowing the Business Combination, the Company\u2019s business and stock price may suffer as a result of its lack of public company operating experience and if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our shares adversely, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nPrior to the completion of the Business Combination, we have been a blank check company. The Company\u2019s lack of public company operating experience may make it difficult to forecast and evaluate its future prospects. If the Company is unable to execute its business strategy, either as a result of its inability to effectively manage its business in a public company environment or for any other reason, the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed.\nThe trading market for our shares will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on the Company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, our stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover the Company change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our shares would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover the Company were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on it, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe combined company\u2019s common stock will be subject to registration rights agreements. Sales of restricted securities pursuant to these agreements may substantially depress the market price of its common stock. Bison, Xynomic, and the Xynomic stockholders will enter into a registration rights agreement that provides for the registration of the Company common shares that we will issue to Xynomic stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The combined company will also be obligated to register Founder Shares, insider units (including any units issuable upon conversion of the $500,000 Sponsor note), and the Company common shares and warrants included in the insider units (or issuable under the rights or upon exercise of the warrants) pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed in connection with Bison\u2019s IPO.\nWarrants will become exercisable for our Company common shares, which would increase the number of Company common shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOutstanding public warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,018,750 Company common shares and outstanding private warrants to purchase an aggregate of 216,031 Company common shares will become exercisable commencing 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Bison\u2019s Company common shares at a price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustments. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of Bison\u2019s Company common shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then existing holders of Company common shares and increase the number of Company common shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may redeem any public warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making their warrants worthless.\nWe will have the ability to redeem the public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sale price of the Company common shares equals or exceeds $24.00 per share for any 20 trading days within the 30 trading-day period ending on the third business day before we send the notice of such redemption and if there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the Company common shares underlying such warrants at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption. Redemption of the outstanding public warrants could force holders of public warrants:\n\u25cf to exercise their warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for them to do so;\n\u25cf to sell their warrants at the then-current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold their warrants; or\n\u25cf to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of their warrants.\nWe may issue additional Company common shares to complete the business combination or under the Xynomic 2018 Equity Incentive Plan after consummation of our initial business combination, which would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.\nOur Current Charter authorize the issuance of an unlimited amount of both common stock of no par value and preferred stock of no par value and our Interim Charter will authorize the issuance of 200 million shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. We may issue a substantial number of additional Company common stock or preferred stock to complete our initial business combination or after consummation of our initial business combination. Although no such issuance of Company common stock or preferred stock will affect the per share amount available for redemption from the trust account, the issuance of additional Company common stock or preferred stock:\n\u25cf may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in the IPO, who will not have pre-emption rights in respect of such an issuance;\n\u25cf could cause a change in control if a substantial number of stocks are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u25cf may adversely affect prevailing market prices for stocks and/or warrants.\nOur Current Charter permit the board of directors by resolution to amend our Current Charter, including to create additional classes of securities, including shares with rights, preferences, designations, and limitations as they determine which may have an anti-takeover effect.\nOur Current Charter permits the board of directors by resolution to amend Current Charter including to designate rights, preferences, designations, and limitations attaching to the preferred shares as they determine in their discretion, without shareholder approval with respect the terms or the issuance. If issued, the rights, preferences, designations, and limitations of the preferred shares would be set by the board of directors and could operate to the disadvantage of the outstanding shares the holders of which would not have any pre-emption rights in respect of such an issuance of preferred shares. Such terms could include, among others, preferences as to dividends and distributions on liquidation, or could be used to prevent possible corporate takeovers. We may issue some or all of such preferred shares in connection with our initial business combination that would affect the substance or timing of our redemption obligation if we do not consummate a business combination within the relevant time period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders (and/or our Sponsor\u2019s designees), and our directors and officers have agreed to not propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to our Current Charter that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem all public shares if we cannot complete an initial business combination within 21 months of the closing of the IPO, unless the Company provides public shareholders an opportunity to redeem their public shares.\nIf we are unable to effect the Business Combination and fail to complete an alternative initial business combination by March 23, 2019 (subject to potential extension), we will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming 100% of the outstanding public shares and, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolving and liquidating. In such event, the warrants and rights will expire worthless and third parties may bring claims against Bison and, as a result, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per share liquidation price received by shareholders could be less than $10.25 per share. Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders.\nIf we do not consummate the Business Combination and fail to complete an alternative initial business combination by March 23, 2019 (which will be extended to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by Bison\u2019s board of directors upon receipt of Bison\u2019s shareholders\u2019 approval of the Extension Proposal), the Current Charter provides that we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter (subject to our Current Charter and the laws of the British Virgin Islands), redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares (including any public units in this offering or any public units or shares that our initial shareholders or their affiliates purchased in this offering or later acquired in the open market or in private transactions) which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders\u2019 rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of shares and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the company, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. Holders of our Founder Shares have waived any right to any liquidation distribution with respect to those shares. In the event of liquidation, there will be no distribution with respect to our outstanding warrants and rights. Accordingly, the warrants and rights will expire worthless.\nIn addition, third parties may bring claims against Bison. Although Bison has obtained waiver agreements from certain vendors and service providers it has engaged and owes money to, and the prospective target businesses it has negotiated with, whereby such parties have waived any right, title, interest, or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they or other vendors who did not execute such waivers will not seek recourse against the trust account notwithstanding such agreements. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a court will uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to claims which could take priority over those of Bison\u2019s public shareholders. If Bison is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, our Sponsor has agreed to be personally liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by Bison for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to Bison, but only if such a vendor or prospective target business has not executed such a waiver of claims against the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity to the underwriters. However, he may not be able to meet such obligation. Therefore, the per-share distribution from the trust account in such a situation may be less than $10.25 due to such claims.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.25 per share or (ii) other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver such lesser amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy his obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.25 per share.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional, and local governments, including non-U.S. governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming, and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments, and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their departure could adversely affect our ability to complete the Business Combination.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and directors, at least until we have completed the Business Combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including assessing the potential Business Combination and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not currently have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could adversely impact our ability to complete the Business Combination.\nSince our Sponsor, executive officers, and directors will lose their entire investment in us if the Business Combination is not completed, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether Xynomic is appropriate for our initial business combination.\nIn December 2016, our initial shareholders purchased an aggregate of 1,437,500 Founder Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.017 per share. On June 19, 2017, the number of Founder Shares issued under the original subscription agreement was increased by way of the sub-division of each of the then existing Founder Shares on a 1.05 for 1 basis, resulting in the total number of Founder Shares becoming 1,509,375. The Founder Shares will be worthless if we do not consummate an initial business combination. In addition, our Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital purchased an aggregate of 432,062 private units, each consisting of one Company common share, one right, each to receive one-tenth of one Company common share upon consummation of our initial business combination, and one half of one warrant, each whole warrant to purchase one Company common share, for an aggregate purchase price of $4,320,625 that will also be worthless if we do not consummate our initial business combination. The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may have influenced their motivation in identifying and selecting Xynomic for its target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination.\nSince our Sponsor, executive officers, and directors will not be eligible to be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses if the Business Combination is not completed, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether Xynomic is appropriate for our initial business combination.\nAt the Closing, our Sponsor, executive officers, directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf. These financial interests of our Sponsor, executive officers, and directors may have influenced their motivation in identifying and selecting Xynomic for the Business Combination.\nWe will be a holding company and will conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries.\nUpon consummation of the Business Combination, we will be a holding company and will derive all of our operating income from subsidiaries of Xynomic. Other than any cash we may retain, all of our assets will be held by our direct and indirect subsidiaries. We will rely on the earnings and cash flows of Xynomic, which will be paid to us by our subsidiaries, if and only to the extent available, in the form of dividends and other payments or distributions, to meet our debt service obligations. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their jurisdiction of organization (which may limit the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends and other distributions to us), the terms of existing and future indebtedness and other agreements of our subsidiaries and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur.\nWe are attempting to consummate the Business Combination with a private company about which little information is available.\nIn pursuing our acquisition strategy, we have effectuated our initial business combination with a privately held company. By definition, very little public information exists about private companies, and we were required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in our initial business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\nIf we are deemed to be insolvent, distributions, or part of them, may be delayed while the insolvency liquidator determines the extent of potential creditor claims. In these circumstances, prior payments made by Bison may be deemed \u201cvoidable transactions.\u201d\nIf we do not complete our initial business combination by March 23, 2019 (which will be extended to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by Bison\u2019s board of directors upon receipt of Bison\u2019s shareholders\u2019 approval of the Extension Proposal) (unless such date is accelerated, in the board\u2019s discretion, or further extended), this will trigger an automatic redemption of public shareholders from the trust account pursuant to our Current Charter.\nIf at any time, however, we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act (i.e., (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under Section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree, or order of a British Virgin Islands Court in favor of a creditor of us is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of our liabilities exceeds its assets, or we are unable to pay our debts as they fall due), we are required to immediately enter insolvent liquidation. In these circumstances, a liquidator will be appointed who will give notice to our creditors, inviting them to submit their claims for payments, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where we have its principal place of business, and taking any other steps he considers appropriate, after which our assets would be distributed. Following the process of insolvent liquidation, the liquidator will complete its final report and accounts and will then notify the Registrar of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands. The liquidator may determine that he requires additional time to evaluate creditors\u2019 claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). In addition, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the British Virgin Islands Court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our assets to our public shareholders. In such liquidation proceedings, the funds held in our trust account may be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any such claims deplete the trust account we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public shareholders the amounts otherwise payable to them.\nIf we are deemed insolvent, then there are also limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed a \u201cvoidable transaction\u201d for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would be, for these purposes, payments made as \u201cunfair preferences\u201d or \u201ctransactions at an undervalue.\u201d Where a payment was a risk of being a voidable transaction, a liquidator appointed over an insolvent company could apply to the British Virgin Islands Court for an order, inter alia, for the transaction to be set aside as a voidable transaction in whole or in part.\nOur Initial Shareholders have waived their right to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the initial shares. We will pay the costs of our liquidation and distribution of the trust account from our remaining assets outside of the trust account and may request the trustee to release to us any net interest earned on the trust account to pay dissolution expenses. In addition, our Sponsor has agreed that he will be liable to us, for all claims of creditors to the extent that we fail to obtain executed waivers from such entities in order to protect the amounts held in trust, except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we cannot assure you that the liquidator will not determine that he or she requires additional time to evaluate creditors\u2019 claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). We also cannot assure you that a creditor or shareholder will not file a petition with the British Virgin Islands Court, which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our assets to our public shareholders.\nWe believe we have been considered a PFIC since our inception (until we domesticate to Delaware), which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. taxpayers.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder (as defined below) of our ordinary shares, warrants, or rights, the U.S. Holder may be subject to increased U.S. federal income tax liability and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. Specifically such U.S. Holder may be subject to tax at ordinary income rates on (i) any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of its ordinary shares, rights, or warrants and (ii) any \u201cexcess distribution\u201d (as defined in \u201cThe Business Combination Proposal-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Shareholders Exercising Redemption Rights\u201d below) received by the U.S. Holder. In addition, such U.S. Holder may be subject to an interest charge on such gain or excess distribution. Consequently, our classification as a PFIC may result in adverse tax consequences for U.S. Holders. We believe that we have been considered a PFIC since our inception.\nOur actual PFIC status for our 2018 taxable year, however, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year, which will occur upon the Domestication.\nSome elections may be available to mitigate the adverse PFIC tax consequences. However, we may not provide timely financial information that would be required for U.S. investors to make such potentially favorable qualified electing fund (\u201cQEF\u201d) election, and such election would be unavailable with respect to our warrants and possibly our rights. Any holder of warrants could therefore be required to recognize gain as ordinary income and subject to an interest charge. Further, because the shareholder\u2019s holding period in the stock received upon the exercise of the warrants includes the holding period in the warrants, a QEF election made on the stock would not rid the stock of its PFIC taint absent the shareholder recognizing gain or including a deemed dividend amount in a purging election. For more information, see the discussion in \u201cThe Business Combination Proposal-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Shareholders Exercising Redemption Rights.\u201d We urge U.S. investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules.\nThe Domestication may result in adverse tax consequences for you.\nUpon the effectiveness of the Domestication, Bison will become a domestic corporation for federal income tax purposes as a result of the Domestication. If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Domestication\u201d below) of Bison ordinary shares, you may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a result of the Domestication unless you made a timely election on your filing with the IRS as described below.\nIf you are a non-U.S. Holder (as defined in \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Domestication\u201d below) of Bison ordinary shares, you may become subject to withholding tax on any dividends paid on the ordinary shares of Bison or the Company common stock subsequent to the Domestication.\nSubject to the discussion below concerning PFICs, if you are a U.S. Holder who owns $50,000 or more of Bison ordinary shares, but are not a 10% Shareholder at the time when Bison becomes taxable as a domestic corporation, you must generally recognize gain (but not loss) with respect to such Company common stock after the Domestication, even if you continue to hold your stock and have not received any cash as a result of the Domestication. As an alternative to recognizing gain under Section 367 of the Code, however, such U.S. Holder may elect to include in income the \u201call earnings and profits amount,\u201d as the term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(b)-2(d), attributable to its ordinary shares in Bison. The income so included pursuant to this election generally is treated as dividend income.\nWE STRONGLY URGE EACH SUCH U.S. HOLDER TO READ CAREFULLY OUR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE ELECTION IN \u201cMATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE DOMESTICATION,\u201d AS WELL AS TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE ELECTIONS AND DOMESTICATION TO YOU.\nIf a U.S. Holder is a 10% Shareholder of Bison, such U.S. Holder will be required to pay taxes on a deemed dividend equal to the \u201call earnings and profits amount\u201d attributable to its ordinary shares in Bison. Complex attribution rules apply in determining whether a U.S. holder owns 10% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our shares for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nThe Company believes that it has been considered a PFIC since its inception. If the Company is considered a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the proposed Treasury Regulations generally require U.S. Holders of Bison ordinary shares to recognize gain on the deemed receipt of Company common stock in the Domestication unless such U.S. Holder has made certain tax elections with respect to such U.S. Holder\u2019s Bison ordinary shares. The tax on any such gain would be imposed at the rate applicable to ordinary income and an interest charge would apply based on complex rules designed to offset the tax deferral to such U.S. Holder on the undistributed earnings, if any, of the Company. It is not possible to determine at this time whether, in what form, and with what effective date, final Treasury Regulations under Section 1291(f) will be adopted.\nFor a more detailed description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences associated with the Domestication, please read \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Domestication\u201d of this proxy.\nThe foreign subsidiaries of the combined entity may qualify as a controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d), which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to the combined entity.\nUnder the CFC rules, a 10% Shareholder generally must include annually as ordinary income its pro rata share of its CFC\u2019s \u201csubpart F income\u201d and \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income,\u201d even if no distributions are made by the foreign subsidiaries to the combined entity. Therefore, the combined entity must generally include annually as ordinary income its foreign subsidiaries\u2019 \u201csubpart F income\u201d and \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income,\u201d even if no distributions are made by the foreign subsidiaries to the combined entity, causing adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to the combined entity. We urge U.S. investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the CFC rules.\nXynomic may have been, and may become, subject to income tax (or an increased amount of income tax) in one or more countries, including the United States, which could materially reduce the combined entity\u2019s after-tax returns and the value of Company common shares.\nAll or a portion of the income of Xynomic\u2019s foreign subsidiaries may be treated in the United States as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Whether Xynomic\u2019s foreign subsidiaries have been, or will be, subject to tax in the United States is not free from doubt in light of the applicable tax law and guidance regarding activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure you that the IRS will not contend, perhaps successfully, that a Xynomic\u2019s foreign subsidiary is engaged in a trade or business in the United States or is subject to more U.S. income tax than it currently incurs. A foreign corporation deemed to be so engaged would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as branch profits tax, on its income that is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business unless the corporation is entitled to relief under an applicable tax treaty.\nThe combined company could become subject to income tax in one or more countries, including the United States, as a result of activities performed by it, adverse developments or changes in law, contrary conclusions by the relevant tax authorities or other causes. The imposition of any of these income taxes could materially reduce the combined company\u2019s post-tax returns available for distributions on, and consequently the value of, Company common shares.\nAn investor may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences in the event the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) were to disagree with the U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein.\nWe have not sought a ruling from the IRS as to any U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein. The IRS may disagree with the descriptions of U.S. federal income tax consequences contained herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Any such determination could subject an investor or our company to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences that would be different than those described herein. Accordingly, each prospective investor is urged to consult a tax advisor with respect to the specific tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares, rights, and warrants, including the applicability and effect of state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws, as well as U.S. federal tax laws.\nCurrently, we are governed by British Virgin Islands law but upon effectiveness of the Domestication, we will be governed by Delaware law, which has anti-takeover implications.\nUpon effectiveness of the Domestication, our organizational documents will change and we and our organizational documents will be governed by Delaware law rather than British Virgin Islands law. The application of Delaware law to us as a result of the Domestication may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts or a change in control. Section 203 of the DGCL restricts certain \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d with \u201cinterested shareholders\u201d for three years following the date that a person becomes an interested shareholder unless: (1) the \u201cbusiness combination\u201d or the transaction which caused the person or entity to become an interested shareholder is approved by the board of directors prior to such business combination or transactions; (2) upon the completion of the transaction in which the person or entity becomes an \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d such interested shareholder holds at least 85% of the voting stock of Bison not including (x) shares held by officers and directors and (y) shares held by employee benefit plans under certain circumstances; or (3) at or after the person or entity becomes an \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d the \u201cbusiness combination\u201d is approved by the board of directors and holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock, excluding shares held by such interested shareholder. A Delaware corporation may elect not to be governed by Section 203. Bison has not made such an election.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Redemption\nWe do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete a Business Combination with which a substantial majority of our shareholders do not agree.\nThough our Current Charter and our Interim Charter has the restriction that a public shareholder, together with any of his, her, or its affiliates or any other person with whom it is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming in the aggregate his, her, or its shares or, if part of such a group, the group\u2019s shares, of 20% or more of the outstanding public shares without the Company\u2019s prior written consent, it does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that we will not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (such that we are not subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules). This condition effectively requires that holders of no more than 5,501,868 shares as of December 31, 2018, redeem their public shares. Accordingly, holders of no more than 5,501,868 of the 6,037,500 public shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018 may redeem their shares in connection with the Business Combination if the Business Combination were consummated as of that date. As a result, we may be able to consummate the Business Combination even though holders of a substantial majority of our public shares have chosen to redeem their shares.\nIf you or a \u201cgroup\u201d of shareholders of which you are a part are deemed to hold an aggregate of 20.0% or more of our ordinary shares issued in the IPO, you (or, if a member of such a group, all of the members of such group in the aggregate) will lose the ability to redeem all such shares of 20.0% or more of our ordinary shares issued in the IPO unless otherwise consented by us.\nA public shareholder, together with any of his, her, or its affiliates or any other person with whom it is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming in the aggregate his, her, or its shares or, if part of such a group, the group\u2019s shares, of 20% or more of the outstanding shares issued in the IPO without our prior written consent. We refer to such shares aggregating 20% or more of the shares issued in the IPO as \u201cExcess Shares.\u201d In order to determine whether a shareholder is acting in concert or as a group with another shareholder, the Company will require each public shareholder seeking to exercise redemption rights to certify to the Company whether such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group with any other shareholder. Such certifications, together with other public information relating to stock ownership available to the Company at that time, such as Section 13D, Section 13G, and Section 16 filings under the Exchange Act, will be the sole basis on which the Company makes the above-referenced determination. A public shareholder\u2019s inability to redeem any Excess Shares will reduce that shareholder\u2019s influence over our ability to consummate the Business Combination. A shareholder could suffer a material loss on its investment in us if it sold Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, a shareholder will not receive redemption distributions with respect to its Excess Shares if we consummate the Business Combination. As a result, any such shareholder will continue to hold that number of shares equal to its Excess Shares and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell its stock in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shareholders may challenge the Company\u2019s determination as to whether a shareholder is acting in concert or as a group with another shareholder in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nThere is no guarantee that a shareholder\u2019s decision whether to redeem its shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account will put the shareholder in a better future economic position.\nWe can give no assurance as to the price at which a shareholder may be able to sell its public shares in the future following the completion of the Business Combination or any alternative business combination. Certain events following the consummation of any business combination, including the Business Combination, may cause an increase in our common stock price, and may result in a lower value realized now than a shareholder of Bison might realize in the future had the shareholder not elected to redeem such shareholder\u2019s shares. Similarly, if a shareholder does not redeem its shares, the shareholder will bear the risk of ownership of the public shares after the consummation of any business combination, and there can be no assurance that a shareholder can sell its shares in the future for a greater amount than the redemption price set forth in this Form 10-K. A shareholder should consult the shareholder\u2019s own tax and/or financial advisor for assistance on how this may affect his, her or its individual situation.\nIf our shareholders fail to comply with the redemption requirements specified in this Form 10-K, they will not be entitled to redeem their ordinary shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in our trust account.\nHolders of public shares are required to submit a request in writing and deliver their stock (either physically or electronically) to our transfer agent at least two business days prior to the Meeting. Shareholders electing to redeem their shares will receive their pro rata portion of the trust account less franchise and income taxes payable, calculated as of two business days prior to the anticipated the Closing.\nIf you are a non-U.S. Holder, you may be subject to U.S. withholding tax on the redemption.\nBison shareholders who exercise their redemption rights to receive cash from the trust account in exchange for their Bison ordinary shares generally will be required to treat the transaction as a sale of such shares. The redemption, however, may be treated as a distribution if it does not effect a meaningful reduction in the redeeming shareholder\u2019s percentage ownership in Bison. It is important to note that the Section 318 of the Code attribution or constructive ownership of stock rules apply when testing redemption treatment under Section 302(b). If there is attribution sufficient to cause the redemption to be treated instead under the Section 301 distribution rules which breaks non-liquidating corporate distributions into a dividend (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits), a non-taxable return of capital, and any remaining portion treated as a gain from the sale of Bison ordinary shares. If you are a non-U.S. Holder, you may be subject to withholding tax on any part of the redemption treated as a dividend, which may include the full amount of the redemption\nRisks Related to Xynomic\nRisks Related to Xynomic\u2019s Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nXynomic is a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and has not yet generated any revenue from product sales. Xynomic has incurred operating losses since its inception and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nXynomic is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a drug candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. Xynomic commenced operations in August 2016. Its operations to date have been limited primarily to organizing and staffing the company, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing drug candidates, undertaking pre-clinical studies, and clinically developing drug candidates. Xynomic has never generated any revenue from drug sales, and has not obtained regulatory approvals for any of its drug candidates. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Xynomic reported a net loss of $5.5 million.\nXynomic expects to incur significantly higher expenses and operating losses over the next several years in connection with its ongoing activities, as Xynomic:\n\u25cf continues pre-clinical and clinical development of its programs;\n\u25cf in-licenses and subsequently develops additional oncology drug candidates;\n\u25cf continues to discover, validate and develop additional drug candidates;\n\u25cf maintains, expands and protects Xynomic\u2019s intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf hires additional research, development and business personnel;\n\u25cf incurs costs associated with filing marketing authorization applications;\n\u25cf if abexinostat is successfully approved for commercialization, incurs additional costs associated with establishing sales and marketing infrastructure for abexinostat in U.S., China and other territories; and\n\u25cf incurs additional costs associated with operating as a public company upon the Closing.\nTo become and remain profitable, Xynomic must develop and eventually commercialize drug candidates with significant market potential. This will require it to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of its drug candidates, obtaining marketing approval for these drug candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those drug candidates for which it may obtain marketing approval, and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. It may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if it does, Xynomic may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. It may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect its business. The size of Xynomic\u2019s future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of its expenses and its ability to generate revenue. Even if it achieves profitability in the future, it may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nRisks Related to Xynomic\u2019s Business\nAll of Xynomic\u2019s drug candidates are still in development. If Xynomic is unable to obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize its drug candidates or experiences significant delays in doing so, its business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nAll of Xynomic\u2019s drug candidates are still in development. One of its drug candidates is in clinical development and various others are in pre-clinical development. Xynomic\u2019s ability to generate revenues from its drug candidates is dependent on its receipt of regulatory approval and successfully commercializing such products, which may never occur. Each of Xynomic\u2019s drug candidates will require additional pre-clinical and/or clinical development, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, development of manufacturing supply and capacity, substantial investment, and significant marketing efforts before it generates any revenue from product sales. The success of Xynomic\u2019s drug candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u25cf successful completion of pre-clinical and/or clinical studies;\n\u25cf successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;\n\u25cf receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities for planned clinical trials, future clinical trials, or drug registrations, manufacturing, and commercialization;\n\u25cf successful completion of all safety studies required to obtain regulatory approval in China, the United States, and other jurisdictions for its drug candidates;\n\u25cf developing commercial manufacturing capabilities to the specifications for Xynomic\u2019s drug candidates for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing;\n\u25cf making and maintaining arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property protection and/or regulatory exclusivity for Xynomic\u2019s drug candidates;\n\u25cf launching commercial sales of Xynomic\u2019s drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u25cf acceptance of the drug candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;\n\u25cf effectively competing with other therapies and alternative drugs;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u25cf successfully enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims; and\n\u25cf maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the drug candidates following regulatory approval.\nThe success of Xynomic\u2019s business is dependent upon its ability to develop and commercialize its clinical-stage drug candidates, particularly abexinostat, which has three clinical trials currently on-going As a result, Xynomic\u2019s business is substantially dependent on its ability to complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize abexinostat and its other drug candidates in a timely manner.\nXynomic cannot commercialize drug candidates in the United States or another jurisdiction outside of China without obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Similarly, Xynomic cannot commercialize drug candidates in China without first obtaining regulatory approval from the NMPA. The process to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize drug candidates is long, complex, and costly and approval may not be granted. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and obtaining regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Even if Xynomic\u2019s drug candidates were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, Xynomic would still need to seek approval in China and any other jurisdictions where it plans to market the product. Any safety issues, product recalls, or other incidents related to products approved and marketed in one jurisdictions may impact approval of those products by another jurisdiction. If Xynomic is unable to obtain regulatory approval for its drug candidates in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations imposed on certain drug candidates, it may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of its drug candidates or any other drug candidate that Xynomic may in-license, acquire, or develop in the future.\nXynomic may be unable to obtain regulatory approval under applicable regulatory requirements.\nTo gain approval to market a drug product, regardless of whether it is through Accelerated Approval or the conventional pathway, Xynomic must provide the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies with clinical data that adequately demonstrates the safety and efficacy of the product for the intended indication applied for in the New Drug Application, or \u201cNDA,\u201d or other respective regulatory filing. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of any of our clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials even after promising results in earlier nonclinical or clinical studies and trials. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported Adverse Events (\u201cAEs\u201d). Success in nonclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we may conduct.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. Failure can occur at any stage of clinical development.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of nonclinical and clinical studies and trials of Xynomic\u2019s drug candidate may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical and clinical studies and trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies and trials, and Xynomic cannot be certain that it will not face similar setbacks. Based upon negative or inconclusive results, Xynomic or any potential future collaborator may decide, or regulators may require Xynomic, to conduct additional nonclinical and clinical studies and trials. In addition, data obtained from trials and studies are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret Xynomic\u2019s data as favorably as it does, which may delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. Furthermore, Xynomic relies on contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of its clinical trials and, while Xynomic has agreements governing their committed activities, it has limited influence over their actual performance.\nIn addition, Xynomic does not know whether future clinical trials, if any, will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed or aborted for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure to:\n\u25cf obtain regulatory approval to commence a trial, if applicable;\n\u25cf reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf obtain ethics committee or institutional review board, or \u201cIRB,\u201d approval at each site;\n\u25cf recruit suitable patients to participate in a trial and have such patients complete the clinical trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf ensure that clinical sites follow the trial protocol, comply with Good Clinical Practice, or \u201cGCP,\u201d and continue to participate in a clinical trial;\n\u25cf address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a clinical trial;\n\u25cf ensure that patients comply with and complete clinical trial protocol;\n\u25cf achieve a sufficient level of endpoint events in the placebo group, if applicable;\n\u25cf initiate or add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf ensure that trial sites do not deviate from clinical trial protocol or drop out of a clinical trial;\n\u25cf address any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u25cf manufacture sufficient quantities of drug candidate for use in clinical trials and ensure clinical trial material is provided to clinical sites in a timely manner; and\n\u25cf obtain the statistical analysis plan to be used to evaluate the clinical trial data.\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications Xynomic is investigating.\nXynomic could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by it, by the ethics committees or IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by an independent Safety Review Board, for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Such parties may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or Xynomic\u2019s clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory agencies resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nFurther, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries presents additional risks that may delay completion of Xynomic\u2019s clinical trials. These risks include the failure of physicians or enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries. In addition, the FDA may determine that clinical trial results obtained in foreign subjects do not represent the safety and efficacy of a product when administered in U.S. patients and are thus not supportive of an NDA approval in the United States.\nIf Xynomic experiences delays in the start or completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of its drug candidates, the commercial prospects of its drug candidates may be harmed, and Xynomic\u2019s ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing its clinical trials will increase Xynomic\u2019s costs, slow down its drug candidates\u2019 development and approval process and jeopardize Xynomic\u2019s ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm Xynomic\u2019s business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of its drug candidates.\nIf Xynomic encounters difficulties enrolling patients in its clinical trials, its clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nXynomic commenced three clinical trials involving abexinostat and timely completion of those clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on its ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who meet the trial criteria and remain in the trial until its conclusion. Xynomic may experience difficulties enrolling and retaining appropriate patients in its clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf the size and nature of the patient population;\n\u25cf patient eligibility criteria defined in the clinical protocol;\n\u25cf the size of study population required for statistical analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u25cf the proximity of patients to trial sites;\n\u25cf the design of the trial and changes to the design of the trial;\n\u25cf Xynomic\u2019s ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u25cf competing clinical trials for similar therapies or other new therapeutics, which will reduce the number and types of patients available;\n\u25cf clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and side effects of the drug candidates being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drug candidates or treatments that may be approved for the indications Xynomic is investigating;\n\u25cf Xynomic\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u25cf patients enrolled in clinical trials that may not complete a clinical trial; and\n\u25cf the availability of approved therapies that are similar to Xynomic\u2019s drug candidates.\nEven if Xynomic is able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in its clinical trials, delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect its ability to advance the development of Xynomic\u2019s drug candidates.\nXynomic faces substantial competition, which may result in its competitors discovering, developing, or commercializing drugs before or more successfully than Xynomic does, or develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than those of Xynomic.\nThe development and commercialization of new drugs are highly competitive. Xynomic faces competition with respect to its current drug candidates, and will face competition with respect to any drug candidates that it may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. For example, there are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are currently marketing drugs or are pursuing the development of therapies in the field of HDAC inhibition to treat cancer. Some of these competitive drugs and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to that of Xynomic\u2019s drug candidates. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization.\nSpecifically, there are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer. If abexinostat receives marketing approval for renal cell carcinoma (\u201cRCC\u201d), follicular lymphoma (\u201cFL\u201d), and/or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (\u201cDLBCL\u201d), it may face competition from approved drugs marketed by Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, and Pfizer Inc. If XP-102 receives marketing approval for patients with colorectal cancer or melanoma, it will face competition from Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Roche AG, and potentially other companies.\nMany of the companies against which Xynomic is competing or against which it may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved drugs than Xynomic. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of its competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with Xynomic in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, its programs.\nXynomic\u2019s commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, with fewer or less severe side effects, more convenient, or less expensive than drugs that it may develop. Xynomic\u2019s competitors also may obtain FDA, NMPA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than it may obtain approval for its drugs, which could result in Xynomic\u2019s competitors establishing a strong market position before Xynomic is able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by its competitors may render its potential drug candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and Xynomic may not be successful in marketing its drug candidates against competitors.", "PERMNO": 16815, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "XYNO"}
