If we are unable to attract and retain independent associates, our business may suffer.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to attract and retain a large active base of independent associates and members who purchase our packs and products. We cannot give any assurances that the number of our independent associates will continue at their current levels or increase in the future. Several factors affect our ability to attract and retain independent associates and members, including:\n\u00b7 on-going motivation of our independent associates;\n\u00b7 general economic conditions;\n\u00b7 significant changes in the amount of commissions paid;\n\u00b7 public perception and acceptance of the wellness industry;\n\u00b7 public perception and acceptance of network marketing;\n\u00b7 public perception and acceptance of our business and our products, including any negative publicity;\n\u00b7 the limited number of people interested in pursuing network marketing as a business;\n\u00b7 our ability to provide proprietary quality-driven products that the market demands; and\n\u00b7 competition in recruiting and retaining independent associates.\n2. The loss of key high-level independent associate leaders could negatively impact our associate growth and our revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 230,000 active independent associates and members who purchased our products within the last 12 months, of which 137 occupied the highest associate levels under our global compensation plan. These independent associate leaders are important in maintaining and growing our revenue. As a result, the loss of a high-level independent associate or a group of leading associates in the independent associates\u2019 networks of downlines, whether by their own choice or through disciplinary actions by us for violations of our policies and procedures, could negatively impact our associate growth and our revenue.\n3. Changes to our associate compensation arrangements could be viewed negatively by some independent associates, could cause failure to achieve desired long-term results and have a negative impact on revenue.\nOur associate compensation plan includes components that differ from market to market. We modify components of our compensation plan from time to time in an attempt to remain competitive and attractive to existing and potential independent associates including such modifications:\n\u00b7 to address changing market dynamics;\n\u00b7 to provide incentives to independent associates that are intended to help grow our business;\n\u00b7 to conform to local regulations; and\n\u00b7 to address other business needs.\nBecause of the size of our associate force and the complexity of our compensation plans, it is difficult to predict how independent associates will view such changes and whether such changes will achieve their desired results.\n4. An increase in the amount of commissions and incentives paid to independent associates and members reduces our profitability.\nThe payment of commissions and incentives, including bonuses and prizes, is our most significant expense. Together, our commissions and incentives range approximately from 39% to 43% of our consolidated net sales. We closely monitor the amount of commissions and incentives as a percentage of net sales, and may periodically adjust our compensation plan to better manage these costs. There can be no assurance that changes to the compensation plan will be successful in achieving target levels of commissions and incentives as a percentage of net sales and preventing these costs from having a significant adverse effect on our earnings. Furthermore, such changes may make it difficult to attract and retain independent associates or cause us to lose some of our existing independent associates.\n5. The loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the continued services of our executive officers and senior management team as they work closely with independent associate leaders and are responsible for our day-to-day operations. Our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers, to compensate our executive officers at attractive levels, and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain members of our senior management team, and do not believe that any of them are planning to leave or retire in the near term, we cannot assure you that our senior managers will remain with us. The loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers or members of our senior management team, including our regional and country managers, or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or independent associate relations.\n6. If government regulations regarding network marketing change or are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to our business, we may be subject to new enforcement actions and material limitations regarding our overall business model.\nNetwork marketing is always subject to extensive governmental regulations, including foreign, federal, and state regulations. Any change in legislation and regulations could affect our business. Furthermore, significant penalties could be imposed on us for failure to comply with various statutes or regulations. Violations may result from:\n\u00b7 ambiguity in statutes;\n\u00b7 regulations and related court decisions;\n\u00b7 the discretion afforded to regulatory authorities and courts interpreting and enforcing laws; and\n\u00b7 new regulations or interpretations of regulations affecting our business.\n7. Independent associates could fail to comply with our associate policies and procedures or make improper product, compensation, marketing or advertising claims that violate laws or regulations, which could result in claims against us that could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe sell our products worldwide to a sales force of independent associates. The independent associates are independent contractors and, accordingly, we are not in a position to provide the same direction, motivation, and oversight as we would if associates were our own employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that our associates will participate in our marketing strategies or plans, accept our introduction of new products, or comply with our associate policies and procedures. All independent associates sign a written contract and agree to adhere to our policies and procedures, which prohibit associates from making false, misleading or other improper claims regarding products or income potential from the distribution of the products. However, independent associates may from time to time, without our knowledge and in violation of our policies, create promotional materials or otherwise provide information that does not accurately describe our marketing program. There is a possibility that some jurisdictions could seek to hold us responsible for independent associate activities that violate applicable laws or regulations, which could result in government or third party actions or fines against us, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\n8. We may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our independent associates, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur independent associates are subject to taxation and, in some instances, legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes, such as value added taxes, and to maintain appropriate tax records. In addition, we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our distributors. In the event that local laws and regulations require us to treat our independent distributors as employees, or if our distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities to be our employees, rather than independent contractors, we may be held responsible for social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions, plus any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\n9. Challenges by private parties to the form of our network marketing system could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to challenges by private parties, including our independent associates and members, to the form of our network marketing system or elements of our business. In the United States, the network marketing industry and regulatory authorities have relied on the implementation of distributor rules and policies designed to promote retail sales to protect consumers, prevent inappropriate activities, and distinguish between legitimate network marketing distribution plans and unlawful pyramid schemes. We have adopted rules and policies based on case law, rulings of the FTC, discussions with regulatory authorities in several states, and domestic and global industry standards. Legal and regulatory requirements concerning network marketing systems, however, involve a high level of subjectivity, are inherently fact-based, and are subject to judicial interpretation. Because of this, we can provide no assurance that we would not be harmed by the application or interpretation of statutes or regulations governing network marketing, particularly in any civil challenge by a current or former independent associate or member.\n10. If our network marketing activities do not comply with government regulations, our business could suffer.\nMany governmental agencies regulate our network marketing activities. A government agency\u2019s determination that our business or our independent associates have significantly violated a law or regulation could adversely affect our business. The laws and regulations for network marketing intend to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes. Our business faces constant regulatory scrutiny due to the interpretive and enforcement discretion given to regulators, periodic misconduct by our independent associates, adoption of new laws or regulations, and changes in the interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations. For example, in July 2007, the Texas Attorney General filed suit against us, MannaRelief Ministries, Samuel L.Caster, the Fisher Institute, and H. Reginald McDaniel alleging violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Texas Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. We subsequently reached an agreement with the Texas Attorney General\u2019s office settling the enforcement action. Without admitting any wrongdoing, we agreed to refund up to $4 million to certain members and paid $2 million to cover fees and expenses of Texas regulators. We also made certain corporate governance changes required by the Texas Attorney General\u2019s office and have taken a number of actions to address concerns raised by the Texas Attorney General. If we are unable to comply fully with the provisions of the settlement, Texas regulators could pursue further remedies that may impact our business.\nIn addition, in the past, and because of the industry in which we operate, we have experienced inquiries regarding specific independent associates.\n11. If we violate governmental regulations or fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, our operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operation is subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions, and similar constraints at the federal, state, and local levels in our domestic and foreign markets. These regulations primarily involve the following:\n\u00b7 the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale, and storage of our products;\n\u00b7 the health and safety of dietary supplements, cosmetics and foods;\n\u00b7 trade practice laws and network marketing laws;\n\u00b7 our product claims and advertising by our independent associates;\n\u00b7 our network marketing system;\n\u00b7 pricing restrictions regarding transactions with our foreign subsidiaries or other related parties and similar regulations that affect our level of foreign taxable income;\n\u00b7 the assessment of customs duties;\n\u00b7 further taxation of our independent associates, which may obligate us to collect additional taxes and maintain additional records; and\n\u00b7 export and import restrictions.\nAny unexpected new regulations or changes in existing regulations could significantly restrict our ability to continue operations, which could adversely affect our business. For example, changes regarding health and safety and food and drug regulations for our nutritional products could require us to reformulate our products to comply with such regulations.\nIn some foreign countries, nutritional products are considered foods, while other countries consider them drugs. Future health and safety or food and drug regulations could delay or prevent our introduction of new products or suspend or prohibit the sale of existing products in a given country or marketplace. In addition, if we expand into other foreign markets, our operations or products could also be affected by the general stability of such foreign governments and the regulatory environment relating to network marketing and our products. If our products are subject to high customs duties, our sales and competitive position could suffer as compared to locally produced goods. Furthermore, import restrictions in certain countries and jurisdictions could limit our ability to import products from the United States.\n12. Increased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements as well as new regulations that are being adopted in some of our markets with respect to nutritional supplements could result in more restrictive regulations and harm our results if our supplements or advertising activities are found to violate existing or new regulations or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations.\nThere has been an increasing movement in the United States and other markets to increase the regulation of dietary supplements, which could impose additional restrictions or requirements on us and increase the cost of doing business. In several of our markets, new regulations have been adopted, or are likely to be adopted, in the near-term that will impose new requirements, make changes in some classifications of supplements under the regulations, or limit the claims we can make. In addition, there has been increased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements and marketing claims under existing and new regulations. In Europe, for example, we are unable to market supplements that contain ingredients that have not been previously marketed in Europe without going through an extensive registration and approval process. Europe is also expected to adopt additional regulations in the near future to set new limits on acceptable levels of nutrients. South Africa has also implemented new \u201ccomplementary medicine\u201d legislation, which requires a significant dossier in order to register current and new products. If this legislation is carried forward without change, it will likely have a serious, negative impact on our South African sales. The FDA has implemented Good Manufacturing Practices for the U.S. nutritional supplement industry. Our operations could be harmed if new regulations require us to reformulate products or effect new registrations, if regulatory authorities make determinations that any of our products do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, if the cost of complying with regulatory requirements increases materially, or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations. In addition, our operations could be harmed if governmental laws or regulations are enacted that restrict the ability of companies to market or distribute nutritional supplements or impose additional burdens or requirements on nutritional supplement companies.\n13. If we are unable to protect the proprietary rights of our products, our business could suffer.\nOur success and competitive position largely depends on our ability to protect the following proprietary rights:\n\u00b7 our Ambrotose\u00ae complex, a glyconutritional dietary supplement ingredient consisting of a blend of monosaccharides, or sugar molecules, used in the majority of our products;\n\u00b7 the MTech AO Blend\u00ae formulation, our proprietary antioxidant technology used in the Ambrotose AO\u00ae complex; and\n\u00b7 a compound used in our reformulated Advanced Ambrotose\u00ae complex that allows for a more potent concentration of the full range of mannose-containing polysaccharides occurring naturally in aloe.\nWe have filed patent applications for the technology relating to our Ambrotose\u00ae, Ambrotose AO\u00ae, Phytomatrix\u00ae and GI-ProBalance\u00ae\u2122 products in the United States and certain foreign countries. As of December 31, 2014, we had received 51 patents for the technology relating to Ambrotose\u00ae complex, five of which were issued in the United States and the remainder of which were issued in 32 foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our independent associates, suppliers, manufacturers, directors, officers, and consultants to help protect our proprietary rights. Nevertheless, we continue to face the risk that our pending patent applications for our products may not issue or that the patent protection granted is more limited than originally requested. As a precaution, we consult with outside legal counsel and consultants to help ensure that we protect our proprietary rights. However, our business, profitability, and growth prospects could be adversely affected if we fail to receive adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\n14. Our inability to develop and introduce new products that gain independent associate, member, and market acceptance could harm our business.\nA critical component of our business is our ability to develop new products that create enthusiasm among our independent associates and members. If we are unable to introduce new products, our independent associate productivity could be harmed. In addition, if any new products fail to gain market acceptance, are restricted by regulatory requirements or have quality problems, this would harm our results of operations. Factors that could affect our ability to continue to introduce new products include, among others, government regulations, the inability to attract and retain qualified research and development staff, the termination of third-party research and collaborative arrangements, proprietary protections of competitors that may limit our ability to offer comparable products, and the difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences.\n15. Our failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products or product enhancements could significantly harm our relationship with independent associates and members, our product sales, as well as our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences, including rapid and frequent changes in demand for products, new product introductions, and enhancements. Our failure to accurately predict these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of our products, which in turn could harm our independent associate and member relationships and cause the loss of sales. The success of our new product offerings and enhancements depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7 accurately anticipate consumer needs;\n\u00b7 innovate and develop new products or product enhancements that meet these needs;\n\u00b7 successfully commercialize new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u00b7 price our products competitively;\n\u00b7 manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and\n\u00b7 differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.\nIf we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our independent associates, members and customers in a timely manner, some of our products could be rendered obsolete, which could negatively impact our revenues, financial condition, and operating results.\n16. If our outside suppliers and manufacturers fail to supply products in sufficient quantities and in a timely fashion, our business could suffer.\nOutside manufacturers make all of our products. Our profit margins and timely product delivery are dependent upon the ability of our outside suppliers and manufacturers to supply us with products in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Our ability to enter new markets and sustain satisfactory levels of sales in each market depends on the ability of our outside suppliers and manufacturers to provide required levels of ingredients and products and to comply with all applicable regulations. As a precaution, we have approved alternate suppliers and manufacturers for our products. However, the failure of our primary suppliers or manufacturers to supply ingredients or produce our products could adversely affect our business operations.\nWe believe we have dependable suppliers for all of our ingredients and we have identified alternative sources for all of our ingredients, except Arabinogalactan. Due to the unique nature of Arabinogalactan, an important component used in the formulation of our Ambrotose\u00ae complex, we are unable to identify an alternative supplier at this time. If our suppliers are unable to perform, any delay in replacing or substituting such ingredients could affect our business.\n17. The loss of suppliers or shortages of raw materials could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe depend on outside suppliers for raw materials. Our contract manufacturers acquire all of the raw materials for manufacturing our products from third-party suppliers. In the event we were to lose any significant suppliers and have trouble in finding or transitioning to alternative suppliers, it could result in product shortages or product back orders, which could harm our business. There can be no assurance that suppliers will be able to provide our contract manufacturers the raw materials in the quantities and at the appropriate level of quality that we request or at a price that we are willing to pay. We are also subject to delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials including weather, crop conditions, climate change, transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\n18. If we are exposed to product liability claims, we may be liable for damages and expenses, which could affect our overall financial condition.\nWe could face financial liability from product liability claims if the use of our products results in significant loss or injury. We can make no assurances that we will not be exposed to any substantial future product liability claims. Such claims may include claims that our products contain contaminants, that we provide our independent associates and consumers with inadequate instructions regarding product use, or that we provide inadequate warnings concerning side effects or interactions of our products with other substances. We believe that we, our suppliers, and our manufacturers maintain adequate product liability insurance coverage. However, a substantial future product liability claim could exceed the amount of insurance coverage or could be excluded under the terms of an existing insurance policy, which could adversely affect our overall future financial condition.\nIn recent years a discovery of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, (\u201cBSE\u201d), which is commonly referred to as \u201cMad Cow Disease\u201d, has caused concern among the general public. As a result, some countries have banned the importation or sale of products that contain bovine materials sourced from locations where BSE has been identified. We have changed the vast majority of our capsules to a vegetable base. However, if a vegetable base is not available or practical for use, certifications are required to ensure the capsule material is BSE-free. The higher costs could affect our financial condition, results of operations, and our cash flows.\n19. Concentration Risk\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from three product lines: \u016ath TM Skin Rejuvenation, NutiVerus, and our core Ambrotose\u00ae complex products, which include the Ambrotose\u00ae products and Advanced Ambrotose\u00ae products. A decline in sales value of such legacy products could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and financial position. Revenue from these products were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):\nOur business is not currently exposed to customer concentration risk given that no independent associate has ever accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales.\n20. If we incur substantial liability from litigation, complaints, or enforcement actions or incur liabilities or penalties resulting from misconduct by our independent associates, our financial condition could suffer.\nRoutine enforcement actions and complaints are common in our industry. Although we believe we fully cooperate with regulatory agencies and use various means to address misconduct by our independent associates, including maintaining policies and procedures to govern the conduct of our independent associates and conducting training seminars, it is still difficult to detect and correct all instances of misconduct. Violations of our policies and procedures by our independent associates could lead to litigation, formal or informal complaints, enforcement actions, and inquiries by various federal, state, or foreign regulatory authorities against us and/or our independent associates in each country. Because we have expanded into foreign countries, our policies and procedures for our independent associates differ depending on the different legal requirements of each country in which an independent associate does business. Any future litigation, complaints, and enforcement actions involving us and/or our independent associates could consume considerable amounts of financial and other corporate resources, which could have a negative impact on our business, profitability, and growth prospects.\n21. The global nutrition and skin care industries are intensely competitive and the strengthening of any of our competitors could harm our business.\nThe global nutrition and skin care industries are intensely fragmented and competitive. We compete for independent associates with other network marketing companies outside the global nutrition and skin care industries. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition and financial resources, which may give them a competitive advantage. Our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to marketing, promotional, and pricing campaigns that may influence our continuing and potential independent associates and members to buy products from competitors rather than from us. Such competition could adversely affect our business and current market share.\n22. A downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as the health and wellness products that we offer, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer a broad selection of health and wellness products. A downturn in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items such as health and wellness products. In past years, the United States and global economies slowed dramatically as a result of a variety of problems, including turmoil in the credit and financial markets, concerns regarding the stability and viability of major financial institutions, the state of the housing markets, and volatility in worldwide stock markets. In the event of such economic downturn, the U.S. and global economies could become significantly challenged in a recessionary state for an indeterminate period of time. These economic conditions could cause many of our existing and potential associates to delay or reduce purchases of our products for some time, which in turn could harm our business by adversely affecting our revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We cannot predict these economic conditions or the impact they would have on our consumers or business.\n23. If our international markets are not successful, our business could suffer.\nWe currently sell our products in the international markets of Canada, Mexico, Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, the Republic of Ireland, Namibia, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Our international operations could experience changes in legal and regulatory requirements, as well as difficulties in adapting to new foreign cultures and business customs. If we do not adequately address such issues, our international markets may not meet growth expectations. Our international operations and future expansion plans are subject to political, economic, and social uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7 inflation;\n\u00b7 the renegotiation or modification of various agreements;\n\u00b7 increases in custom duties and tariffs;\n\u00b7 changes and limits in export controls;\n\u00b7 government regulations and laws;\n\u00b7 trademark availability and registration issues;\n\u00b7 changes in exchange rates;\n\u00b7 changes in taxation;\n\u00b7 wars and other hostilities; and\n\u00b7 changes in the perception of network marketing.\nAny negative changes related to these factors could adversely affect our business, profitability, and growth prospects. Furthermore, any negative changes in our distribution channels may force us to invest significant time and money related to our distribution and sales to maintain our position in certain international markets.\n24. Adverse or negative publicity could cause our business to suffer.\nOur business depends, in part, on the public\u2019s perception of our integrity and the safety and quality of our products. Any adverse publicity could negatively affect the public\u2019s perception about our industry, our products, or our reputation and could result in a significant decline in our operations and/or the number of our independent associates. Specifically, we are susceptible to adverse or negative publicity regarding:\n\u00b7 the nutritional supplements industry;\n\u00b7 skeptical consumers;\n\u00b7 competitors;\n\u00b7 the safety and quality of our products and/or our ingredients;\n\u00b7 regulatory investigations of our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7 the actions of our independent associates;\n\u00b7 the direct selling/network marketing industry; and\n\u00b7 scandals within the industries in which we operate.\n25. If our information technology system fails or if the implementation of new information technology systems is not executed efficiently and effectively, our business, financial position, and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nLike many companies, our business is heavily dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage and operate many of our key business functions, including:\n\u00b7 order processing;\n\u00b7 supply chain management;\n\u00b7 customer service;\n\u00b7 product distribution;\n\u00b7 commission processing;\n\u00b7 cash receipts and payments; and\n\u00b7 financial reporting.\nThese systems and operations are vulnerable to damage and interruption from fires, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, and other events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Although we maintain an extensive security system and disaster recovery program that was developed under the guidelines published by the National Institute of Standards of Technology, a long-term failure or impairment of any of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct day-to-day business.\nOccasionally information technology systems must be upgraded or replaced and if this system implementation is not executed efficiently and effectively, the implementation may cause interruptions in our primary management information systems, which may make our website or services unavailable thereby preventing us from processing transactions, which would adversely affect our financial position or operating results.\nWith increased frequency in recent years, cyber-attacks against companies have resulted in breaches of data security. Our business requires the storage and transmission of suppliers\u2019 data and our independent associates\u2019 personal, credit card, and other confidential information. Our information technology systems are susceptible to a growing and evolving threat of cybersecurity risk. Any substantial compromise of our data security, whether externally or internally, or misuse of associate data, could cause considerable damage to our reputation, cause the public disclosure of confidential information, and result in lost sales, significant costs, and litigation, which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\n26. Taxation and transfer pricing affect our operations and we could be subjected to additional taxes, duties, interest, and penalties in material amounts, which could harm our business.\nAs a multinational corporation, in many countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that our intercompany transactions are consummated at prices that have not been manipulated to produce a desired tax result, that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by the local entities, and that we are taxed appropriately on such transactions. Regulators closely monitor our corporate structure, intercompany transactions, and how we effectuate intercompany fund transfers. If regulators challenge our corporate structure, transfer pricing methodologies or intercompany transfers, our operations may be harmed and our effective tax rate may increase.\nA change in applicable tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could be significant to our financial results. In the event any audit or assessments are concluded adversely to us, these matters could have a material impact on our financial condition.\n27. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce our overall profits.\nIn 2014 and 2013, we recognized 66.8% and 63.3%, respectively, of net sales in markets outside of the United States. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to translate certain financial information from foreign currencies to the United States dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted-average exchange rate. If the United States dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies, there is a risk our reported sales, operating expenses, and net income could significantly fluctuate. For example, while our 2014 net sales grew 7.9% on a Constant dollar basis (see Item 7, Non-GAAP Financial Measures), unfavorable foreign exchange caused a $1.4 million decline in GAAP net sales as compared to 2013. In other words, sales would have been $1.4 million higher, except for the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. There can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows. We are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations, nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging contracts or participated in any hedging or derivative activities.\n28. Our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate significantly.\nThe price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases. Decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock. The price of our common stock and the price at which we could sell securities in the future could significantly fluctuate in response to:\n\u00b7 broad market fluctuations and general economic conditions;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u00b7 future securities offerings;\n\u00b7 changes in the market\u2019s perception of our products or our business, including false or negative publicity;\n\u00b7 governmental regulatory actions;\n\u00b7 the outcome of any lawsuits;\n\u00b7 financial and business announcements made by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 the general condition of the industry; and\n\u00b7 the sale of large amounts of stock by insiders.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies. The changes sometimes appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock in the open market could fluctuate based on factors that have little or nothing to do with us or that are outside of our control.\n29. Certain shareholders, directors, and officers own a significant amount of our stock, which could allow them to influence corporate transactions and other matters.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our directors and executive officers collectively with their families and affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 20.2% of our total outstanding common stock. As a result, if two or more of these shareholders choose to act together based on their current share ownership, they may be able to control a significant percentage of the total outstanding shares of our common stock, which could affect the outcome of a shareholder vote on the election of directors, the adoption of stock option plans, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, or the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions.\n30. We have implemented anti-takeover provisions that may help discourage a change of control.\nCertain provisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the Texas Business Organizations Code help discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire our Company, even if the proposal may benefit our shareholders. Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the power to determine the price and terms of any preferred stock. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without shareholders\u2019 approval could deter or delay unsolicited changes of control by discouraging open market purchases of our common stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for our common stock. Discouraging open market purchases may be disadvantageous to our shareholders who may otherwise desire to participate in a transaction in which they would receive a premium for their shares.\nIn addition, other provisions may also discourage a change of control by means of a tender offer, open market purchase, proxy contest or otherwise. Our charter documents provide for three classes of directors on our Board of Directors with members of each class serving staggered three year terms. Our bylaws provide that directors are elected by a plurality vote and that directors can only be removed for cause upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to be cast for the election of such directors. Furthermore, our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings. In addition, the Texas Business Organization Code restricts, subject to exceptions, business combinations with any \u201caffiliated shareholder.\u201d Any or all of these provisions could delay, deter or help prevent a takeover of our Company and could limit the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\n31. Our failure to comply with the NASDAQ Global Select Market continued listing standards may adversely affect the price and liquidity of our shares of common stock as well as our ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Continued listing of a security on Nasdaq is conditioned upon compliance with various continued listing standards. There can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy the requirements for maintaining listing on Nasdaq. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, then our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock is delisted and we cannot obtain listing on another major market or exchange, our common stock\u2019s liquidity would suffer, and we would likely experience reduced investor interest. Such factors may result in a decrease in our common stock\u2019s trading price. Delisting may also restrict us from issuing additional securities or securing financing.\nTo continue to have our common stock eligible for continued listing on Nasdaq, we would need to satisfy criteria under at least one of the three standards set forth by the Nasdaq Stock Market. Under Equity Standard Listing Rules 5450(a) and 5450(b)(1), these criteria require that:\n\u00b7 we have shareholders\u2019 equity of at least $10 million;\n\u00b7 our common stock has at least $1.00 minimum bid for 30 consecutive business days;\n\u00b7 our public float must consist of at least 750,000 shares with a market value of at least $5 million (public float is defined under Nasdaq\u2019s rules as the shares held by persons other than officers, directors and beneficial owners of greater than 10% of our total outstanding shares);\n\u00b7 there be at least 400 shareholders;\n\u00b7 there be at least two market makers for our common stock; and\n\u00b7 we comply with certain corporate governance requirements.\nAs of the date of issuance of this report, we were in compliance with these continued listing requirements. However, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to meet all requisite continued listing criteria.\n32. We are not required to pay dividends, and our Board of Directors may decide not to declare dividends in the future.\nThe declaration of dividends on our common stock is solely within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to limitations under Texas law stipulating that dividends may not be paid if payment therefore would cause the corporation to be insolvent or if the amount of the dividend would exceed the surplus of the corporation. Our Board of Directors may decide not to declare dividends or we could be prevented from declaring a dividend because of legal or contractual restrictions. The failure to pay dividends could reduce our stock price. Our Board of Directors suspended dividends in August 2009. We may not resume payment of dividends in the future.\n33. We rely upon our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations to fund our business. In the event that we do not generate adequate cash flow from operations, we will need to raise money through a debt or equity financing, if available, or curtail operations.\nThe adequacy of our cash resources to continue to meet our future operational needs depends, in large part, on our ability to increase product sales and/or reduce operating costs. If we are unsuccessful in generating positive cash flow from operations, we could exhaust our available cash resources and be required to secure additional funding through a debt or equity financing, significantly scale back our operations, and/or discontinue many of our activities, which could negatively affect our business and prospects. Additional funding may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\n34. The reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us as a \"smaller reporting company\" may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company\" as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a smaller reporting company we prepare and file SEC forms similar to other SEC reporting companies; however, the information disclosed may differ and be less comprehensive. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of less comprehensive information we may disclose pursuant to the exemptions available to us as a smaller reporting company, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile than that of an otherwise comparable company that does not avail itself of the same or similar exemptions.\nCircumstances and conditions may change. Accordingly, additional risks and uncertainties not currently known, or that we currently deem not material, may also adversely affect our business operations.\n35. Potential disputes with our founder could adversely affect our business.\nWe entered into a renewable consulting agreement, which expired February 28, 2014, with WonderEnterprises, LLC (f/k/a/ Salinda Enterprises, LLC; hereinafter \u201cWonder\u201d) for the consulting services of Mr. Samuel L. Caster, our founder and former Chairman of the Board, who is also an owner and employee of Wonder. The parties did not renew the agreement.\nFollowing Mr. Caster\u2019s launching of a competing business, we issued a press release on June 17, 2014 to clarify that the competing business was not affiliated with, nor a spin-off of Mannatech. Disputes with Mr. Caster could have an a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, including litigation relating to enforcement of covenants in prior consulting and employment agreements.", "PERMNO": 86728, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "MTEX"}
