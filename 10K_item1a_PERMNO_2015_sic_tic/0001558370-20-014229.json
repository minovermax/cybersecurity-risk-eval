{"cik": "808326", "company": "EMCORE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Effects of COVID-19 and Other Potential Future Public Health Crises, Epidemics, Pandemics or Similar Events.\nThe full effects of COVID-19 and other potential future public health crises, epidemics, pandemics or similar events are uncertain and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government in March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economy, disrupted global supply chains, significantly restricted travel and transportation, resulted in mandated closures and orders to \u201cshelter-in-place,\u201d and created significant disruption of the financial markets. The full extent of the COVID-19 impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by the U.S. government, state and local government officials, and international governments to prevent disease spread, all of which are uncertain, out of our control and cannot be predicted.\nIn accordance with applicable U.S. state and county ordinances generally exempting essential businesses and/or critical infrastructure workforces from mandated closures and orders to \u201cshelter-in-place,\u201d our U.S. production facilities have continued to operate in support of essential products and services, subject to limitations and requirements pursuant to applicable state and county orders with regard to ongoing operations that have reduced the efficiency of our engineering and operational teams. However, facility closures or further work slowdowns or temporary stoppages could occur, and in some cases, our facilities and supplier facilities are not operating under full staffing as a result of COVID-19, which could have a longer-term impact and could delay our development efforts and our deliveries to customers. In addition, other countries have different practices and policies that can affect our international operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. For example, operations at our Beijing facility ceased for one additional week beyond the Chinese New Year holiday in early February as a result of the COVID-19 situation, and additional closures could occur.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected, and could have further negative effects on, the timing of the sale and transfer of certain CATV module and transmitter manufacturing equipment that we have agreed, as part of our efforts to streamline operations and move to a variable cost model in our CATV Lasers and Transmitters product line, to sell to Hytera HK and Shenzhen Hytera (together with Hytera HK, the \u201cBuyers\u201d), for use by the Buyers in connection with the manufacturing of certain CATV module and transmitter products for us from a manufacturing facility located in Thailand. The sale and transfer of the equipment will occur in three separate closings, one of which occurred in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and the other two of which are now expected to occur during the quarters ending March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The timing and completion of these transfers may be further disrupted as a result of COVID-19, which could delay our recognition of the anticipated benefits of transferring this equipment and could disrupt our manufacturing activities for these products.\nIf significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, absenteeism, government actions, facility closures, travel restrictions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will be negatively impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The impact of COVID-19 could worsen if there is an extended duration of any COVID-19 outbreak or a resurgence of COVID-19 infection in affected regions after they have begun to experience improvement.\nAs described elsewhere in Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we rely on other companies to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts where we rely on these third parties. Many of our suppliers have at times temporarily ceased or limited their operations as a result of COVID-19 and failed to deliver parts or components to us. For example, in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, unexpected push-outs and cancellations of key component deliveries caused disruption to our business, and these actions may\ncontinue in the future. An extended period of global supply chain disruption caused by the response to COVID-19 could impact our ability to perform on our contracts and, if we are not able to implement alternatives or other mitigations, product deliveries could be adversely impacted. In addition, the rapid decline in commercial airline traffic created shortages in air freight capacity, making it more difficult and costly to timely procure parts and components.\nAs a result of COVID-19, we could see reduced customer orders in certain of our product lines, which could adversely affect our revenues, financial performance and cash flows, and could result in inventory write-downs and impairment losses. Significant delays in inspection, acceptance and payment by our customers, many of whom are teleworking, could also affect our revenues and cash flows, and current limitations on travel to customers could impact orders. For example, qualification testing for certain of our products has been delayed due to customer engineering shortages and limitations on their ability to access their facilities. In addition, limitations on government operations can also impact regulatory approvals such as export licenses that are needed for international sales and deliveries for certain of our products. Government funding priorities may change as a result of the costs of COVID-19, which could adversely affect our revenues arising from government contracts or subcontracts, and with respect to such contracts, we could experience delays in new program starts or awards of future work or in timelines for current programs, as well as the uncertain impact of contract modifications to respond to the national emergency.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which, depending on future developments, could impact our capital resources and liquidity in the future. If we need to raise additional capital to support operations in the future, we may be unable to access capital markets and additional capital may only be available to us on terms that could be significantly detrimental to our existing stockholders and to our business as a result of COVID-19. We are also monitoring the impacts of COVID-19 on the fair value of our assets. While we do not currently anticipate any material impairments on our assets as a result of COVID-19, future changes in expectations for sales, earnings and cash flows related to intangible assets and goodwill below our current projections could cause these assets to be impaired.\nRisks Related to Demand, Competition, Product Development and Manufacture and Operations\nWe have incurred losses from continuing operations and our future profitability is not certain.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, loss from operations was $7.0 million, $36.0 million and $17.5 million, respectively. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot be certain that we will be profitable or that we will not experience substantial losses in the future. If we are not able to increase revenue and reduce our costs, we may not be able to achieve profitability in future periods and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe are a small company and dependent on a few products for our success.\nWe are a small company with a narrow, focused portfolio of products. Our small size could cause our cash flow, results of operations and growth prospects to be more volatile and makes us more vulnerable to focused competition. As a small company, we will be subject to greater revenue fluctuations if our older product lines\u2019 sales were to decline faster than we anticipate. In addition, we may not be able to appropriately restructure or maintain our supporting functions to fit the needs of a small company, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our shareholders.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, and cash flows from our operating activities and funds available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we operate in industries that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate. It is possible that we may not generate sufficient\ncash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs. If this occurs, we may need additional financing to continue operations or execute on our current or future business strategies, including to:\n\u2022 invest in our research and development efforts, including by hiring additional technical and other personnel;\n\u2022 maintain and expand our operating or manufacturing infrastructure;\n\u2022 acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies; or\n\u2022 otherwise pursue our strategic plans and respond to competitive pressures.\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. Furthermore, in the event adequate capital is not available to us as required, or is not available on favorable terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe are substantially dependent on revenues from a small number of customers. The loss of or decrease in sales from any one of these customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue, and our dependence on orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critically important to our business. For example, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, sales to three customers accounted for an aggregate of 57% of our total consolidated revenues, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, sales to three customers accounted for an aggregate of 55% of our total consolidated revenues, and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, sales to two customers accounted for an aggregate of 60% of our total consolidated revenues. Revenue from any of our major customers may decline or fluctuate significantly in the future. We may not be able to offset any decline in sales from our existing major customers with sales from new customers or other existing customers. Because of our reliance on a limited number of customers, any decrease in sales from, or loss of, one or more of these customers without a corresponding increase in sales from other customers would harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, any negative developments in the business of existing significant customers could result in significantly decreased sales to these customers, which could seriously harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows, and if there is consolidation among our customer base, our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect our profitability. If we are required to reduce our pricing, our revenue and gross margins would be adversely impacted. Consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAlthough we are attempting to expand our customer base, the markets in which we sell our products are dominated by a relatively small number of companies, thereby limiting the number of potential customers. Accordingly, our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers, and we expect that the majority of our sales will continue to depend on sales of our products to a limited number of customers for the foreseeable future.\nOur future revenue is inherently unpredictable. As a result, our operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period, and we may fail to meet the expectations of our analysts and/or investors, which may cause volatility in our stock price and may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated substantially in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u2022 a downturn in the markets for our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022 discontinuation by our vendors of, or unavailability of, components or services used in our products;\n\u2022 disruptions or delays in our manufacturing processes or in our supply of raw materials or product components;\n\u2022 a failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements;\n\u2022 market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022 cancellations or postponements of previously placed orders;\n\u2022 increased financing costs or any inability to obtain necessary financing;\n\u2022 the impact on our business of current or future cost reduction measures;\n\u2022 a loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers;\n\u2022 economic conditions in various geographic areas where we or our customers do business;\n\u2022 the impact of political uncertainties, such as government sequestration and uncertainties surrounding the federal budget, customer spending and demand for our products;\n\u2022 significant warranty claims, including those not covered by our suppliers;\n\u2022 product liability claims;\n\u2022 other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders;\n\u2022 reductions in prices for our products or increases in the costs of our raw materials;\n\u2022 effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products;\n\u2022 fluctuations in manufacturing yields;\n\u2022 obsolescence of products;\n\u2022 research and development expenses incurred associated with new product introductions;\n\u2022 natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and floods;\n\u2022 pandemics, including COVID-19;\n\u2022 the emergence of new industry standards;\n\u2022 the loss or gain of significant customers;\n\u2022 the introduction of new products and manufacturing processes;\n\u2022 changes in technology;\n\u2022 intellectual property disputes;\n\u2022 customs (including tariffs imposed on our products or raw materials, equipment or components used in the production of our products), import/export, and other regulations of the countries in which we do business;\n\u2022 the occurrence of M&A activities; and\n\u2022 acts of terrorism or violence and international conflicts or crises.\nIn addition, the limited lead times with which several of our customers order our products restrict our ability to forecast revenue. We may also experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons. For example, in certain of our product lines, orders at the beginning of each quarter typically represent a small percentage of expected revenue for that quarter. We depend on obtaining orders during each quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve our revenue objectives. Failure to ship these products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be solely relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the markets in which we compete and any future downturn may reduce demand for our products and revenue.\nIn the past, the markets in which we compete have experienced significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, the maturation of product cycles, for both manufacturers\u2019 and their customers\u2019 products, and declining general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels, and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. These markets are impacted by the aggregate capital expenditures of service providers and enterprises as they build out and upgrade their network infrastructure. These markets are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, pricing pressures, evolving standards, and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand.\nWe may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future results of operations. Any future downturn in the markets in which we compete, or changes in demand for our products from our customers, could result in a significant reduction in our revenue and may also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the communication networks industry from time to time has experienced and may again experience a pronounced downturn. To respond to a downturn, many service providers and enterprises may slow their capital expenditures, cancel or delay new developments, reduce their workforces and inventories, and take a cautious approach to acquiring new equipment and technologies, any of which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period and harm our business.\nCustomer demand is difficult to forecast and, as a result, we may be unable to optimally match production with customer demand.\nWe make planning and spending decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer demand. While our customers generally provide us with their demand forecasts, they are typically not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond firm purchase orders. The short-term nature of our customer commitments and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products limit our ability to accurately predict future customer demand. On occasion, customers have required rapid increases in production, which has strained our resources. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet the volume demands of our customers, or one or more of our suppliers may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our volume demands. Conversely, a downturn in the markets in which our customers compete can cause, and in the past has caused, our customers to significantly reduce the amount of products ordered from us or to cancel existing orders, leading to lower utilization of our facilities. Because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, reduction in customer demand would have an adverse effect on our gross margin, results of operations, and cash flow. During an industry downturn, there is also a higher risk that a larger portion of our trade receivables would be uncollectible. In addition, certain of our arrangements with component vendors require us to purchase minimum quantities of components within specific time periods, which could cause us to hold excess inventories of these components during periods concurrent with a decrease in customer demand for our products.\nOur acquisition of Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. and acquisitions of other companies or investments in joint ventures with other companies could adversely affect our operating results, dilute our shareholders' equity, or cause us to incur additional debt or assume contingent liabilities.\nTo increase our business, maintain our competitive position or for other business or strategic reasons, we may acquire other companies or engage in joint ventures or similar transactions in the future. For example, in June 2019, we acquired Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. (\u201cSDI\u201d), a navigation systems provider with a scalable, chip-based platform for higher volume gyro applications utilizing Quartz MEMS technology. Our acquisition of SDI, and any other acquisitions, joint ventures and similar transactions that we may enter into from time to time, involve a number of risks that could harm our business and result in SDI or any other acquired business or joint venture not performing as expected, including:\n\u2022 problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies, or products with the existing business and products;\n\u2022 failure to achieve cost savings or other financial or operating objectives with respect to an acquisition;\n\u2022 possible adverse short-term effects on our cash flows or operating results, and the use of cash and other resources for the acquisition that might affect our liquidity, and that could have been used for other purposes;\n\u2022 diversion of management's time and attention from our core business to the acquired business or joint venture;\n\u2022 potential failure to retain key technical, management, sales, and other personnel of the acquired business or joint venture;\n\u2022 difficulties in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business, particularly where such customers or suppliers compete with us;\n\u2022 difficulties in the integration of financial reporting systems, which could cause a delay in the issuance of, or impact the reliability of our financial statements;\n\u2022 failure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including a delay in or failure to successfully integrate these businesses into our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022 insufficient experience with technologies and markets in which the acquired business is involved, which may be necessary to successfully operate and integrate the business;\n\u2022 reliance upon joint ventures which we do not control;\n\u2022 subsequent impairment of goodwill and acquired long-lived assets, including intangible assets; and\n\u2022 assumption of liabilities including, but not limited to, lawsuits, environmental liabilities, regulatory liabilities, tax examinations and warranty issues.\nWe may decide that it is in our best interests to enter into acquisitions, joint ventures or similar transactions that are dilutive to earnings per share or that adversely impact margins as a whole. In addition, acquisitions or joint ventures could require investment of significant financial resources and require us to obtain additional equity financing, which may dilute our shareholders' equity, or require us to incur indebtedness.\nWe expect to consider from time to time further strategic opportunities that may involve acquisitions, dispositions, investments in joint ventures, partnerships, and other strategic alternatives that may enhance shareholder value, any of which may result in the use of a significant amount of our management resources or significant costs, and we may not be able to fully realize the potential benefit of such transactions.\nWe expect to continue to consider acquisitions, dispositions, investments in joint ventures, partnerships, and other strategic alternatives that may enhance shareholder value. The Strategy and Alternatives Committee of the Board and our management may from time to time be engaged in evaluating potential transactions and other strategic alternatives. In addition, from time to time, we may engage financial advisors, enter into non-disclosure agreements, conduct discussions, and undertake other actions that may result in one or more transactions. Although there would be uncertainty that any of these activities or discussions would result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction, we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to analyzing and pursuing such a transaction, which could negatively impact our operations. In addition, we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking such transactions or other strategic alternatives regardless of whether the transaction is completed. In the event that we consummate an acquisition, disposition, partnership, or other or strategic alternative in the future, we cannot be certain that we would fully realize the potential benefit of such a transaction and cannot predict the impact that such strategic transaction might have on our operations or stock price. We do not intend to provide updates or make further comments regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives, unless otherwise required by law.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the transition of certain of our manufacturing operations from our Beijing facility to a contract manufacturer\u2019s facility, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nIn October 2019, we entered into (i) an agreement with Hytera Communications (Hong Kong) Company Limited and Shenzhen Hytera Communications Co., Ltd. (collectively, \u201cHytera\u201d) to transfer and sell to Hytera the equipment that was being used by us to manufacture certain of our CATV modules and transmitters and (ii) an agreement pursuant to which Hytera agreed to manufacture such CATV modules and transmitters for sale to us. In connection with these agreements, the manufacture of our product lines and sub-assemblies previously manufactured at our Beijing facility is in the process of being relocated to a facility located in Thailand.\nThis transition could involve the re-acceptance and requalification of certain of our products by customers, potentially creating a competitive disadvantage for our products. These initiatives can be time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and costly in the short-term. In addition, restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively affected the timing of the sale and transfer of certain CATV module and transmitter manufacturing equipment to Hytera.\nTravel into Thailand by our manufacturing engineers to support the transfer remains difficult, and customer product qualification processes for products being manufactured in Thailand are being delayed due to our customers\u2019 inability to access their facilities to perform testing. The timing and completion of these transfers may be further disrupted as a result of COVID-19, which could delay our recognition of the anticipated benefits of transferring this equipment and could disrupt our manufacturing activities for these products. This transition has also and will continue to cause us to incur costs associated with the shipment of complex manufacturing equipment. If we are unable to manage this transfer smoothly and comprehensively, we could suffer delays, resulting in harm to our reputation with our customers and potentially loss of customers. If we are unable to successfully manage the relocation or initiation of the manufacture of these products by our contract manufacturer, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nOur products are complex and may take longer to develop and qualify than anticipated and we face lengthy sales and qualification cycles for our new products and, in many cases, must invest a substantial amount of time and money before we receive orders.\nWe are constantly developing new products and using new technologies in these products. These products often take substantial time to develop because of their complexity, rigorous testing and qualification requirements and because customer and market requirements can change during the product development or qualification process. Most of our products are tested by current and potential customers to determine whether they meet customer or industry specifications. The length of the qualification process, which can span a year or more, varies substantially by product and customer and, thus, can cause our results of operations and cash flows to be unpredictable. During a given qualification period, we invest significant resources and allocate substantial production capacity to manufacture these new products prior to any commitment to purchase by customers. In addition, it is difficult to obtain new customers during the qualification period as customers are reluctant to expend the resources necessary to qualify a new supplier if they have one or more existing qualified sources. If we are unable to meet applicable specifications or do not receive sufficient orders to profitably use our allocated production capacity, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur historical and future budgets for operating expenses, capital expenditures, operating leases, and service contracts are based upon our assumptions as to the future market acceptance of our products. Because of the lengthy lead times required for product development and the changes in technology that typically occur while a product is being developed, it is difficult to accurately estimate customer demand for any given product. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of customer demand, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur products are difficult to manufacture. Our production could be disrupted and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer if our production yields are low as a result of manufacturing difficulties.\nWe manufacture many of our wafers and products in our own production facilities. Difficulties in the production process, such as contamination, raw material quality issues, human error, or equipment failure, could cause a substantial percentage of wafers and devices to be nonfunctional. These problems may be difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and often are time-consuming and expensive to correct. Lower-than-expected production yields may delay shipments or result in unexpected levels of warranty claims, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. We have experienced difficulties in achieving planned yields in the past, particularly in pre-production and upon initial commencement of full production volumes, which have adversely affected our gross margins. Because the majority of our manufacturing costs are fixed, achieving planned production yields is critical to our results of operations and cash flows. Changes in manufacturing processes required as a result of changes in product specifications, changing customer needs and the introduction of new product lines could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields, resulting in low or negative margins on those products. In addition, transitioning to automation in certain manufacturing processes could result in manufacturing delays or significantly reduce our manufacturing yields.\nManufacturing yields depend on a number of factors, including the stability and manufacturability of the product design, manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes, the quality and consistency of component\nparts and the nature and extent of customization requirements by customers. Higher volume demand for more mature designs requiring less customization generally results in higher manufacturing yields than products with lower volumes, less mature designs and requiring extensive customization. Capacity constraints, raw materials shortages, logistics issues, the introduction of new product lines and changes in our customer requirements, manufacturing facilities or processes or those of our third-party contract manufacturers (\u201cCMs\u201d) and component suppliers have historically caused, and may in the future cause, significantly reduced manufacturing yields, negatively impacting the gross margins on, and our production capacity for, those products. Our ability to maintain sufficient manufacturing yields is particularly important with respect to certain products we manufacture, as a result of the long manufacturing process. Moreover, an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before, during or after manufacture would result in lower yields, gross margins and production capacity. Finally, manufacturing yields and margins can also be lower if we receive and inadvertently use defective or contaminated materials from our suppliers.\nWe also have substantial risk of interruption in manufacturing resulting from fire, natural disaster, equipment failures, acts of government, or similar events, because we manufacture most of our products using a few facilities, and do not have back-up facilities available for manufacturing these products. We could also incur significant costs to repair or replace products that are defective and in some cases costly product redesigns and/or rework may be required to correct a defect. Additionally, any defect could adversely affect our reputation and result in the loss of future orders.\nSome of the capital equipment used in the manufacture of our products have been developed and made specifically for us, may not be readily available from multiple vendors, and would be difficult to repair or replace if they were to become damaged or stop working. If any of these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or go out of business, or if there were any damage to, or a breakdown of our manufacturing equipment at a time when we are manufacturing commercial quantities of our products, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not keep pace with rapid technological change, our products may not be competitive.\nWe compete in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements, evolving industry standards, continuous improvement in products and the use of our existing products in new applications. We may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements to our existing products at the same rate as or faster than our competitors, to develop products that effectively compete with competitors\u2019 products used in new applications, such as remote physical layer, or to license the technology from third parties that is necessary for our products. Product development delays may result from numerous factors, including:\n\u2022 changing product specifications and customer requirements;\n\u2022 unanticipated engineering complexities;\n\u2022 expense reduction measures we have implemented and others we may implement;\n\u2022 difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel; and\n\u2022 difficulties in allocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market, or support new or enhanced products successfully, if at all, or on a timely, cost effective, or repeatable basis. Our future performance will depend on our successful development and introduction of, as well as market acceptance of, new and enhanced products that address market changes, as well as current and potential customer requirements and our ability to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors, technological changes, or emerging industry standards. Because it is generally not possible to predict the amount of time required and the costs involved in achieving certain research, development and engineering objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. If we are unable to develop, manufacture, market, or support new or enhanced products\nsuccessfully, or incur budget overruns or delays in our research and development efforts, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nSpending to develop and improve our technology may adversely impact our financial results.\nWe may need to increase our research and development and/or capital expenditures and expenses above our historical run-rate model in order to attempt to improve our existing technology and develop new technology. Increasing our investments in research and development of technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. If we are unable to fund these types of expenditures, we may be unable to improve our technology or develop new technologies, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, our research and development programs may not produce successful results, and our new products and services may not achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue or become profitable, which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial results and liquidity.\nThe competitive and rapidly evolving nature of our industries and pressure from competitors with greater resources has in the past resulted in and is likely in the future to result in reductions in our product prices and periods of reduced demand for our products.\nWe face substantial competition from a number of companies, many of which have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technical resources than we do. Larger-sized competitors often spend more on research and development, which could give those competitors an advantage in meeting customer demands and introducing technologically innovative products before we do. We expect that existing and new competitors will continue to improve the design of their existing products and will introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics.\nThe introduction of new products and more efficient production of existing products by our competitors have resulted and are likely in the future to result in price reductions, increases in expenses, and reduced demand for our products. In addition, some of our competitors may be willing to provide their products at lower prices, accept a lower profit margin, or spend more capital in order to obtain or retain business. Competitive pressures have required us to reduce the prices of some of our products. These competitive forces could diminish our market share and gross margins, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nNew competitors may also enter our markets, including some of our current and potential customers who may attempt to integrate their operations by producing their own components and subsystems or acquiring one of our competitors, thereby reducing demand for our products. In addition, rapid product development cycles, increasing price competition due to maturation of technologies, the emergence of new competitors in Asia with lower cost structures, and industry consolidation resulting in competitors with greater financial, marketing, and technical resources could result in lower prices or reduced demand for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nExpected and actual introductions of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products and may cause our products to become obsolete. A slowdown in demand for existing products ahead of a new product introduction could result in a write-down in the value of inventory on hand related to existing products. We have in the past experienced a slowdown in demand for existing products and delays in new product development and such delays may occur in the future. To the extent customers defer or cancel orders for existing products due to a slowdown in demand or in anticipation of a new product release, or if there is any delay in development or introduction of our new products or enhancements of our products, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nA failure to attract and retain managerial, technical, and other key personnel could reduce our revenue and our operational effectiveness.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain certain key personnel, including scientific, operational, financial, and managerial personnel. In addition, our technical personnel represent a significant asset and serve as the source of our technological and product innovations. The competition for attracting and retaining key employees (especially scientists, technical personnel, and senior managers and executives) is intense. Because of this competition for skilled employees, we may be unable to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future to keep up with our business demands and changes, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The risks involved in recruiting and retaining these key personnel may be increased by our historical lack of profitability, the volatility of our stock price, and the perceived effect of previously implemented reductions in force and other cost reduction efforts.\nIf spending for CATV and optical communications networks declines, our revenues and financial performance may decline.\nA material portion of our revenues depend on continued capital investment in CATV and global communications networks infrastructure and on continued demand for high-bandwidth, high-speed communications networks and the ability of original equipment manufacturers to meet this demand. Spending on CATV and communications networks is limited by several factors, including limited investment resources, uncertainty regarding the long-term evolution and sustainability of service provider business models, and a changing regulatory environment. We cannot be certain that demand for bandwidth-intensive content will continue to grow at the same pace in the future or that communications service providers will continue to increase spending to meet such demand. If expectations for growth of CATV and communications networks and bandwidth consumption are not realized and investment in CATV and communications networks does not grow as anticipated, our revenues, results of operations, and gross margins could be harmed.\nOur ability to achieve operational and material cost reductions and to realize production efficiencies for our operations is critical to our ability to achieve long-term profitability.\nWe have implemented a number of operational and material cost reductions and productivity improvement initiatives, which are intended to reduce our cost structure at both the cost of revenue and the operating expense levels. Cost reduction initiatives often involve the re-design of our products, which requires our customers to accept and qualify the new designs, potentially creating a competitive disadvantage for our products. These initiatives can be time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and costly in the short-term. Successfully implementing these and other cost-reduction initiatives throughout our operations is critical to our future competitiveness and ability to achieve long-term profitability. However, we cannot be certain that these initiatives will be successful in creating profit margins sufficient to sustain our current operating structure and business.\nOur operating results could be harmed if we are unable to obtain timely deliveries of sufficient materials, components, or services of acceptable quality from sole or limited sources of materials, components, or services, or if the prices of materials, components, or services for which we do not have alternative sources increase.\nWe currently obtain materials, components, and services used in our products from limited or sole sources. We generally do not carry significant inventories of any raw materials. The reliance on a sole supplier, single qualified vendor or limited number of suppliers could result in delivery or quality problems or reduced control over product pricing, reliability and performance. For example, many of our suppliers temporarily ceased or limited operations as a result of COVID-19 and failed to deliver parts or components to us in certain periods. Because we often do not account for a significant part of our suppliers\u2019 businesses, we may not have access to sufficient capacity from these suppliers in periods of high demand. In addition, since we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers, we risk serious disruption to our operations if an important supplier terminates product lines, changes business focus, or goes out of business, and we may need large end of life purchases when a sole source supplier is ceasing manufacturing\nof required components. Because some of these suppliers are located overseas, we may be faced with higher costs of purchasing these materials if the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, or if import tariffs are imposed on these materials. If we were to change any of our limited or sole source suppliers, we would be required to re-qualify each new supplier. Re-qualification could prevent or delay product shipments that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our reliance on these suppliers may adversely affect our production if the components vary in quality or quantity. If we are unable to obtain timely deliveries of sufficient components of acceptable quality or if the prices of components for which we do not have alternative sources increase, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our CMs fail to deliver qualified products at reasonable prices and on a timely basis, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe use CMs as a less-expensive alternative to our manufacturing of certain products. CMs in Asia currently manufacture a significant portion of our CATV fiber optics products. In some cases, we supply inventory to our CMs, and we bear the risk of loss, theft, or damage to our inventory while it is held in their facilities.\nIf these CMs do not fulfill their obligations to us, or if we do not properly manage these relationships and the transition of production to these CMs, our existing customer relationships may suffer. In addition, by undertaking these activities, we run the risk that the reputation and competitiveness of our products and services may deteriorate as a result of the reduction of our ability to oversee and control the assembly process, quality and delivery schedules. If we fail to manage our relationship with our CMs, or if any of the CMs experience financial difficulty, delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed.\nThe use of CMs located outside of the U.S. also subjects us to the following additional risks that could significantly impair our ability to source our contract manufacturing requirements internationally, including:\n\u2022 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 legal uncertainties regarding liability, tariffs, and other trade barriers;\n\u2022 inadequate protection of intellectual property in some countries;\n\u2022 greater incidence of shipping delays;\n\u2022 greater difficulty in overseeing manufacturing operations;\n\u2022 greater difficulty in hiring talent needed to oversee manufacturing operations;\n\u2022 potential political and economic instability and natural disasters;\n\u2022 potential adverse actions by the U.S. government pursuant to its stated intention to reduce the loss of U.S. jobs;\n\u2022 trade and travel restrictions; and\n\u2022 the outbreak of infectious diseases which could result in travel restrictions or the closure of the facilities of our CMs.\nAny of these factors could significantly impair our ability to source our contract manufacturing requirements internationally. Prior to our customers accepting products manufactured at our CMs, they must qualify the product and manufacturing processes. The qualification process determines whether the product manufactured at our CM achieves our customers' quality, performance, and reliability standards. The qualification process can be lengthy and expensive,\nwith no guarantee that any particular product qualification process will lead to profitable product sales, and our expectations as to the time periods required to qualify a product line and ship products in volumes to our customers may be erroneous. Delays in qualification can impair our expected timing of the transfer of a product line to our CM and may impair our expected amount of sales of the affected products. Any of these uncertainties or delays could adversely affect our operating results and customer relationships. For example, during 2020, customer product qualification processes for our CATV Laser and Transmitter products that were beginning to be manufactured at a CM\u2019s facility in Thailand were delayed due to our customers\u2019 inability to access their facilities to perform testing due to COVID-19, causing delays in our ability to have such products manufactured from this location and increasing our costs to produce these products.\nIn addition, certain of our CMs may terminate our agreements with them upon prior notice to us or immediately for reasons such as if we become insolvent or if we fail to perform a material obligation under the agreements. If we are required to change CMs or assume internal manufacturing operations for any reason, including the termination of one of our contracts, we will likely suffer manufacturing and shipping delays, lost revenue, increased costs and damage to our customer relationships, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe participate in vendor managed inventory programs for the benefit of certain of our customers, which could result in increased inventory levels and/or decreased visibility into the timing of sales.\nCertain of our significant customers have implemented a supply chain management tool called vendor managed inventory (\u201cVMI\u201d) that requires us to assume responsibility for maintaining an agreed upon level of consigned inventory at the customer\u2019s location or at a third-party logistics provider, based on the customer\u2019s demand forecast. Notwithstanding the fact that we or our CM builds and ships the inventory, the customer does not purchase the consigned inventory until the inventory is drawn or pulled from the customer or third-party location to be used in the manufacture of the customer\u2019s product. Though the consigned inventory may be at the customer\u2019s or third-party logistics provider\u2019s physical location, it remains inventory owned by us until the inventory is drawn or pulled, which is the time at which the sale takes place. In addition, certain of our customers require us to maintain agreed levels of product inventory at our own locations. Our participation in VMI programs and our commitment to other product inventory requirements at our own locations has resulted in our experiencing higher levels of inventory than we might otherwise and has decreased our visibility into the timing of when our finished goods will ultimately result in revenue-generating sales.\nSuch VMI programs and other inventory requirements increase the likelihood that estimates of our customers\u2019 requirements that prove to be greater than our customers\u2019 actual purchases could result in surplus inventory and we could be required to record charges for obsolete or excess inventories. If we are unable to effectively manage our customers\u2019 VMI programs or other inventory requirements, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIt could be discovered that our products contain defects that may cause us to incur significant costs, divert management's attention, result in a loss of customers, and result in product liability claims.\nOur products are complex and undergo quality testing and formal qualification by our customers and us. However, defects may occur from time to time. Our customers' testing procedures involve evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios and over varying amounts of time. For various reasons, such as the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable in testing or that are detected only when products age or are operated under peak stress conditions, our products may fail to perform as expected long after customer acceptance. Failures could result from faulty components or design, problems in manufacturing, or other unforeseen reasons. For the majority of our products, we provide a product warranty of one year or less from date of shipment. For select customers, we provide extended warranties beyond our normal product warranty period for specified failures on a case-by-case basis. As a result, we could incur significant costs to repair or replace defective products under warranty, particularly when such failures occur in installed systems. We have experienced failures in the past and will continue to face this risk going forward, as our products are widely deployed throughout the world in multiple demanding environments and applications. In addition, we may in certain circumstances honor warranty claims after the warranty has expired or for problems not covered by warranty in order to maintain customer relationships. Any significant product failure could\nresult in product recalls, product liability claims, lost future sales of the affected product and other products, as well as customer relations problems, litigation, and damage to our reputation.\nIn addition, our products are typically embedded in, or deployed in conjunction with, our customers' products, which incorporate a variety of components, modules and subsystems and may be expected to interpolate with modules and subsystems produced by third parties. As a result, not all defects are immediately detectable and when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant damages or warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and cause significant customer relations problems or loss of customers, all of which would harm our business. The occurrence of any defects in our products could also give rise to liability for damages caused by such defects. Although we carry product liability insurance to mitigate this risk, insurance may not adequately or entirely cover costs that may arise from defects in our products or otherwise, nor will it protect us from reputational harm that may result from such defects. Costs incurred in connection with product recalls or warranty or product liability claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nShifts in industry-wide demands and inventories could result in significant inventory write-downs.\nThe life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end products into which our products are designed. Products with short life cycles require us to manage production and inventory levels closely. We evaluate our ending inventories on a quarterly basis for excess quantities, impairment of value, and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers, sales team, and management. If inventories on hand are in excess of demand, or if they are generally greater than 12-months old, appropriate write-downs may be recorded. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand, manufacturing process changes that result in existing inventory obsolescence, or new product introductions, which eliminate demand for existing products. Remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our manufacturing cost or net realizable market value.\nIf future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our estimates, inventory write-downs may be required. We cannot be certain that obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products and/or the estimated life cycles of the end products into which our products are designed, will not affect us beyond the inventory charges that we have already taken.\nThe types of sales contracts we use in the markets we serve subject us to unique risks in each of those markets.\nWe generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our customers, we typically sell our products pursuant to purchase orders with short lead times, and even where we do have long-term supply contracts, our customers are typically not obligated to purchase any minimum amount of our products. As a result, in most cases our customers could stop purchasing our products at any time, and we must fulfill orders in a timely manner to keep our customers satisfied.\nRisks associated with an absence of long-term purchase commitments with our customers include the following:\n\u2022 our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty;\n\u2022 our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and\n\u2022 our customers are not required to make minimum purchases.\nThese risks are increased by the fact that our customers include large sophisticated companies that have considerable purchasing power and control over their suppliers. If we are unable to fulfill these orders in a timely manner, it is likely that we will lose sales and customers.\nThe majority of our development contracts are for a fixed price, and fixed-price development work inherently has more uncertainty than production contracts and, therefore, entails more variability in estimates of the cost to complete the work. Many of these development programs have very complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and adverse cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Some fixed-price development contracts include initial production units in their scope of work. Successful performance of these contracts depends on our ability to meet production specifications and delivery rates. If we are unable to meet these contract requirements, revenue from these contracts could be reduced through the incorporation of liquidated damages, the contract could be terminated for default, and we could be subject to other financially significant consequences. We use our best judgment to estimate the cost to perform the work and the price we will eventually be paid on fixed-price development programs. While we believe the cost and price estimates used to prepare our financial statements are appropriate, future events could result in unfavorable adjustments to those estimates which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance.\nFor certain risks, we do not maintain insurance coverage because of cost or availability. Because we retain some portion of our insurable risks, and in some cases self-insure completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to International Sales and Operations\nChanges in U.S. and international trade policies, particularly with regard to China, may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe U.S. government has recently taken certain actions with respect to its trade policies, including recently imposed tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in China, and may take further actions with respect to these policies in the future. For example, the U.S. and China have applied tariffs to certain of each other\u2019s exports. Certain of our broadband products manufactured by our Chinese affiliate have been included in the tariffs imposed on imports into the U.S. from China, and these products manufactured by our Chinese affiliate may be subject to tariff increases that may be implemented in the future. China has imposed retaliatory tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in the U.S. and imported into China, including our chip products manufactured in the U.S., and other products manufactured by us in the U.S. may be included on lists of products to be targeted by proposed tariff increases that may be implemented by China in the future. The implementation of these tariffs could result in decreased sales of our products manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. and sales of our products manufactured in the U.S. and shipped to China, which would negatively impact our business.\nIn addition, it is unknown whether and to what extent new tariffs (or other new laws or regulations) will be adopted that increase the cost of importing products into the U.S., or that might trigger retaliatory action by U.S. trading partners. Further, it is unknown what effect that any such new tariffs or retaliatory actions would have on us or our industries and customers. For example, there are risks that the Chinese government may, among other things, require the use of local suppliers, compel companies that do business in China to partner with local companies to conduct business and provide incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local suppliers. If any new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if China or other affected countries take retaliatory trade actions, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently have substantial operations in China, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in China.\nIn an effort to keep manufacturing costs down, we currently operate a manufacturing facility and certain operations logistics functions in China. Our China-based activities are subject to greater political, legal, and economic risks than those faced by our other operations. In particular, the political, legal, and economic climate in China (both at the national\nand regional levels) is extremely volatile and unpredictable. Our ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in, or our failure to comply with, Chinese laws and regulations, such as those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, intellectual property, labor and employment laws and other matters, which laws and regulations remain underdeveloped and subject to change for political or other reasons, with little or no prior notice. Moreover, the enforceability of applicable existing Chinese laws and regulations is uncertain. For example, since Chinese administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contract terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we would receive. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into with our distributors, business partners, customers and suppliers. In addition, protections of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in China may not be as effective as in the U.S. or other countries or regions. All of these uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAlso, if we are found to be, or to have been, in violation of Chinese laws or regulations governing technology import and export, the relevant regulatory authorities have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including, but not limited to, issuing a warning, levying fines, restricting us from benefiting from these technologies inside or outside of China, confiscating our earnings generated from the import or export of such technology or even restricting our future import and export of any technology.\nIn addition, we may not obtain the requisite legal permits to continue to operate in China and costs or operational limitations may be imposed in connection with obtaining and complying with such permits. Our business could be adversely harmed by any changes in the political, legal, or economic climate in China, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or our inability to enforce applicable Chinese laws and regulations.\nWhile under certain circumstances we previously were not subject to certain Chinese taxes and were exempt from customs duty assessment on imported components or materials when our finished products were exported from China, we are no longer eligible for such exemptions due to our current Beijing facility being located in a non-economic zone. In addition, we are required to pay income taxes in China subject to certain tax relief. We may become subject to other forms of taxation and duty assessments in China, including import tariffs as described in more detail above, or may be required to pay for export license fees in the future. In the event that we become subject to any increased taxes or new forms of taxation imposed by authorities in China, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRetention of employees in China is a challenge as compared to companies headquartered in China. If our China employee turnover rates are higher than we expect, or we otherwise fail to adequately manage these rates, then our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may have difficulty maintaining adequate management and financial controls over our China operations.\nBusinesses in China have historically not adopted a western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and computer, financial and other control systems. Moreover, familiarity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and reporting procedures is less common in China. As a consequence and due to our current operations in China, we may have difficulty employing accounting personnel experienced with U.S. GAAP, and we may have difficulty integrating our China-based accounting staff with our U.S.-based finance organization. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in maintaining adequate management and financial controls over our China operations. These difficulties include collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet U.S. public-company reporting requirements. We may, in turn, experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we cannot provide reliable and timely financial reports, our brand, operating results, and the market value of our equity securities could be harmed.\nWe have a large amount of intercompany balances with our China entities, which may be subject to taxes and penalties when we try to pay them down or collect them.\nPayments for goods and services into and out of China are subject to numerous and over-lapping government regulation with respect to foreign exchange controls, banking controls, import and export controls, and taxes. We have been operating in China for an extended period of time and have accumulated significant intercompany balances with our related entities. Our ability to repay or collect these balances may be restricted by Chinese laws and, as a result, we may be unable to successfully pay down or collect on these balances. As a consequence, we may be assessed additional taxes in China if we are unable to claim bad debt deductions or incur debt forgiveness income from the cancellation of these intercompany balances. Additionally, if we are found not to have complied with the various local laws surrounding cross border payments, we may incur penalties and fines for non-compliance. Any such taxes, penalties and/or fines could be significant in amount and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including our cash and cash equivalent balances.\nWe have significant international sales, which expose us to additional risks and uncertainties.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, sales to customers located outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 17%, 21% and 19%, respectively, of our annual consolidated revenue, with revenue assigned to geographic regions based on our customers\u2019 billing address. Sales to customers in Asia represent the majority of our international sales. We believe that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue as we seek international expansion opportunities. In addition, certain of our sales to customers with a U.S. billing address may be physically shipped to a location outside of the U.S. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of material risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 political and economic instability or changes in U.S. government policy with respect to the foreign countries where our customers are located may inhibit export of our products and limit potential customers\u2019 access to U.S. dollars in a country or region in which those potential customers are located;\n\u2022 we may experience difficulties in enforcing our legal contracts or the collecting of foreign accounts receivable in a timely manner and we may be forced to write off these receivables;\n\u2022 tariffs and other barriers may make our products less cost competitive or may reduce our gross margin on these products;\n\u2022 the laws of certain foreign countries may not adequately protect our trade secrets and intellectual property or may be burdensome to comply with;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences to our customers may damage our cost competitiveness;\n\u2022 customs, import/export, and other regulations of the countries in which we do business may adversely affect our business;\n\u2022 different technical standards or requirements, such as country or region-specific requirements to eliminate the use of lead, which we may incorporate into certain of our products, could prevent us from selling these products in these regions;\n\u2022 currency fluctuations may make our products less cost competitive, affecting overseas demand for our products or otherwise adversely affecting our business; and\n\u2022 language and other cultural barriers may require us to expend additional resources competing in foreign markets or hinder our ability to effectively compete.\nNegative developments in one or more countries or regions in which we operate or sell our products could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, difficulties in producing and delivering our products, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, or a higher cost of doing business, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, we may be exposed to legal risks under the laws of the countries outside the U.S. in which we do business, as well as the laws of the U.S. governing our business activities in those other countries, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\").\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property Rights, Litigation and Cybersecurity\nOur failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain intellectual property may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur industries are characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time we have received, and may receive in the future, notice of claims of infringement of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights and licensing offers to commercialize third party patent rights. Numerous patents in our industries are held by others, including our competitors and certain academic institutions. Our competitors may seek to gain a competitive advantage or other third parties may seek an economic return on their intellectual property portfolios by making infringement claims against us. We cannot be certain that:\n\u2022 infringement claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted against us or that such claims will not be successful;\n\u2022 future assertions will not result in an injunction against the sale of infringing products, which could require us to cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology and expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and cash flows;\n\u2022 any patent owned or licensed by us will not be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged; or\n\u2022 we will not be required to obtain licenses or pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology, the expense of which may adversely affect our results of operations, and cash flows.\nFor example, in June 2018, Phoenix Navigation Components, LLC (\u201cPhoenix\u201d) commenced an arbitration against us with the American Arbitration Association in New York and a special proceeding against us in the New York Supreme Court, Commercial Division. Please see the disclosures under the caption \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these proceedings.\nIn addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign jurisdictions. Litigation, which could result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, may be necessary to defend our rights or defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others. In certain circumstances, our intellectual property rights associated with government contracts may be limited.\nIf we fail to protect, or incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We have applied for patent registrations in the United States and selected international jurisdictions, most of which have been\nissued. We cannot guarantee that our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, our existing and future patents and trademarks may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights or may be held invalid or unenforceable in court. Failure to obtain patent registrations or a successful challenge to our registrations in the United States or other foreign countries may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications and registrations are intended to cover.\nWe also attempt to protect our intellectual property, including our trade secrets and know-how, through the use of trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as contractual provisions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent consultants. We also use non-disclosure agreements with other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information. Such measures, however, provide only limited protection, and we cannot be certain that our confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements will not be breached, especially after our employees or those of our CMs end their employment or engagement with us or with them, and that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or portions of our products, otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property, or may independently develop similar or equivalent trade secrets or know-how. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed or misappropriated, we could lose our competitive advantage and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially harmed.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation, unauthorized use, or other infringement of our intellectual property rights. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or other infringement in foreign countries where we have not applied for patent protections, and where effective patent, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as U.S. law.\nIn the future, we may need to take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology. Protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel, which could significantly harm our business. The availability of financial resources may limit our ability to commence or defend such litigation. In addition, we may not prevail in such proceedings. An adverse outcome of such proceedings may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be obligated to indemnify our customers and vendors for claims that our intellectual property infringes the rights of others, which may result in substantial expenses to us.\nWe may be required to indemnify our customers or vendors for intellectual property claims made against them for products incorporating our technology. As such, claims against our customers and vendors may require us to incur substantial expenses, such as legal expenses, damages for past infringement or royalties for future use. Future indemnity claims could adversely affect our business relationships and result in substantial costs to us.\nWe face certain litigation risks that could harm our business.\nWe may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. The results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Moreover, complaints that may be filed against us may not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek, and we therefore may be unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us. If any litigation is resolved against us, we could be subject to substantial damages. Thus, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more lawsuits may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even if litigation is not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved lawsuits could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and reputation. Litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations.\nOur costs of defending litigation have been significant in the past, may continue to be costly, and may not be covered by our insurance policies. The defense of litigation could also result in diversion of our management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business.\nWe could be subject to legal consequences if we fail to comply with the Modified Partial Final Award issued in connection with the Phoenix legal proceedings.\nIn the Interim Award incorporated by reference into the Modified Partial Final Award (in each case as defined in the disclosures under the caption \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements), the arbitrator determined and ordered that we are is required to pay Phoenix a royalty of 7.5% of the sale price on (i) future customer payments for certain of our product contracts previously entered into at the time the Interim Award was issued and (ii) customer payments for future sales of any product using any Deemed Trade Secret (as defined in the disclosures under the caption \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements), in each case payable in a single lump sum within one month of completion of the calendar quarter in which payment has been received from the customer, and we are required to concurrently submit to Phoenix a written report that sets forth the calculation of the amount of the royalty payment in a form similar to previous royalty reports, provided that following the first $1.0 million of royalty payments on our EMP-1 product only, inclusive of payments made to date, we are required to pay to Phoenix a royalty of 2.25% of the sale price (net of any warranty work, returns, rebates, discounts or credits) with respect to subsequent sales of our EMP-1 product. We are required to continue to make royalty payments in this manner until such time as we have in good faith determined, and can so document, that we have completely ceased use of the Deemed Trade Secrets, and must provide notice of this determination to Phoenix. It is possible that additional legal proceedings will follow if we attempt to provide this notice to Phoenix, which would require us to incur additional costs and divert management\u2019s attention. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could be subject to additional claims, penalties or judgments, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be subject to significant legal costs and expenses in connection with the interpretation of certain of the obligations pursuant to the Interim Award, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or security breach of our information technology infrastructure.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. We are constantly updating our information technology infrastructure. Although we have a disaster recovery plan, any failure to manage, expand, and update our information technology infrastructure or any failure in the operation of this infrastructure could harm our business.\nThe secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. Despite our implementation of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, unauthorized access, including impersonation of unauthorized users, efforts to discover and exploit any security vulnerabilities or securities weaknesses, and other similar disruptions. These types of attacks have increased, in general, as more businesses implement remote working environments. Our business is also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as intentional and unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges. Our customers\u2019 network and storage applications may be subject to similar disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. Data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information, employee information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property, trade secrets and other sensitive business information, any of which could result in legal action against us, exposure of our intellectual property to our competitors, damages, fines and other adverse effects. A data security breach could also lead to public exposure of personal information of our employees, customers and others. Any such theft, loss or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims.\nCyber attacks, such as computer viruses or other forms of cyber terrorism, may disrupt access to our network or storage applications. Such disruptions could result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or delays or interruptions in the production or shipment of our products. Data security breaches involving our data center customers could affect their financial condition and ability to continue to purchase our products. In addition, cyber attacks may cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.\nIn addition, our technology infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss and telecommunications failures. Further, our products contain sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that may contain security problems, security vulnerabilities, or defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our technology infrastructure, systems or data or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information or sensitive or personal information, it could harm our relationships with customers and other third parties and damage our brand and reputation and our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.\nThe theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance regulatory environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others or cause us to incur penalties or other significant legal liability or change our business practices.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation\nWe could be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we fail to comply with applicable export control laws and regulations.\nExports of certain of our products are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. government and administered by the United States Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. For products subject to the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, administered by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user and whether a license exception might apply. Virtually all exports of products subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, administered by the Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license.\nObtaining necessary export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses could significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could be subject to investigation and potential regulatory consequences, including, but not limited to, a no-action letter, monetary penalties, debarment from government contracting or denial of export privileges and criminal sanctions, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Compliance with U.S. government regulations may also subject us to significant fees and expenses, including legal expenses, and require us to expend significant time and resources. Finally, the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position.\nFor a portion of our business, we are subject to extensive government regulation, and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to penalties that may restrict our ability to conduct our business.\nAs a contractor and/or subcontractor to the U.S. government, we are subject to and must comply with various government regulations that impact our revenue, operating costs, profit margins and the internal organization and operation of our business. The most significant regulations and regulatory authorities affecting the portion of our business related to U.S. government contracts include the following:\n\u2022 the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and other supplemental agency regulations, which comprehensively regulate the formation and administration of, and performance under, U.S. government contracts;\n\u2022 the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all factual cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n\u2022 the False Claims Act and the False Statements Act, which impose penalties for payments made on the basis of false facts provided to the government and on the basis of false statements made to the government, respectively; and\n\u2022 the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from providing anything of value to a foreign official to help obtain, retain or direct business, or obtain any unfair advantage.\nOur failure to comply with applicable regulations, rules and approvals, or misconduct by any of our employees, could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the loss of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government generally, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are also subject to certain regulations of comparable government agencies in other countries, and our failure to comply with these non-U.S. regulations could also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business related to government contracts subjects us to additional risks.\nWe believe that the growth of our Navigation and Inertial Sensing product line business for the foreseeable future will depend, to a certain degree, on our ability to win government contracts and subcontracts, in particular from the Department of Defense. Many of our government customers are subject to budgetary constraints and our continued performance under these contracts or subcontracts, or award of additional contracts or subcontracts from these agencies, could be jeopardized by spending reductions, including constraints on government spending imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and its subsequent amendments, budget cutbacks at these agencies or government shutdowns. The funding of U.S. government programs is uncertain and dependent on continued congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds based on an annual budgeting process. We cannot be certain that current levels of congressional funding for our products and services will continue and that our business related to these products will not decline or increase at currently anticipated levels, or that we will not be subject to delays in the negotiation of contracts or increased costs due to changes in the funding of U.S. government programs or government shutdowns. A significant decline in government expenditures generally, or with respect to programs for which we provide products, could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nIn addition, our business could be adversely affected by a negative audit or investigation by the U.S. government. U.S. government agencies, primarily the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. These agencies also may review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, quality, accounting, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific cost reimbursement contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If an audit or investigation of our business were to uncover improper or\nillegal activities, then we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We could experience serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety or illegal acts were made against us, even if the allegations were inaccurate. In addition, responding to governmental audits or investigations may involve significant expense and divert management attention. Moreover, if any of our administrative processes and business systems are found not to comply with the applicable requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny or required to obtain additional governmental approvals that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nThe costs of compliance with state, federal and international legal and regulatory requirements, such as environmental, labor, trade and tax regulations, and customers' standards of corporate citizenship could cause an increase in our operating costs.\nWe are subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and must obtain certain permits and licenses relating to the use of hazardous materials in our production activities. If our control systems are unsuccessful in preventing a release of these materials into the environment or other adverse environmental conditions or human exposure occurs, we could experience interruptions in our operations and incur substantial remediation and other costs or liabilities. We are also subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements and other related state regulations, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if we are subjected to significant penalties, fines or compliance costs. In addition, certain foreign laws and regulations place restrictions on the concentration of certain hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, lead, mercury, and cadmium, in our products. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities or result in the limitation or suspension of the sale or production of our products. These regulations include the European Union's (\u201cEU\u201d) Restrictions on Hazardous Substances and Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations may limit our ability to export products to the EU and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we purchase certain chemicals from Europe and Asia that are unique, nearing the end of life and could be subject to future changes to environmental regulations in the country of origin and/or the U.S. In the event new restrictions are placed on any such chemicals, they may be difficult to replace, and may require us to re-design or re-validate existing products that use such chemicals in their production.\nIn connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations, as well as our compliance with industry environmental initiatives, the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers, and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business, we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations. In addition, in recent years, there has been increased media scrutiny and associated reports focusing on a potential link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments and certain illnesses, primarily different types of cancers. Regulatory agencies and industry associations have begun to study the issue to see if any actual correlation exists. Because we utilize clean rooms, we may become subject to liability claims. These reports may also affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. If we were found to be in violation of environmental and safety regulations laws or noncompliance with industry initiatives or standards of conduct, we could be subject to government fines or liabilities owed to our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, climate change is a significant topic of discussion and potential regulatory activity and has generated and may continue to generate federal or other regulatory responses in the near future. If we or our component suppliers fail to timely comply with applicable legislation, our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes, fines or penalties, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Department of Homeland Security has commenced a program to evaluate the security of certain chemicals which may be of interest to terrorists, including chemicals utilized by us. This evaluation may lead to regulations or restrictions affecting our ability to utilize these chemicals or the costs of doing so.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the FCPA. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits, along with various other anticorruption laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject, we cannot be certain that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire.\nWe have manufacturing operations in China and other jurisdictions, many of which pose elevated risks of anti-corruption violations, and we export our products for sale internationally. This puts us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered \u201cforeign officials\u201d under the FCPA, resulting in an elevated risk of potential FCPA violations. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anticorruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we identify deficiencies in our current system of internal controls or fail to remediate them, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, our business could be harmed and current and potential investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our equity securities.\nWe are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses or other lesser deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. If we cannot provide reliable and timely financial reports, our brand, operating results, and the market value of our equity securities could be harmed. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal controls that need improvement.\nWe have devoted significant resources to remediate and improve our internal controls. We have also been monitoring the effectiveness of these remediated measures. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nInadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our equity securities. Further, the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers, which could harm our business.\nWe could be required to record an impairment charge as a result of changes to assumptions used in our impairment testing.\nWe have substantial long-lived assets recorded on our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2020, we had $21.1 million of property, plant and equipment, net, on our consolidated balance sheet. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our business operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge related to these assets, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Future events and changes in market conditions, underlying business operations, competition or technologies may impact our assumptions as to prices, costs, holding periods, or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows. Although we believe the assumptions we used in testing for impairment are reasonable, we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment on an ongoing basis, and significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result. In such a circumstance, we may incur substantial impairment charges, which would adversely affect our financial results. In any period where our stock price, as determined by our market capitalization, is less than our book value, this too could indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) could have a material effect on our balance sheet, revenue and result of operations, and could require a significant expenditure of time, attention and resources, especially by senior management.\nOur accounting and financial reporting policies conform to U.S. GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB and the SEC and our independent registered public accounting firm. Such new financial accounting standards may result in significant changes that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires all operating leases with lease terms longer than twelve months be recorded as lease assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Implementing changes required by new standards, requirements or laws likely will require a significant expenditure of time, attention and resources. It is impossible to completely predict the impact, if any, on us of future changes to accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance requirements.\nRefer to Note 1 - Description of Business, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these new accounting standards, including the implementation status and potential impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nCompliance with regulations related to conflict minerals and other regulations with respect to our supply chains\ncould increase costs and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.\nPublic companies are required to disclose the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (collectively, \u201cconflict minerals\u201d) mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (the \u201ccovered countries\u201d) if a conflict mineral(s) is necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by us. We may determine, as part of our compliance efforts, that certain products or components we obtain from our suppliers contain conflict minerals. If we are unable to conclude that all our products are free from conflict minerals originating from covered countries, this could have a negative impact on our business, reputation and/or results of operations. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that our products be certified as conflict free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to substantiate such a claim. Compliance with these rules could also affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals used in the manufacture of products or components we obtain from our suppliers, including our ability to obtain products or components in sufficient quantities and/or at competitive prices. Certain of our customers are requiring additional information from us regarding the origin of our raw materials, and complying with these customer requirements may cause us to incur additional costs, such as costs related\nto determining the origin of any minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products.\nIn addition, the U.S. federal government has issued new policies for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking, and the United Kingdom and the State of California have issued laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. Several customers, as well as the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, have also issued expectations to eliminate these practices that may impact us. While we have a policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. We may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor\u2019s product.\nOur Paycheck Protection Program loan may not be forgiven and could subject us to enhanced scrutiny.\nOn May 3, 2020, we entered into a Paycheck Protection Program Promissory Note and Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act to receive loan proceeds of approximately $6.5 million, which we received on May 6, 2020. The PPP was implemented hastily in response to the unprecedented economic downturn related to COVID-19, and provides for loans of up to $10 million for eligible small businesses. Due to the speed of implementation of this program, official guidance and interpretations of the requirements of the program have been limited and have changed over time. On April 29, 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury updated its \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d document regarding the PPP program to indicate its intention to review all loans obtained under the program that exceed $2 million. We have diligently considered all known guidance and determined that we meet all requirements for the program. However, we cannot predict with certainty how such a review might be conducted or what new information or interpretations might emerge prior to the completion of the review. As such, we cannot be certain whether our loan may be forgiven, even if we meet the currently understood requirements for forgiveness. The review could also subject us to additional scrutiny, which could adversely affect business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may undergo an \"ownership change\" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, which could affect our ability to offset U.S. federal income tax against our net operating losses and certain of our tax credit carryovers.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating losses and tax credits (the \u201cTax Benefits\u201d) existing as of the date of such ownership change. Under the rules, such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of a company's stock within a rolling three-year period. The rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among shareholders considered by the rules as owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company.\nIf we were to undergo one or more \"ownership changes\" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, our net operating losses and certain of our tax credits existing as of the date of each ownership change may be unavailable, in whole or in part, to offset U.S. federal income tax resulting from our operations or any gains from the disposition of any of our assets and/or business, which could result in increased U.S. federal income tax liability.\nCertain provisions of New Jersey law and our governing documents may make a takeover of our Company difficult even if such takeover could be beneficial to some of our shareholders.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents and New Jersey law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022 provide that directors may be removed at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors cast at a meeting of shareholders called for that purpose;\n\u2022 provide that a supermajority vote of our shareholders is required to amend some portions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, including requiring approval by the holders of 80% or more of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors for certain business combinations unless these transactions meet certain fair price criteria and procedural requirements or are approved by two-thirds of our continuing directors;\n\u2022 authorize the issuance of preferred stock, without any requirement of vote or class vote of shareholders, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which shares of preferred stock may have rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022 limit the persons who can call special shareholder meetings; shareholders do not have authority to call a special meeting of shareholders;\n\u2022 establish advance notice requirements that must be complied with by shareholders to nominate persons for election to our Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022 do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022 provide for the filling of vacancies on our Board of Directors by action of 66 2/3% of the directors and not by the shareholders.\nThese and other provisions in our organizational documents could allow our Board of Directors to affect the rights of our shareholders in a number of ways, including making it difficult for shareholders to replace members of the Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for approving the appointment of members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace the current management team. These provisions could also limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. We may in the future adopt other measures that may have the effect of delaying or discouraging an unsolicited takeover, even if the takeover were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated shareholders. Certain of these measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by our shareholders and this could depress the price of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business and results of operations may continue to be negatively impacted by general economic and financial market conditions and market conditions in the industries in which we operate, and such conditions may increase the other risks that affect our business.\nIn recent years, and particularly in 2020 with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the world\u2019s financial markets have experienced significant turmoil, resulting in reductions in available credit, increased costs of credit, extreme volatility in security prices, potential changes to existing credit terms, and rating downgrades of investments. These conditions\nmaterially and adversely affected the market conditions in the industries in which we operate and caused many of our customers to reduce their spending plans, leading them to draw down their existing inventory and reduce orders for our products, which, in turn, had an adverse impact on our revenues. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, worldwide or within our industries. It is possible that economic conditions could result in further setbacks, and that these customers, or others, could as a result significantly reduce their capital expenditures, draw down their inventories, reduce production levels of existing products, defer introduction of new products or place orders and accept delivery for products for which they do not pay us due to their economic difficulties or other reasons. If any of these events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events could have an adverse effect on our business.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and floods, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our facilities, the temporary closure of one or more of our facilities or those of our suppliers, a temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, a temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, a temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, and delays in the delivery of goods. Public health issues, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have an adverse impact on customer demand. As a result of any of these events, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers. Although we maintain business interruption insurance and other insurance intended to cover some of these risks, such insurance may be inadequate, whether because of coverage amount, policy limitations, the financial viability of the insurance companies issuing such policies, or other reasons.\nThe market price for our common stock has experienced significant price and volume volatility and is likely to continue to experience significant volatility in the future. This volatility may impair our ability to finance strategic transactions with our stock and otherwise harm our business.\nOur stock price has experienced significant price and volume volatility for the past several years, and our stock price is likely to experience significant volatility in the future. The trading price of our common stock may be influenced by factors beyond our control, such as the volatility of the financial markets, uncertainty surrounding domestic and foreign economies, conditions and trends in the markets we serve, changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets, publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts relating to our business, the business of our competitors or the industries in which we operate and compete, changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors, legislation or regulatory policies, practices, or actions, sales of our common stock by our principal shareholders, and the trading volume of our common stock. The historical market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of our common stock. We have historically used equity incentive compensation as part of our overall compensation arrangements. The effectiveness of equity incentive compensation in retaining key employees may be adversely impacted by volatility in our stock price. Significant declines in our stock price may also interfere with our ability, if needed, to raise additional funds through equity financing or to finance strategic transactions with our stock. In addition, there may be increased risk of securities litigation following periods of fluctuations in our stock price. Securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. These and other consequences of volatility in our stock price which could be exacerbated by macroeconomic conditions that affect the market generally, or our industries in particular, could have the effect of diverting management's attention and could materially harm our business.\nWe may not pay additional dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investment in our common stock may be an increase in the price of our common stock.\nAlthough we paid a special dividend in 2016, we may not pay additional dividends in the future. In addition, the terms of our loan and security agreement with our financial institution restrict our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investment in our common stock may be an increase in the price of our common stock. There is no guarantee that the market price of our common stock will increase or ever exceed the price that you paid for your shares of our common stock.\n***\nThe risks above are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in our risk factors actually occur, or if additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, materialize, then our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected.", "PERMNO": 84607, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "EMKR"}
