Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including those described below.\nOur Development Activities Have Not Generated Significant Revenues\nAt present, our development activities include water resource and agricultural development at our San Bernardino County properties. We have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date and we do not know when, if ever, we will receive operating revenues sufficient to offset the costs of our development activities. As a result, we continue to incur a net loss from operations.\nWe May Never Generate Significant Revenues or Become Profitable Unless We Are Able to Successfully Implement Programs to Develop Our Land Assets and Related Water Resources\nWe do not know the terms, if any, upon which we may be able to proceed with our water and other development programs. Regardless of the form of our water development programs, the circumstances under which supplies or storage of water can be developed and the profitability of any supply or storage project are subject to significant uncertainties, including the risk of variable water supplies and changing water allocation priorities. Additional risks include our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and permits, litigation by environmental or other groups, unforeseen technical difficulties, general market conditions for water supplies, and the time needed to generate significant operating revenues from such programs after operations commence.\nThe Development of Our Properties Is Heavily Regulated, Requires Governmental Approvals and Permits That Could Be Denied, and May Have Competing Governmental Interests and Objectives\nIn developing our land assets and related water resources, we are subject to local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, resource protection, environmental impacts, infrastructure design, subdivision of land, construction and similar matters. Our development activities are subject to the risk of adverse interpretations or changes to U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies. Further, our development activities require governmental approvals and permits. If such permits were to be denied or granted subject to unfavorable conditions or restrictions, our ability to successfully implement our development programs would be adversely impacted.\nPrior to construction of the Water Project, terms for moving water supplies in the Colorado River Aqueduct must be negotiated with Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (\"Metropolitan\"), which owns and controls the CRA. Water Project supplies entering the CRA will comply with Metropolitan's published engineering, design and water quality standards and will be subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by Metropolitan for the conveyance of water within its service territory. The Metropolitan Board must consider and approve the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA to transport water to its participating agencies. The Project has not yet filed an application for access to the CRA at Metropolitan, but we expect such a formal application may be filed in 2019 as the Project's contractual arrangements with participants are finalized.\nBeginning in 2017, the Company's activities have also been the target of state legislation and state administrative communications that could ultimately result in additional permitting and review requirements for the Water Project. In the 2017 - 2018 session, the Legislature considered Assembly Bill 1000 (\"AB 1000\") and Senate Bill 120 (\"SB 120\"), bills that would have created new review requirements prior to the conveyance of groundwater from groundwater basins in the California desert within California's public water transportation facilities, including the CRA. Both AB 1000 and SB 120 were held on the suspense file by the California Senate Committee on Appropriations, stopping the bills from further consideration by the Legislature in the 2017 - 2018 session. On February 15, 2019, Senate Bill 307 (\"SB 307\") was introduced in Legislature prior to the close of the bill introduction deadline for the 2019 - 2020 session. The text of SB 307 is identical to 2018's SB 120 and seeks to create new review requirements prior to the conveyance of groundwater from desert groundwater basins within California's public water transportation facilities. We cannot be certain whether SB 307 would ever be adopted and, if so, to what extent SB 307 would affect the permitting requirements for the Project.\nIn October 2017, we received a letter from the California State Lands Commission (\"Commission\") advising that the Commission recently determined for the first time that the State of California owns \"in fee\" a 200-foot-wide, 1-mile long strip of land beneath the existing Arizona and California Railroad (\"ARZC\") right-of-way within which we plan to construct the Water Project's conveyance pipeline. The Commission letter asserts that if the Company intends to cross the parcel, we would require a lease from the Commission subject to additional environmental review. We cannot predict with certainty at this time whether a lease from the Commission will be required or pursued, as the Company already holds a lease from the ARZC to access its right-of-way over this parcel.\nIn December 2018, we received a letter from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (\"CDFW\") related to permits that the Water Project must secure under CDFW's Land and Streambed Alteration (\"LSA\") program prior to construction of the Project's 43-mile conveyance pipeline. The letter described ongoing study of springs in the watershed surrounding the project area and asserts that further environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act (\"CEQA\") may be required prior to processing of the LSA permit applications. The CDFW review of LSA permits is to be confined to localized plans within ephemeral streambeds along the pipeline route, not springs, which is a matter in the purview of the CEQA Lead Agency and the County of San Bernardino, a CEQA Responsible Agency with an oversight role over groundwater in the Project area. The letter has been provided to the Lead Agency and the County for review. We cannot predict with certainty at this time whether further environmental review will be required or pursued.\nFinally, the statutes, regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge proposed plans and approvals. Opposition from third parties will cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely. While we have worked with representatives of various environmental and third-party interests and agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects, certain groups may remain opposed to our development plans and pursue legal action. In 2018, the Center for Biological Diversity (\"CBD\") and National Parks Conservation Association (\"NPCA\") filed lawsuits against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") and others challenging BLM's determination that the Company's use of the ARZC right-of-way from the ARZC for a pipeline and related facilities may proceed without additional permitting from the BLM. In 2018, we intervened in the two consolidated federal court matters in order to protect our interests. Both matters are being heard jointly in U.S. Federal Court this summer. CBD and NPCA have filed previous unsuccessful actions against the Company and the Water Project; however, we cannot predict what impact, if any, this current lawsuit may have on the Company or Water Project.\nOur Failure to Make Timely Payments of Principal and Interest on Our Indebtedness or To Obtain Additional Financing Will Impact our Ability to Implement Our Asset Development Programs\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total indebtedness outstanding to our lenders of approximately $139.3 million. Approximately $66.1 million of our indebtedness is secured by our assets and is due in May 2021 (see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\"). To the extent that we do not make principal and interest payments on the indebtedness when due, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of agreements governing our indebtedness, we may default on our obligations. Additionally, the Company has principal and interest payments aggregating to approximately $79.6 million coming due in March 2020 related to its 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes (\"Convertible Senior Notes\") to the extent the noteholders, who have the right to convert at any time into the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of $6.75 per share, do not convert prior to March 2020 or if we do not exercise the options we have with parties holding 95% of our Convertible Senior Notes that allow us, at our sole option, at any time prior to December 5, 2019, to extend the maturity of the Convertible Senior Notes to September 5, 2021 (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Subsequent Events\"). The Company's Senior Secured Debt of approximately $66.1 million as of December 31, 2018, could also become due as early as December 2019, if we have not exercised the option agreements or the Convertible Senior Notes have not been converted by that time and the Company's stock price is less than 120% of the conversion rate and according to terms of the debt agreement (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Long-Term Debt and Lease Obligation\"). Additionally, the completion of the acquisition of the 124-mile extension of our Northern Pipeline will require an $18 million payment within thirty days of satisfaction of certain conditions precedent under our purchase agreement with EPNG. We do not currently have the cash resources on hand to make this payment in full.\nWe will continue to require additional working capital to meet our cash resource needs until such time as our asset development programs, including the Water Project, produce revenues sufficient to fund operations. If we cannot raise funds if and when needed, we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company. We cannot assure you that our current lenders, or any other lenders, will give us additional credit should we seek it. If we are unable to obtain additional credit, we may engage in further financings. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on the status of our asset development programs and general conditions in the capital markets at the time funding is sought. Any further equity or convertible debt financings would result in the dilution of ownership interests of our current stockholders.\nThe Conversion of Our Outstanding Convertible Notes into Common Stock Would Dilute the Percentage of Our Common Stock Held by Current Stockholders\nIn connection with our March 2013 debt refinance (see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\"), we issued approximately $53.5 million in convertible notes, under which principal and accrued interest were convertible into common stock at $8.05 per share at the election of our noteholders prior to maturity in March 2018 (the \"2018 Convertible Notes\"). In December 2015, certain of the noteholders exchanged their 2018 Convertible Notes for Convertible Senior Notes under which principal and accrued interest can be converted into common stock at $6.75 per share at the election of the noteholders prior to a maturity date in March 2020. In April 2016, we issued an additional $8.0 million in original principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes. In March 2019, the Company entered into option agreements with parties holding 95% of our Convertible Senior Notes that allow us, at our sole option, at any time prior to December 5, 2019, to extend the maturity date of the Convertible Senior Notes to September 5, 2021. As of the date of filing of this annual report, our lenders have converted $12.857 million in original principal amount of the notes, leaving a balance of $48.613 million in original principal amount of these notes. An election by our lenders to convert all or a portion of principal and accrued interest under the Convertible Senior Notes into common stock will dilute the percentage of our common stock held by current stockholders up to 11.0 million shares as of the date of filing of this annual report, and up to an additional 0.8 million shares if held to maturity.\nThe Issuance of Equity Securities Under At Market Issuance Sales Agreements and Management Equity Incentive Plans Will Cause Dilution\nWe have and may continue to issue equity securities pursuant to at market issuance sales agreements. Further, our compensation programs for management emphasize long-term incentives, primarily through the issuance of equity securities and options to purchase equity securities. It is expected that plans involving the issuance of shares, options, or both will be submitted from time to time to our stockholders for approval. In the event that any such plans are approved and implemented, the issuance of shares and options under such plans may result in the dilution of the ownership interest of other stockholders and will, under currently applicable accounting rules, result in a charge to earnings based on the value of our common stock at the time of issue and the fair value of options at the time of their award. The expense would be recorded over the vesting period of each stock and option grant.\nThe Volatility of Our Stock Price Could Adversely Affect Current and Future Stockholders\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and fluctuates in response to various factors which are beyond our control. Such fluctuations are particularly common in companies such as ours, which have not generated significant revenues. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially:\n\u00b7\ndevelopments involving the execution of our business plan;\n\u00b7\ndisclosure of any adverse results in litigation;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments affecting our ability to develop our properties;\n\u00b7\nthe dilutive effect or perceived dilutive effect of additional debt or equity financings;\n\u00b7\nperceptions in the marketplace of our company and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock markets, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Price volatility could be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.", "PERMNO": 85570, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "CDZI"}
