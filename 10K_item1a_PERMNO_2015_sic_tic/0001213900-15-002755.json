{"cik": "1097792", "company": "DubLi, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are dependent upon our ability to raise capital to continue operations\nWe incurred losses for the period from our inception of our operations through September 30, 2012 and we experienced negative net cash flows from operating activities for fiscal years 2013 and 2014. As a result, our Company had stockholders\u2019 and working capital deficits of approximately $12 million and $13.5 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2014. We financed our operations in part during the year ended September 30, 2014 through (i) borrowings from our President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Hansen, amounting to approximately $1.5 million; (ii) proceeds from the sale of land in Dubai of approximately $0.8 million; and (iii) an unsecured loan in May 2014 from a private lender of $0.5 million.\nUntil such time as the cash inflows derived from our operations increase to the amounts necessary to cover our operating and other expenditures, we will remain dependent upon Mr. Hansen for any additional debt and/or equity capital to continue operations. However, we may not be able to obtain this additional capital when needed. We are not currently in compliance with the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and we will not be able to raise capital through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities to unrelated third parties until we are in compliance with such reporting requirements. Although we intend to become current with respect to our reporting obligations during fiscal 2015, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so. If we do become current with our reporting requirements and subsequently raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution in their ownership percentage of the Company.\nOur business model may not generate revenues sufficient to support our operations.\nSince the inception of our operations we have not generated sufficient revenues to fund our expenses and other cash outflows. Effective March 2013 we discontinued our online auctions program to focus solely on our DubLi.com business model, and all of our future revenues generation is dependent upon the success of this model which includes our membership subscription packages sold to customers who shop on our shopping malls to generate commission income. DubLi.com is a shopping portal that provides its members with cash back on any purchase of goods and services they make from the online retailers and online travel providers (\u201cMerchants\u201d) that are linked to the DubLi.com site. We offer both free memberships and paid memberships, whereby consumers that pay a subscription fee for Premium and V.I.P. membership receive a higher percentage of cash back reward from each purchase. Retailers and travel providers pay us commission income based on a percentage of each purchase made on their site by a DubLi.com member. Although we market directly to potential members, we rely primarily on our Business Associates network and Partner programs to generate members for our site, and we pay a commission based on customers\u2019 purchases to our Business Associates and Partner program sponsors.\nWe have not yet obtained enough members or facilitated enough purchase activity to generate net revenues (net of cash back to customers) and sales of corresponding advertising and marketing programs sufficient to support our operations. Furthermore our lack of liquidity has had an adverse impact on our Business Associates network and our ability to directly market to potential members, thereby reducing the effectiveness of these methods of obtaining new members.\nIf we are not able to significantly increase the membership of our DubLi.com site to generate revenues made through the site and sales of corresponding advertising and marketing programs, we may not be able to sustain our operations.\nIf we do not improve our internal controls and systems, our business may suffer and the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment may be harmed.\nAs a public company, we are required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires Management to assess annually the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act). During the course of our compliance testing, we identified certain material weaknesses in our system of internal controls and inaccuracies or deficiencies in our financial reporting. See Part II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on these identified weaknesses. We are taking remedial measures to correct such control deficiencies and expect to devote significant resources to improving our internal controls. These remedial measures include the measures discussed in Part II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K. We expect to continue to evaluate our controls and make improvements as necessary. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our controls will be adequate in the future or that the controls will be effective in preventing fraud or material misstatement. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, and fraud may be easier to perpetrate on us. Any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nOur success is dependent on the ability and productivity of our Business Associates.\nMost of our revenues are generated through the efforts of our network of Business Associates. To increase our revenues, we must increase the productivity of this network. Therefore, our success depends, in significant part, upon our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our Business Associates and their ability to expand their organization network and to generate customers to our Shopping Malls. Our operating results could be harmed if our existing and new business opportunities do not generate sufficient interest to retain and motivate existing Business Associates and attract new Business Associates; or if we fail to educate them about our products and services in ways that ensure their success or if we fail to properly support them in their efforts.\nThe primary way we recruit new Business Associates is through a network marketing strategy. The success of a network marketing force is highly dependent upon our ability to offer a commission structure and sales incentive program that enables our Business Associates to recruit and develop other Business Associates to create an organization. To compete with other network marketing organizations, we may be required to increase our cost of revenues and marketing costs through increases in commissions, sales incentives or other features, any of which could adversely impact our future earnings.\nWe may experience a high rate of turnover among Business Associates, which is a characteristic of the network marketing business. The loss of a significant number of Business Associates for any reason could negatively impact sales and could impair our ability to attract new Business Associates. In addition, the level of confidence of the Business Associates in our ability to perform is an important factor in maintaining and growing our Business Associate network. Adverse publicity or negative financial developments concerning the Company could adversely affect our ability to maintain the confidence of our Business Associates.\nOur Business Associates may not comply with our policies and procedures.\nOur Business Associates are independent contractors and, accordingly, we are not in a position to directly provide the same direction, motivation and oversight as we would if the Business Associates were employed by the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance that our Business Associates will participate in our marketing strategies or plans or comply with our Business Associate Policies and Procedures and Terms and Conditions.\nExtensive federal, state and local laws regulate our business and network marketing program. Because we conduct operations in foreign countries, our policies and procedures for our Business Associates may differ due to the different legal requirements of each country in which we do business. While we have implemented Business Associate policies and procedures designed to govern Business Associate conduct and to protect the goodwill associated with our trademarks and trade names, it can be difficult to enforce these policies and procedures because of the large number of Business Associates and their independent status. Violations by our independent Business Associates of applicable law or of our policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on our operations and harm our business reputation. In addition, it is possible that a court could hold us civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions of our independent Business Associates.\nWe face significant competition.\nWe face competition from competing products in each of our lines of business, in both the domestic and international markets. Globally, we compete against products sold to consumers by other direct marketing and sales companies and through the Internet, and against products sold through the mass market and prestige retail channels.\nWithin the direct selling channel, we compete on a regional and often country-by-country basis, with our direct marketing competitors. We compete within a distinct business model where providing a compelling earnings opportunity for our Business Associates is as critical as developing and marketing new and innovative products. Therefore, in contrast to a typical company which operates within a broad-based consumer pool, we must first compete for a limited pool of Business Associates before we reach the ultimate consumer.\nDirect sellers compete for representative or entrepreneurial talent by providing a more competitive earnings opportunity than that offered by the competition. Business Associates are attracted to a direct seller by competitive earnings opportunities, often through what are commonly known as \u201cfield incentives\u201d in the direct marketing industry such as awards of trips, cars or bonuses paid to the highest performers. Competitors devote substantial effort in finding out the effectiveness of such incentives so that they can invest in incentives that are the most cost effective or produce the better payback. As a result, we are subject to significant competition for the recruitment of Business Associates from other direct selling or network marketing organizations. It is therefore continually necessary to innovate and enhance our direct selling and service model as well as to recruit and retain new Business Associates. If we are unable to do so our business will be adversely affected.\nThe E-commerce marketplace is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. We compete with many competitors based on the type of merchandise and the sales format they offer to customers. Some competitors in the E-commerce marketplace focus primarily on excess and overstock products with fixed price formats while others may emerge with myriads of new and innovative models and strategy.\nWe believe our ability to effectively compete is contingent upon our ability to impact customer awareness of our service offerings, provide an enjoyable shopping experience and provide customers with an opportunity to purchase merchandise at a potential significant discount to prevailing market prices.\nMany of our potential competitors have significantly greater brand awareness and greater financial, marketing, customer support, technical and other resources than we have. We believe that there are only a limited number of factors that restrict or discourage competitors from seeking to directly compete with us.\nOur ability to conduct business, particularly in international markets, may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks.\nOur ability to capitalize on new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is exposed to risks associated with our international operations, including:\n\u25cf the possibility that a foreign government might ban or severely restrict our business method of direct selling, or that local civil unrest, political instability or changes in diplomatic or trade relationships might disrupt our operations in an international market;\n\u25cf the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas where we operate;\n\u25cf the possibility that a government authority might impose legal, tax or other financial burdens on our Business Associates, as direct sellers, or on DubLi, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets; and\n\u25cf the possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of our Business Associates as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on our Business Associates.\nWe are also subject to the interpretation and enforcement by governmental agencies of other foreign laws, rules, regulations or policies, including any changes thereto, such as restrictions on trade, import and export license requirements, privacy and data protection laws, and tariffs and taxes, which may require us to adjust our operations in certain markets where we do business. In addition, we face legal and regulatory risks in the United States and, in particular, cannot predict with certainty the outcome of various contingencies or the impact that pending or future legislative and regulatory changes may have on our business in the future. The FTC has proposed business opportunity regulations which may have an effect upon the Company\u2019s method of operating in the US. It is not possible to gauge what any final regulations may provide, their effective date or their impact at this time.\nWe may not be successful in developing brand awareness, which is critical to our business.\nWe believe that brand recognition is critical to our business. Development and awareness of our \u201cDubLi\u201d brand will depend largely on our ability to increase our Business Associate network and customer base. If Business Associates and consumers do not perceive us as offering an entertaining and/or efficient way to purchase merchandise, we may be unsuccessful in promoting and maintaining our brand. To promote our brand, we expect to continue to recruit new Business Associates, to incentivize existing Business Associates and to increase our marketing and advertising budgets. Since a significant percentage of our cost of revenues are commissions paid to our Business Associates, we anticipate that, relative to some of our competitors, a smaller percentage of our gross revenues will be available for marketing or promotional activities. Failure to successfully promote our brand in a cost effective manner could significantly harm our business and financial condition.\nCustomer complaints, negative publicity or our security measures could diminish use of our services.\nCustomer complaints, negative publicity or poor customer service, which is fairly common with any network marketing or Internet related business, could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services. If we fail to consistently promote the latest product offerings from the world\u2019s leading manufacturers or service providers, or if there are rumors, articles, reviews or blogs that indicate or suggest that we have failed to consistently promote such offerings, our revenues could decrease. Similarly, measures we take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security have the potential to damage relations with our customers or decrease activity on our sites by making our sites more difficult to use or restricting the activities of certain users. Negative publicity about, or negative experiences with, customer support for any of our business models could cause our reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in our brand as a whole.\nSystem failures could harm our business.\nWe have experienced short system failures from time to time, and any interruption in the availability of our web sites will reduce our current revenues and incomes, could harm our future revenues and incomes, and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny. Any unscheduled interruption in our services may result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands.\nAlthough our systems have been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences through worldwide redundant servers, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, and similar events. Our systems are also subject to hackings, break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. We do not carry business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.\nAny interruptions in Internet service could harm our business.\nOur customers rely on access to the Internet to access our products and services. Interference with our offerings or higher charges for access to our offerings, whether paid by us or by our customers, could cause us to lose existing customers, impair our ability to attract new customers, and harm our revenues and growth.\nThe success of our services also depends largely on the continued availability of the Internet infrastructure. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security, as well as timely development of complementary products, for providing reliable Internet access and services. The Internet has experienced significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic, a trend likely to continue. The Internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands. In addition, increasing numbers of users, increasing bandwidth requirements, or problems caused by \u201cviruses,\u201d \u201cworms,\u201d malware and similar programs may harm the performance of the Internet. The backbone computers of the Internet have been the targets of such programs. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage generally, as well as the level of usage of our services.\nWe face risks in connection with our relationships with our credit card processors.\nWe currently have agreements in place with credit card processors in the United States and Europe which process the credit card transactions completed on our websites. Pursuant to the current terms and conditions of these agreements, the processors are permitted to maintain a certain percentage of reserve or holdback for a certain period on each sale processed by them. Holdbacks are the portion of the revenues from a credit card transaction that is held in reserve by the credit card processor to cover possible disputed charges, chargeback fees, and other expenses. In the event a credit card processor declares bankruptcy, encounters financial difficulties, refuses or fails to honor its contract with us for any reason or ceases operations, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access funds due to us on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, from time to time, these processors may increase the amount that they keep in reserve as holdbacks. Although we are entitled to receive any remaining holdback amount after a designated period of time, any increase in the holdback percentage would result in a delay in our receiving the full proceeds from the sales of our products. This would adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition.\nOur ability to develop successful web site enhancements and new service offerings are a significant component of our business strategy.\nWe are in the process of developing a new platform of web sites to better provide DubLi.com shoppers with an enjoyable experience. We are also contemporaneously seeking to expand our service offering to a wide range of entertainment products and services. Our ability to succeed in these new offerings may require significant resources and Management attention. The success of new and enhanced offering introductions depend on several factors, including our ability to develop and complete these offerings in a timely manner, successfully promote the offerings, manage the risks associated with the offerings, make sufficient resources available to support them, secure appropriate intellectual property rights and address any quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Despite the allocation of resources, there can be no assurance that the new offerings will be developed successfully or accepted by our customers.\nOur network marketing program could be found to be not in compliance with current or newly adopted laws or regulations in one or more markets.\nOur network marketing program is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the FTC and various state agencies in the United States, as well as regulations on direct selling in foreign markets administered by foreign agencies. We are subject to the risk that, in one or more markets, our network marketing program could be found not in compliance with applicable law or regulations. Regulations applicable to network marketing organizations generally are directed at preventing fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as \u201cpyramid\u201d or \u201cchain sales\u201d schemes, by ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within an organization is based on sales of the organization\u2019s products rather than investments in the organization or other non-retail sales-related criteria. The regulatory requirements concerning network marketing programs do not include \u201cbright line\u201d rules and are inherently fact-based, and thus, even in jurisdictions where we believe that our network marketing program is in full compliance with applicable laws or regulations governing network marketing systems, we are subject to the risk that these laws or regulations or the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by governmental agencies or courts can change. The failure of our network marketing program to comply with current or newly adopted regulations could negatively impact our business in a particular market or in general.\nNew and existing regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to foreign and domestic laws regulating the conduct of business on and off the Internet. It is not always clear how existing laws governing issues such as gaming, multi-level marketing, wire transfers, property ownership, and certain intellectual property issues and distribution controls, taxation, libel and defamation, and personal privacy apply to online businesses such as ours. The majority of these laws was adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and E-commerce and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and E-commerce. Those laws that do reference the Internet, such as the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the European Union\u2019s Directives on Distance Selling and Electronic Commerce, are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. Furthermore, as our activities and the types of goods and services listed on our websites expand regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are subject to licensure or prohibition from conducting our business in their jurisdiction, either generally or with respect to certain actions (e.g., the sale of real estate, event tickets, cultural goods, boats and automobiles).\nAs we expand and localize our international activities, we become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers or one or more of our users, or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an E-commerce transaction. Laws regulating Internet and E-commerce companies outside of the US may be less favorable than those in the US, giving greater rights to consumers, competitors or users. Compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings, and the imposition of any regulations on our users may harm our business. In addition, we may be subject to overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us. Our failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover any eventual asset or business loss\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future. Although we have all-risk property insurance for our operating properties covering damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters or certain acts of terrorism), each policy has certain exclusions. In addition, our property insurance coverage may be less than the expected full replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there were a total loss. Our level of insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all possible losses in the event of a major casualty. Certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, loss of income, or damage resulting from deterioration or corrosion, insects or animals and pollution, might not be covered under our policies. Therefore, certain acts and events could expose us to substantial uninsured losses. In addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties who were injured or harmed. While we do carry general liability insurance, we do not carry business interruption insurance. The insurance we do carry may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and, in any event, may not be adequate to cover all losses.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nA substantial portion of our revenues are generated in currencies other than the US dollar, and as we report our financial results in US dollars, we may face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. If the US dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in decreased revenues and income. We are also subject to currency exchange risks in connection with our purchase and sale of US$ and \u20ac in the ordinary course of our business to meet our obligations to our Business Associates, other vendors and creditors.\nWe face risks associated with our international operations.\nOur international expansion has been rapid and our international business, especially in Europe, is critical to our revenues and income. For the current and previous financial years, our net revenues were derived substantially outside the US. Expansion into international markets requires Management attention and resources and requires us to localize our services to conform to local laws, cultures, standards, and policies. The commercial, Internet, and transportation infrastructure in lesser-developed countries may make it more difficult for us to replicate our business model. In many countries, we compete with local companies that understand the local market better than we do, and we may not benefit from first-to-market advantages. We may not be successful in expanding into new international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations.\nAs we continue to expand internationally through the expansion of our network marketing model and Shopping Malls, we are increasingly subject to risks of doing business internationally, which include:\n\u25cf strong competitors;\n\u25cf regulatory requirements including regulation of Internet services, communications, professional selling, distance selling, privacy and data protection, banking and money transmitting, that may limit or prevent the offering of our services in some jurisdictions, prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers, prohibit the listing of certain categories of goods, require product changes, require special licensure, subject us to various taxes, penalties or audits, or limit the transfer of information between us and our Business Associates, partners, customers and participating merchants on our Shopping Malls;\n\u25cf laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit foreign ownership of certain businesses;\n\u25cf difficulties in integrating with local payment providers, including banks, credit and debit card networks, and electronic fund transfer systems or with the local telecommunications infrastructure;\n\u25cf differing levels of retail distribution, shipping, communications, and Internet infrastructures;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax consequences, including local taxation of our fees or of transactions on our websites;\n\u25cf higher telecommunications and Internet service provider costs;\n\u25cf different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws;\n\u25cf expenses associated with localizing our products, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency;\n\u25cf profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions, and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf volatility in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political, economic or military conditions;\n\u25cf challenges associated with maintaining relationships with local law enforcement and related agencies;\n\u25cf interrupted or prohibited operations in jurisdictions whereby a potential violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could occur; and\n\u25cf varying intellectual property laws.\nSome of these factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs. As we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies, we also could become subject to increased difficulties in monetizing revenues into cash, repatriating money without adverse tax consequences, and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations has been discussed in more detail under the caption \u201cWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates,\u201d above.\nWe conduct certain functions, including product development, customer support and other operations, in regions outside the US. We are subject to both US and local laws and regulations applicable to our offshore activities, and any factors which reduce the anticipated benefits associated with providing these functions outside of the US, including cost efficiencies and productivity improvements could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be liable if third parties misappropriate our customers\u2019 personal information.\nIf third parties are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate our customers\u2019 personal information or credit card information, or if we give third parties improper access to our customers\u2019 personal information or credit card information, we could be subject to liability. This liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. This liability could also include claims for other misuse of personal information, including unauthorized marketing purposes. Any of these claims could result in litigation. Liability for misappropriation of this information could adversely affect our business. In addition, the FTC and state agencies have been investigating various Internet companies regarding their use of personal information. We could incur additional expenses from the introduction of new regulations regarding the use of personal information or from government agencies investigating our privacy practices.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, such as customer credit card numbers. We cannot assure you that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect customer transaction data. If any such compromise of our security were to occur, it could harm our reputation, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. A party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. We cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent such security breaches will not harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to protect our proprietary technology adequately could adversely affect our business.\nOur proprietary technology is one of the keys to our performance and ability to remain competitive. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We also use technical measures, confidentiality agreements and non-compete agreements to protect our proprietary rights. Although we believe that our DubLi trade name and our logo have certain intellectual property protections, our competitors or others could adopt product or service names similar to \u201cDubLi\u201d or our other service marks or trademarks. Any of the foregoing might impede our ability to build brand identity and could lead to customer confusion. Our inability to protect our service mark or trademarks adequately could adversely affect our business and financial condition, and the value of our brand name and other intangible assets.\nAll the software that we use to provide our services was specifically developed by DubLi and, accordingly, we believe we have certain proprietary rights to the software. We rely on copyright laws to protect our proprietary software and trade secret laws to protect the source code for our proprietary software. We generally enter into agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. The steps we take to protect our proprietary information may not prevent misappropriation of our technology, and the agreements we enter into for that purpose might not be enforceable. A third party might obtain and use our software or other proprietary information without authorization or develop similar software independently. It is difficult for us to police the unauthorized use of our technology, particularly because the global nature of the Internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of software or other transmitted data. The laws of other countries may not provide us with adequate or effective protection of our intellectual property.\nIf we were to lose the services of our President and Chief Executive Officer, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur future success depends on a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior Management team. In particular, our President and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), Michael Hansen is critical to the overall management of the Company and the development of our business plan, culture and strategic direction. The loss of Mr. Hansen or any of our key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nWe are significantly influenced by one stockholder who controls a voting majority of our common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2014, Mr. Hansen holds approximately 79.8 million shares of common stock and 185,000 shares of Super Voting Preferred Stock entitled to 2,000 votes per share, collectively representing approximately 56% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding voting securities. Accordingly, Mr. Hansen has the power to influence or control the outcome of important corporate decisions or matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Although Mr. Hansen owes the Company certain fiduciary duties as an executive officer and a director of the Company, the interests of Mr. Hansen may conflict with, or differ from, the interests of other holders of our common stock. For example, Mr. Hansen could unilaterally decide to replace our existing Board of Directors even if such change was not supported by most of the other stockholders. So long as Mr. Hansen has the power to vote a majority of shares of our voting securities, he will have the power to significantly influence and/or control all our corporate decisions and will be able to effect or inhibit changes in control of the Company.\nOther factors might inhibit changes in control of the Company\nIn addition to the items referenced in the preceding paragraph, our Board of Directors has the power or could secure the power (pursuant to a stockholder consent process that Mr. Hansen could control) to issue additional shares of preferred stock which could prevent or discourage a change in control of the Company when it is deemed desirable by beneficial stockholders other than Mr. Hansen. The power to issue additional shares of preferred stock or common stock could, in some situations, have the effect of discouraging and/or rendering more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or any other attempt to obtain control of the Company. This may limit the opportunity for stockholders to dispose of their shares at the higher price generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal.\nAcquisitions and joint ventures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses in the past, including, most recently, our merger of DubLi and CG Holdings and its subsidiaries. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky. The areas where we may face difficulties include:\n\u25cf diversion of Management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration, particularly given the varying scope of our recent acquisitions;\n\u25cf declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in, or acceleration of, compensation, or changes in Management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the business;\n\u25cf the need to integrate each company\u2019s accounting, management, information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;\n\u25cf the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cf in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u25cf in some cases, the need to transition operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms; and\n\u25cf liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities.\nMoreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions, or may not realize them in the expected time frame. Future acquisitions or mergers may require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business. To the extent we have sufficient authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock, we may not need to secure stockholder approval prior to making any equity issuances for such purposes.\nIn addition, we may make certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and lack management and operational control. These investments may involve risks. For example, the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with our business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture.\nOur search for acquisitions and joint ventures could result in the diversion or loss of resources and litigation risk.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets. At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of locating and evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures can be time consuming, difficult and expensive. In addition, the Company may be subject to various risks and business restrictions as it agrees to enter into non-disclosure agreements, letters of intent or memorandums of understanding in an effort to further explore potential transactions. Even if the Company enters into more definitive agreements with respect to a prospective transaction, the Company and any counter-parties to the transaction may, under certain circumstances, elect or determine not to proceed. Accordingly, there is also no assurance that the Company will ever recoup any of its investments or expenditures with respect to any targeted transaction.\nOur business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes.\nThe application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d), goods and services tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax) to E-commerce businesses and to our users is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the Internet and E-commerce. In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the Internet or E-commerce or communications conducted over the Internet. In addition, some jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing the Internet or some aspect of E-commerce or communications on the Internet.\nOne or more states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection, reporting or record-keeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate E-commerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance. One or more other jurisdictions may also seek to impose tax-collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an E-commerce transaction, regardless of where the respective users are located. Imposition of a discriminatory record-keeping or tax-collecting requirement could decrease seller activity on our sites and would harm our business.\nWe pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases within the various foreign countries in which we operate. In most cases, we are entitled to reclaim this input VAT from the various foreign countries. However, because of our unique business model, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain. A successful assertion by one or more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim VAT could harm our business.\nBroker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in our common stock because it is considered a penny stock and is subject to the penny stock rules.\nOur common stock currently constitutes \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Subject to certain exceptions, for the purposes relevant to us, \u201cpenny stock\u201d includes any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share. Rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on certain brokers-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d In particular, a broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or \u201caccredited investor\u201d (generally, an individual with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse), must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the penny stock regulations require the broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a broker-dealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer\u2019s account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks.\nThe additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our shares, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares and impede the sale of our shares in the secondary market.\nAs an issuer of \u201cpenny stock\u201d the protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward looking statements does not apply to us.\nAlthough the federal securities laws provide a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by a public company that files reports under the federal securities laws, this safe harbor is not available to issuers of penny stocks. As a result, if we are a penny stock, we will not have the benefit of this safe harbor protection if any claim that the material provided by us contained a material misstatement of fact or was misleading in any material respect because of our failure to include any statements necessary to ensure such statements were not misleading.\nWe have a limited market for our securities.\nAlthough certain market makers facilitate trades of our shares of common stock on the OTC Pink Limited Information market (\u201cOTCPink\u201d), operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc., there is currently a limited market for our shares and we cannot be certain that an active market will develop. The lack of an active public market could have a material adverse effect on the price and liquidity of our common stock. Broker-dealers often decline to trade in OTCPink stocks given that the market for such securities is often limited, the stocks are more volatile, and the risk to investors is greater. Consequently, selling our shares of common stock may be difficult because only small quantities of shares can be transacted at a time, thereby providing only limited liquidity, transactions can be delayed and securities analyst and news media coverage of our Company may be reduced. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of our common stock as well as lower trading volume. Investors should realize that they may be unable to sell shares of our common stock that they purchase. Accordingly, investors must be able to bear the financial risk of losing their entire investment in our common stock.\nOur registration under the Securities Exchange Act may be revoked and trading in our stock may be suspended\nOn April 26, 2014, the Company received a letter dated April 15, 2014 (the \u201cLetter\u201d) from the SEC stating that the Company appears not to be in compliance with the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. The Letter stated that the Company may be subject, without further notice, to an administrative proceeding pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act to revoke our registration under the Exchange Act if all required reports are not filed within fifteen days of the date of the Letter. Because the Letter was not received by the Company until April 26, 2014, the staff granted the Company until May 12, 2014 to file our delinquent reports. The Letter also stated that the Company\u2019s common stock may be subject to a trading suspension by the SEC pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act. The Company is in the process of preparing to draft all of its required reports in order to comply with its reporting requirements under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act; however, the Company did not meet the required filings by May 12, 2014. The Company submitted a letter to the SEC indicating that it intends to file all delinquent reports and to be current in our reporting obligations during April 2015. However, there can be no assurance that our registration under the Exchange Act will be maintained or that trading in our shares of common stock will not be suspended.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile, and this volatility may continue. For instance, during fiscal 2014, the low and high sale price of our common stock, as reported on the markets on which our securities have traded, ranged between $0.06 and $0.35. Numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our shares of common stock to fluctuate significantly. These factors include:\n\u25cf our earnings releases, actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, fluctuations in our operating results or our failure to meet the expectations of financial market analysts and investors;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u25cf speculation about our business in the press or the investment community;\n\u25cf significant developments relating to our relationships with our Business Associates, customers or suppliers;\n\u25cf stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that are in the E-commerce based industry;\n\u25cf customer demand for our products;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and trends;\n\u25cf major catastrophic events;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretation or principles;\n\u25cf loss of external funding sources;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock, including divestments by our directors, officers or significant stockholders; and\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel.\nMoreover, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our shares of common stock and other interests in our Company at a time when you want to sell your interest in us.\nThe rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.\nOur Board has the right, without stockholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights. This could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, and could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control. The Board exercised this right on August 16, 2012, when the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Michael Hansen, the Company\u2019s President and CEO. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company sold to Mr. Hansen 185,000 shares of \u201cSuper Voting Preferred Stock\u201d which entitled Mr. Hansen to 2,000 votes per share of Super Voting Preferred Stock or 370 million votes of the shares of common stock.\nThe possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to create any new series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future.", "PERMNO": 16640, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "OMNT"}
