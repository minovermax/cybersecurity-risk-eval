RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nThe loss or interruption of supply from our key parts suppliers could limit our ability to distribute our products.\nWe purchase certain products from various suppliers, some of which are located outside of the United States. Any loss or interruption of supply from our key parts suppliers may require us to find new suppliers. The number of suppliers for certain electronic components is limited. We could experience delays while we seek new suppliers and could have difficulty finding new suppliers, which would substantially impair our operating results and business.\nThe loss of the Illinois VGT contract with GTech would reduce our revenues and our profitability.\nWe currently have an exclusive contract to distribute VGT\u2019s in Illinois for Gtech. This exclusive contract is scheduled to expire on June 15, 2015. If the contract is not renewed, we will no longer be able to sell Spielo VGT\u2019s in Illinois which will significantly reduce our revenues and profitability. As part of this relationship, we hold approximately $3.5 million in VGT inventory, which if the contract is not renewed, will need to be sold or liquidated. There can be no assurance as to the amount which we could receive if liquidated.\nIntense competition in our industry could impair our ability to grow and achieve profitability.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors. The market for our products and services is intensely competitive and constantly attracts new competitors even as others leave the industry due to low barriers to entry to our business. We expect this competition to further intensify in the future. Some of our competitors are large companies with greater financial, marketing and product development resources. In addition, new competitors may enter our key markets. This may place us at a disadvantage in responding to our competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, technological advances and other initiatives.\nThe ability to assist our Illinois VGT customers to obtain financing may affect our VGT sales and profitability.\nOur Illinois VGT customers require significant financing in order to purchase our VGT equipment. Due to the high initial cost of VGT equipment, approximately 75% of our sales are dependent upon their ability to obtain financing. We have been successful to date in helping them to obtain financing from the equipment supplier and other independent sources, such as Firestone Financial. However, there is no certainty that we will be able to continue to receive adequate additional financing for our VGT customers in the future.\nThe gaming business is heavily regulated and we depend on our ability to obtain/maintain regulatory approvals.\nNearly all of the jurisdictions in the United States require licenses, permits, documentation of qualification, including evidence of financial stability, and other forms of approval for distributors of gaming equipment and supplies and for their key personnel. The revocation or denial of a license in a particular jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain licenses in other jurisdictions. In addition, laws and regulations applicable to our business could be changed or repealed. These changes could affect our business and results of operations.\nThe market price for our shares is susceptible to significant changes in market price.\nHistorically, the volume of trading of our shares has been relatively low. As a result, larger than average buy or sell orders on a given day, or news about us or the gaming industry, has had and may in the future have a significant impact on the trading price for our shares.\nThe current economic conditions might cause sales to decline without warning making it difficult to reduce costs fast enough to maintain profitability.\nOur customers\u2019 business (and their customers\u2019 business) might decline more than we or our customers are forecasting making it difficult for us to reduce our expenses as fast as our sales decline. Although the Company strives to keep our expenses in line with current sales, we could experience periods where the sales decline occurs so rapidly that we are unprofitable for a period of time.", "PERMNO": 63829, "SIC": 5090, "TIC": "AGNUQ"}
