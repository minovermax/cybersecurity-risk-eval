RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock involves risks. The following is a description of the material risks and uncertainties that the Company believes affect its business and an investment in the common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company is unaware of, or that it currently deems immaterial, also may become important factors that affect the Company and its business.

BUSINESS\nOperational Risk\nThe Company must effectively manage the need for technological change.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success will depend in part upon the Company\u2019s ability to address the needs of the Company\u2019s customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations as it continues to grow and expand the Company\u2019s market area. The Company may experience operational challenges as it implements these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in the Company not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require the Company to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.\nThe Company may experience system failure or cybersecurity breaches.\nThe Company is highly dependent on its computer systems and network infrastructure to conduct its operations, including the secure processing, storage and transmission of vital and sensitive data, exposing the Company to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. As a financial institution, the Company processes, stores and transmits a significant amount of personal customer information. The Company also maintains important internal data such as personally identifiable information about employees and information relating to the Company\u2019s operations. The Company relies on third-party service providers for significant portions of its computer systems, network infrastructure and information security, and failure or misconduct by any of those third parties or their systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over the Company\u2019s computer systems, are essential to protect the Company and its customers against fraud and cybersecurity breaches and for the Company to maintain customer confidence. The computer systems and network infrastructure the Company uses could fail or be subject to unforeseen problems. The Company\u2019s operations are dependent upon its ability to protect its computer systems and network against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from cybersecurity breaches, cyberattacks, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms, and other unauthorized or hostile acts which are becoming increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Any action, damage or failure that causes or results in breakdowns, disruptions, or unauthorized activities in the Company\u2019s computer systems or network infrastructure, including customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan or other systems, could disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to properly operate its business, damage the Company\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, investigations or fines, violate privacy or other applicable laws or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. External or internal actors could obtain unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s computer systems or network infrastructure or information stored in and transmitted through the Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in the theft or unauthorized use of personal information, which could cause significant liability to the Company and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with the Company. The pervasiveness of cybersecurity incidents in general and the risks of cybersecurity breaches are complex and continue to evolve as technology and reliance on these systems continue to evolve. In addition, advances in computer capabilities and the increased sophistication of fraudsters and hackers could result in a compromise or breach of the systems the Company and the Company\u2019s third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer data and transactions. A failure or compromise of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of March 1, 2021, the Company has not discovered any material cybersecurity incidents.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends significantly on its management team.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends significantly on the continued service and skills of the Company\u2019s existing executive management team. The implementation of the Company\u2019s business and growth strategies also depends significantly on the Company\u2019s ability to retain officers and employees with experience and business relationships within their respective market areas. The Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain key employees is dependent upon its compensation and benefits programs, continued growth and profitability, and reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees, as well as having appropriate levels of diversity and inclusion in its workforce. The cost of employee compensation constitutes a significant portion of the Company\u2019s non-interest expense and can materially impact results of operations. The Company could have difficulty replacing departed officers and employees with persons who are experienced in the specialized aspects of the Company\u2019s business or who have ties to the communities within the Company\u2019s market areas. The unexpected loss of any of the Company\u2019s key personnel could therefore have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and growth. The Company\u2019s continued success is dependent upon the ability of its executive management and the development of an appropriate succession plan for key officers.\nThe Company is reliant on third party service providers.\nThe Company depends on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, the Company receives core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems, cloud technologies, deposit processing and other processing services from third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or terminate their services, and the Company is unable to replace them with other service providers, particularly on a timely basis, the Company\u2019s operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if the Company is able to replace third party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to the Company, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to data processing failures, control failures and fraud.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer fraud or misconduct could subject the Company to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm the Company\u2019s reputation. Misconduct by the Company\u2019s employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from the Company, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of the Company\u2019s customers, or improper use of, or unauthorized access to confidential information. Customers are also subject to financial crimes, including fraud, wire fraud, and cyber-crimes, which could adversely impact their ability to pay loans or result in a fraudulent removal of funds from their deposit accounts or other unauthorized activities. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, or fraudulent and other criminal schemes impacting customers, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject the Company to financial claims for negligence.\nThe Company maintains a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors, cybersecurity breaches, and employee, customer, or third party fraud. However, if the Company\u2019s internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company relies heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans the Company will originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which the Company relies is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, or the Company may fund a loan that the Company would not have funded or on terms the Company would not have extended. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or another third party, the Company generally bears the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. A loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentations are often difficult to locate, and it is often difficult to recover any of the monetary losses that the Company may suffer.\nNew lines of business or new products and services subject the Company to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement or may acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting estimate and risk management programs rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes the Company uses to estimate its probable credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are accurate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.\nIf the models the Company uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models the Company uses for determining its probable credit losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models the Company uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments is inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Company could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the Company\u2019s analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to counterparty risk.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or customer. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe value of the Company\u2019s goodwill could become impaired.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeded the fair value of net assets that the Company acquired in connection with the purchase of another financial institution. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired. Significant and sustained decline in the Company\u2019s stock price and material adverse changes in economic conditions may result in taking future write downs related to the impairment of goodwill.\nThe Company determines impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in the Company\u2019s results of operations in the periods in which they become known. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.1 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. While the Company has not recorded any such impairment charges since the Company initially recorded the goodwill, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" for further discussions of goodwill valuation.\nStrategic Risk\nThe Company may not be able to continue to grow.\nTo achieve its past levels of growth, the Company has focused on both internal growth and acquisitions. The Company may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all. More specifically, the Company may not be able to grow earning assets, specifically loans, and the Company may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit loan growth and the completion of acquisitions. Further, the Company may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect its internal growth. If the Company is not able to continue its historical levels of growth, it may not be able to maintain its historical earnings trends. If the Company does not manage the Company\u2019s growth effectively, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be negatively affected, and the Company may not be able to continue to implement the Company\u2019s business strategy and successfully conduct the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company may not be able to continue its acquisition strategy.\nThe Company has been pursuing a growth strategy that includes the acquisition of other financial institutions in target markets. The Company has completed several acquisitions since 2010, most recently completing the acquisition of Guaranty Bancorp on January 1, 2019. The Company intends to continue its acquisition strategy. Such an acquisition strategy, involves significant risks, including the following:\n\u2022finding suitable markets for expansion;\n\u2022finding suitable candidates for acquisition;\n\u2022attracting funding to support additional growth;\n\u2022maintaining asset quality;\n\u2022attracting and retaining qualified management; and\n\u2022maintaining adequate regulatory capital.\nAccordingly, the Company may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates in the future that fit its acquisition and growth strategy. In addition, the Company\u2019s previous acquisitions may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate historical trends in the Company\u2019s financial results and operating performance, as the impact of such acquisitions make it more difficult to identify organic trends that would be reflected absent such acquisitions. If the Company is unable to continue to grow through acquisitions, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operation and future prospects could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company must effectively manage risk associated with its acquisition strategy.\nAcquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties, and acquired companies may have unknown or contingent liabilities with no available manner of recourse, exposure to unexpected asset quality problems, key employee and customer retention problems and other problems that could negatively affect the Company\u2019s organization. The Company may not be able to complete future acquisitions or, if completed, the Company may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, management, products and services of the entities that the Company acquires and eliminate redundancies. Acquisition activities and the integration process may also require significant time and attention from the Company\u2019s management that they would otherwise direct toward servicing existing business and developing new business. Further, the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, disruption of the combined entity\u2019s ongoing business, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers or employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction. Failure to successfully integrate the entities the Company acquires into the Company\u2019s existing operations may increase the Company\u2019s operating costs significantly and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and earnings. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of the Company\u2019s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction.\nThe Company has a geographic concentration in Texas and Colorado.\nThe Company conducts its operations almost exclusively in Texas and Colorado. This geographic concentration imposes risks from lack of geographic diversification. The economic conditions in Texas and Colorado affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects, where adverse economic developments, among other things, could affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of nonperforming assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of the Company\u2019s loans and loan servicing portfolio. Moreover, if the population or income growth in the Company\u2019s market areas is slower than projected, income levels, deposits and housing starts could be adversely affected and could result in a reduction of the Company\u2019s expansion, growth and profitability. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects Texas or Colorado, or existing or prospective borrowers or property values in such areas, may affect the Company and the Company\u2019s profitability more significantly and more adversely than the Company\u2019s competitors whose operations are less geographically concentrated.\nCredit Risk\nThe Company must manage credit risk.\nMaking any loan involves risk, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt, and risks resulting from changes in economic and market conditions. The Company\u2019s credit risk approval and monitoring procedures may fail to identify or reduce these credit risks, and they cannot completely eliminate all credit risks related to the Company\u2019s loan portfolio. The Company faces a variety of risk related to its types of loans. Adverse developments affecting commercial real estate values in the Company\u2019s market areas could increase the credit risk associated with commercial real estate loans, impair the value of the property pledged as collateral for these loans, and affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss. Further, due to the larger average size of commercial real estate loans, the Company faces risk that losses incurred on a small number of commercial real estate loans could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s commercial real estate loans also have the risk that repayment is subject to the ongoing business operations of the borrower. The Company\u2019s commercial loans also have the risk that repayment is subject to the ongoing business operations of the borrower. Commercial loans are often secured by personal property, such as inventory, and intangible property, such as accounts receivable, which if the business is unsuccessful, typically have values insufficient to satisfy the loan without a loss. If the overall economic climate in the United States, generally, or the Company\u2019s market areas in Texas and Colorado, specifically, experience material disruption, the Company\u2019s borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral the Company holds may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require additional provisions for loan losses, which would cause the Company\u2019s net income and return on equity to decrease.\nThe Company has a significant concentration in commercial real estate loans.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 51% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral, excluding agricultural loans secured by real estate. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in the Company\u2019s market areas could increase the credit risk associated with the Company\u2019s real estate loan portfolio. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of the Company\u2019s markets could increase the credit risk associated with the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, and could result in losses that would adversely affect credit quality, financial condition, and results of operation. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in the Company\u2019s market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses would have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that the Company would be required to increase the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company has exposure to credit risk related to the energy industry.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 1.8% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio was composed of loans made to companies engaged in oil production and oilfield services. The significant decline in oil prices during 2020 adversely effected some of these borrowers\u2019 ability to repay these loans and impaired the value of collateral securing some of these loans. Further, because energy is a material segment of the overall Texas economy, the decline and volatility in oil prices could have an impact on other segments of the Texas economy, including real estate. The Houston market economy in particular could be adversely affected. The Company\u2019s asset quality and results of operations could be adversely impacted by the direct and indirect effects of current and future conditions in the Texas energy industry.\nThe Company\u2019s Allowance for Loan Losses may be insufficient to absorb losses.\nThe Company establishes its allowance for loan losses and maintains it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses based on the Company\u2019s analysis of its portfolio and market environment. The allowance for loan losses represents the Company\u2019s estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available to the Company. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships, as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. Additions to the allowance for loan losses, which are charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses, are determined based on a variety of factors, including an analysis of the loan portfolio, historical loss experience and an evaluation of current economic conditions in the Company\u2019s market areas. The actual amount of loan losses is affected by changes in economic, operating and other conditions within the Company\u2019s markets, as well as changes in the financial condition, cash flows, and operations of the Company\u2019s borrowers, all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, and such losses may exceed current estimates.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.76% and as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 170.80%. Additional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than the Company has previously experienced. The Company may be required to take additional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan losses, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so or requirements by the Company\u2019s banking regulators. In addition, bank regulatory agencies will periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses and the value attributed to nonaccrual loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require the Company to recognize future charge-offs. If the assessment of loan losses is inaccurate, or if economic and market conditions experience material unanticipated changes, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, then the Company will need to make provisions to increase the allowance, which will adversely impact earnings. See also Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Provision for Loan Losses for additional discussion of financial impact of the allowance for loan losses. These adjustments may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe adoption of CECL may impact future loan loss provisions.\nAs discussed under Item 1,Business - \"Supervision and Regulation-Regulation of the Bank\", the Bank adopted CECL effective January 1, 2021. As a result of the implementation of CECL, the Company has implemented controls and procedures to measure and estimate the lifetime expected credit loss at the time a financial asset is initially added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter.\nThe Company has determined that the implementation of CECL will result in an increase in its combined allowance for loan losses and reserves for unfunded commitments (the \"ALLL\"). The Company\u2019s current estimate of the range of expected increase in the ALLL resulting from the implementation of CECL is further discussed at \"Part IV Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statements - Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements - ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d. The ultimate impact of the implementation of CECL could differ from the expectation.\nThe impact of CECL in future periods will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Should these factors materially change, the Company may be required to increase or decrease its allowance for credit losses, decreasing or increasing the Company\u2019s reported income, and introducing additional volatility into its reported earnings. In addition, CECL requires the application of greater management judgment that is supported by new models and more data elements than the previous allowance standard. The Company\u2019s adoption of the CECL model is expected to increase the complexity, and associated risk, of the analysis and processes relying on management judgment, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s mortgage business subjects the Company to additional risk.\nThe Company originates and sells residential mortgage loans through the Bank\u2019s mortgage division and purchases and sells residential mortgages through its mortgage warehouse business. As of December 31, 2020, mortgage warehouse purchase loans totaled $1.5 billion, or 11.1% of total loans held for investment, which represents a significant increase in this line of business. Mortgage lending and mortgage warehouse purchase lending include credit risk associated with commercial bank lending. This line of business is also subject to market volatility, changes in interest rates, volume volatility and changing appetite of investors for certain mortgage products.\nThrough its mortgage warehouse business, the Company provides guidance lines of credit to mortgage companies that originate and sell residential mortgages. As part of this process, the Bank funds and purchases the mortgage at closing, the mortgage company sells the mortgage to an institutional buyer, and the proceeds from that sale are the primary source of repurchase of the mortgage from the Bank. This process exposes the Bank to market and interest rate risk in the event that the mortgage is not sold. The Bank is also subject to risk of fraud by mortgage company employees and customers. While the Company has insurance against fraud in the mortgage process, fraud loss in excess of insurance limits or which is not covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Company has entered into loan purchase commitments and forward sales commitments to mitigate the interest rate risk related to mortgage origination activities. While the Company believes that its hedging strategies will be successful in mitigating exposure to interest rate risk associated with the origination and purchase of mortgage loans, no hedging strategy can completely mitigate risk. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed transactions, or inaccurate assumptions regarding future interest rates or market conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMortgage lending and mortgage warehouse purchase lending is subject to counterparty risk. The Company is from time to time required to hold or repurchase mortgage loans or reimburse investors as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties under the agreements pursuant to which it purchases and sells mortgage loans. While agreements with the originators and sellers of mortgage loans provide legal recourse that may allow the Company to recover some or all of losses, these companies are frequently not financially capable of paying large amounts of damages and as a result the Company can offer no assurance that it will not suffer loss as a result of these arrangements.\nThe Company may incur other costs and losses as a result of actual or alleged violations of regulations related to the origination and purchase of residential mortgage loans. The origination of residential mortgage loans is governed by a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, which are frequently changing. The Company sells residential mortgage loans that it has purchased or that it originated to various parties, including Ginnie Mae and GSEs such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and other financial institutions that purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. These types of costs and losses arising from the Company\u2019s mortgage business would negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company must manage interest rate risk.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, the Company\u2019s earnings are significantly dependent on the Company\u2019s net interest income, the principal component of the Company\u2019s earnings, which is the difference between interest earned by the Company from the Company\u2019s interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest paid by the Company on the Company\u2019s interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The Company expects that it will periodically experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities, meaning that either its interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than the Company\u2019s interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to the Company\u2019s position, this \u201cgap\u201d will negatively impact the Company\u2019s earnings. The impact on earnings is more adverse when the slope of the yield curve flattens, that is, when short-term interest rates increase more than long-term interest rates or when long-term interest rates decrease more than short-term interest rates. Many factors impact interest rates, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for the Company\u2019s borrowers, which increase the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as borrowers refinance their loans at lower rates.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities and other assets. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. Further, when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status, the Company reverses any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. At the same time, the Company continues to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income.\nIf short-term interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer term interest rates fall further, the Company could experience net interest margin compression as the Company\u2019s interest earning assets would continue to reprice downward while the Company\u2019s interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. Such an occurrence would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s net interest income and the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe replacement of LIBOR may subject the Company to additional risk.\nIn 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The administrator of LIBOR has proposed to extend publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings to June 23, 2023 and to cease publishing other LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable, and in any event, by December 31, 2021.It is not possible to predict whether banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, use LIBOR as a reference rate or what rate will be viewed as an acceptable reference rate. Although the Company has established a working group to address the LIBOR transition, the full extent of impact of these developments on the Company\u2019s business and financial results is not yet known. The transition from LIBOR may cause the Company to incur increased costs and additional risk. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes in or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans originated prior to 2021. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, any successor or replacement interest rates may perform differently, which may affect net interest income, change market risk profile and require changes to risk, pricing and hedging strategies. Any failure to adequately manage this transition could adversely affect impact the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company could experience losses on its investment securities in volatile rate environments.\nWhile the Company attempts to invest a significant percentage of its assets in loans (the Company\u2019s loan to deposit ratio was 90.8% as of December 31, 2020), the Company invests a percentage of its total assets (approximately 6.5% as of December 31, 2020) in investment securities as part of its overall liquidity strategy. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Company\u2019s securities portfolio was approximately $1.2 billion.\nFactors beyond the Company\u2019s control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in its portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when market interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities, and continued instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting market interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, the Company may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Risk\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risk.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. The Company relies on its ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of the Company\u2019s loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that the Company has adequate liquidity to fund the Company\u2019s operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of the Company\u2019s investment securities, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, the sale of loans, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity. The Company\u2019s most important source of funds consists of deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, the Company would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing the Company\u2019s funding costs and reducing the Company\u2019s net interest income and net income.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, investment maturities and sales of investment securities, and proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Company\u2019s equity and debt securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank. The Company also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize the Company\u2019s activities, or on terms that are acceptable to the Company, could be impaired by factors that affect the Company directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet the Company\u2019s expenses, pay dividends to the Company\u2019s shareholders, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying the Company\u2019s borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company must maintain adequate capital.\nThe Company faces significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide the Company with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet the Company\u2019s commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. In addition, the Company, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. The Company faces significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on the Company\u2019s financial condition and performance. In the future, the Company may not be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company fails to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Federal Reserve may require the Company to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve, which examines the Company and the Bank, requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under these requirements, in the future, the Company could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when the Company does not have the resources to provide it, and therefore the Company may be required to borrow the funds. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk\nThe Company is subject to legal and regulatory risk.\nThe Company, like all financial institutions, has been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. Litigation arises in a variety of contexts, including lending and deposit operations, intellectual property claims related to the technology used in business operations, employment practices, operating activities, fiduciary responsibilities, and other general business matters. The Company considers most of these proceedings to be in the normal course of business or typical for the industry. However, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters. Any material legal or regulatory proceeding could impose substantial cost and cause management to divert its attention from the Company\u2019s business and operations. Any adverse determination in a legal or regulatory proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for a description of a legal proceeding which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and, as a result, is subject to extensive regulation and supervision.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not the Company\u2019s shareholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on the Company, The Bank and their respective operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector. Additional legislation and regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could significantly affect the Company\u2019s powers, authority and operations, or the powers, authority and operations of the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices. These rules may result in increased regulatory compliance costs and subject the Company to increased potential liabilities related to its consumer banking business and residential mortgage lending activities.\nRegulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on the Company. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company must devote significant resources to compliance.\nVarious federal banking laws and regulations, including rules adopted by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, impose heightened requirements on certain large banks and bank holding companies. Most of these rules apply primarily to bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, but certain rules also apply to banks and bank holding companies with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets.\nThe Company and the Bank exceeded $10 billion in total consolidated assets (a) calculates FDIC deposits assessment base using a performance score and loss-severity score system; and (b) is subject to supervision and enforcement by the CFPB in connection with compliance with federal consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, the Company and the Bank is subject to the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act regarding limits on debit card interchange fees. The Durbin Amendment gives the Federal Reserve Board the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by a payment card issuer that, together with its affiliates, has assets of $10 billion or more and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted rules under this provision that limit the swipe fees that a debit card issuer can charge a merchant for a transaction to the sum of 21 cents and five basis points times the value of the transaction, plus up to one cent for fraud prevention costs. Accordingly, deposit insurance assessments and expenses related to regulatory compliance may increase, while any decrease in the amount of interchange fees that the Company receives would reduce the Company\u2019s revenue.\nThe imposition of these regulatory requirements and increased supervision has and will continue to require commitment of additional financial resources for regulatory compliance, which has increased the Company\u2019s cost of operations, and has and will continue to otherwise have an impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to continuous examination.\nTexas and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of the Company\u2019s business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a Texas or federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of the Company\u2019s operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in the Company\u2019s capital, to restrict the Company\u2019s growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against the Bank, the Company\u2019s officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Company\u2019s deposit insurance. If the Company becomes subject to such regulatory actions, the Company could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC deposit insurance assessments in the future.\nPrevious economic conditions and the Dodd-Frank Act caused the FDIC to increase deposit insurance assessments and may result in increased assessments in the future. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule that amended the Deposit Insurance Fund restoration plan and implemented certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Effective April 1, 2011, the assessment base is determined using average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity rather than the previous assessment base of adjusted domestic deposits. The final rule also provides the FDIC\u2019s board with the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted on February 7, 2011 without notice and comment, if certain conditions are met. An increase in the assessment rates could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company faces a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or Patriot Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the Company\u2019s policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that the Company has already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, the Company would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of the Company\u2019s business plan (including the Company\u2019s acquisition plans), which would negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for the Company.\nThere are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies.\nWith certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of the Company\u2019s voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the Company\u2019s directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of the Company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, prospective investors need to be aware of and comply with these requirements, if applicable, in connection with any such purchase of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. These provisions effectively inhibit certain mergers or other business combinations, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOther Risks Affecting Our Business\nVolatile market conditions and macro economic trends, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company is operating in a dynamic and challenging economic environment, including uncertain global, national and local market conditions. In particular, Texas and Colorado based financial institutions are affected by volatility in the energy markets and the potential impact of that volatility on real estate and other markets. The Company is also subject to uncertain interest rate conditions. These volatile economic conditions could adversely affect borrowers and their businesses as well as the value of collateral (particularly real estate collateral) securing loans, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation.\nFurthermore, as more fully discussed above under Item 1, Business - COVID Impact & Response and below under Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the pandemic has created increased market volatility and impacted the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operations in a number of ways. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact national, state, and local economies, the Company could experience credit and operating losses.\nThe Company operates in a competitive environment.\nThe Company conducts its operations almost exclusively in Texas and Colorado. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking services within the Company\u2019s market areas. These competitors include banks with nationwide operations, regional banks and other community banks. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices, or otherwise solicit deposits, in the Company\u2019s market areas. Furthermore, many of the Company\u2019s larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvement, resulting in additional or superior product offerings not offered by the Company. Also, the rise of \u201cFinTech\u201d entities presents an additional group of competitors which provide financial services through new electronic delivery systems. The Company\u2019s ability to successfully compete will depend on a number of factors, including its ability to maintain long-term customer relationships and customer satisfaction with the Company\u2019s products and services, the scope, relevance and pricing of the products and services the Company offers, industry and general economic trends, and the Company\u2019s ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking customers, the Company may be unable to continue to grow its loan and deposit portfolios, or may be required to increase the rates the Company pays on deposits or lower the rates it offers on loans, which could reduce the Company\u2019s profitability. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is reliant on deposits as a significant source of funding.\nThe Company relies on customer deposits as a significant source of funding. Competition among U.S. banks for customer deposits is intense, and may increase the cost of deposits or prevent new deposits, and may otherwise negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to grow its deposit base. The Company\u2019s deposit accounts may decrease in the future, and any such decrease could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s sources of funding, which impact could be material. Any changes the Company makes to the rates offered on its deposit products to remain competitive with other financial institutions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and liquidity. The demand for the deposit products the Company offers may also be reduced due to a variety of factors, such as digital banking technology, demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences, reductions in consumers\u2019 disposable income, regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products. In addition, a portion of the Company\u2019s deposits are brokered deposits and FDIC uninsured deposits. The levels of these types of deposits that the Company holds may be more volatile during changing economic conditions. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $1.5 billion, or 10.56%, of the Company\u2019s deposits consisted of brokered deposits.\nThe Company may be adversely impacted by natural disasters, health pandemics, and other local and worldwide events beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nNatural disasters, health pandemics, severe weather events, including those prominent in Texas and Colorado and those prominent in the geographic areas of vendors and business partners, together with worldwide hostilities, including terrorist attacks, and other external events could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. These events could also affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base, borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans, impair collateral, result in a loss of revenue or an increase in expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery and business continuity procedures and plans, the occurrence of any such event may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nHurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, earthquakes and other natural disasters and severe weather events have caused, and in the future may cause, widespread property damage and significantly and negatively affect the local economies in which the Company operates. The effect of catastrophic weather events if they were to occur, could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and business, as well as potentially increase the Company\u2019s exposure to credit losses and liquidity risks.\nThe Company could be subject to environmental risks.\nThe Company is subject to growing risk from climate change. Among the risks associated with climate change are more frequent severe weather events. As discussed in the previous factors, severe weather events subject the Company to significant risks and more frequent severe weather events magnify those risks. Actions to address climate change, such as efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and green energy initiatives, could have a significant impact on the Texas economy, in particular. While the Texas economy is more diversified than in the past and energy companies are working to adapt to climate change initiatives, the oil and gas industry has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on the overall Texas economy. Further, banking regulators are beginning to consider the risk presented by climate change on the financial system and may pass new regulations, such as climate related stress testing, to address this risk. The potential losses and costs associated with climate change related risks could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Company\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Company\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although the Company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, the Company\u2019s earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The Company cannot predict the effects of such policies upon the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK\nThe Company\u2019s stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. The Company\u2019s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\n\u2022new reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022perceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company and/or its competitors;\n\u2022new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022significant acquisitions or business combinations involving the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022the public float and trading volumes for the Company\u2019s common stock;\n\u2022changes in government regulations, including tax laws; and\n\u2022volatility in economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, disruption in energy markets and changes in the global economy.\nIn addition, although the Company\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock is less than that of other, larger financial institutions. Given the lower trading volume, significant sales of Company common stock, or the expectation of such sales, could cause the stock price to fall.\nThe Company is dependent upon the Bank for cash flow, and the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions is restricted.\nThe Company\u2019s primary tangible asset is the Bank. As such, the Company depends upon the Bank for cash distributions (through dividends on the Bank\u2019s stock) that the Company uses to pay the Company\u2019s operating expenses, satisfy the Company\u2019s obligations (including the Company\u2019s senior indebtedness, subordinated debentures, and junior subordinated indebtedness issued in connection with trust preferred securities), and to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock. There are numerous laws and banking regulations that limit the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company will not be able to satisfy the Company\u2019s obligations or pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock. Federal and state statutes and regulations restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions to the Company. These statutes and regulations require, among other things, that the Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. Further, state and federal banking authorities have the ability to restrict the payment of dividends by supervisory action.\nThe Company\u2019s dividend policy may change without notice, and the Company\u2019s future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nThe Company may change its dividend policy at any time without notice to the Company\u2019s shareholders. Holders of the Company\u2019s common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as the Company\u2019s board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any declaration and payment of dividends on common stock will depend upon the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, the Company\u2019s ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the common stock and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. Furthermore, consistent with the Company\u2019s strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs, and other factors, the Company has made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends, if any, paid to the Company\u2019s common shareholders.\nThe Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy in relation to the organization\u2019s overall asset quality, level of current and prospective earnings and level, composition and quality of capital. The guidance provides that the Company inform and consult with the Federal Reserve prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in an adverse change to the Company\u2019s capital structure, including interest on senior debt, subordinated debt and the subordinated debentures underlying the Company\u2019s trust preferred securities. If required payments on the Company\u2019s outstanding senior debt, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures, held by its unconsolidated subsidiary trusts, are not made or are suspended, the Company would be prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s largest shareholder and board of directors have historically, and currently, exert a controlling influence on the Company.\nCollectively, as of February 25, 2021, Messrs. Vincent Viola and David Brooks owned 11.9% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. Vincent Viola, the largest shareholder of the Company, currently owns 10.3% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock, and David Brooks, the Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, currently owns 1.6% of the Company\u2019s common stock, each calculated on a fully diluted basis. Further, as of the date hereof, the Company\u2019s other directors and executive officers currently own collectively approximately 1.9% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. These individuals have historically, and currently, exert controlling influence in the Company\u2019s management and policies.\nIn addition, Michael Viola, a director of the Company, is the son of Vincent Viola. Further, David Brooks, the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has a 33 year history of ownership and operation of the Bank with Vincent Viola; and he has a joint investment with Mr. Viola outside of the Company. Given these close relationships, even though he does not serve on the Company\u2019s board, Mr. Viola has and will continue to have an influence over the direction and operation of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s corporate organizational documents and the provisions of Texas law make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition of the Company that you may favor.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of formation and bylaws contain various provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control of the Company. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022staggered terms for directors;\n\u2022a provision that directors cannot be removed except for cause;\n\u2022a provision that any special meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders may be called only by a majority of the Company\u2019s board of directors, the Chairman or a holder or group of holders of at least 20% of the Company\u2019s shares entitled to vote at such special meeting; and\n\u2022a provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered only at an annual or special meeting of shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of formation provides for noncumulative voting for directors and authorizes the board of directors to issue shares of its preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The issuance of the Company\u2019s preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a controlling interest in the Company. In addition, certain provisions of Texas law, including a requirement that two-thirds of the shares outstanding must approve major corporate actions, such as an amendment to the Company\u2019s certificate of formation or the approval of a merger, and a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Texas corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control of the Company. Also, the Company\u2019s certificate of formation prohibits shareholder action by written consent.\nOther debt and equity instruments have priority over the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn the event of any winding up and termination of the Company, the Company common stock would rank below all claims of the holders of the Company\u2019s debt and any preferred stock then outstanding. The Company has a senior, revolving credit facility under which the Company may borrow up to $100 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $6.5 million drawn upon this credit facility, which was subsequently paid down and has no borrowings as of March 1, 2021. Further, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding\n\u2022$310 million of aggregate principal amount of subordinated indebtedness; and\n\u2022$57.3 million of subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities\nUpon the winding up and termination of the Company, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets until after all of the Company\u2019s obligations to the Company\u2019s debt holders have been satisfied and holders of the Company\u2019s senior debt, subordinated debt, and junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities have received any payments and other distributions due to them. In addition, the Company is required to pay interest on the Company\u2019s senior debt, subordinated debt and subordinated debentures and junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with the Company\u2019s trust preferred securities before the Company pays any dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s board of directors may also, in its sole discretion, designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock from the Company\u2019s authorized and unissued preferred stock, which may have preferences with respect to common stock in dissolution, dividends, liquidation or otherwise.\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is not an insured deposit.\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss or guaranteed by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. An investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this report and shareholders who acquire the Company\u2019s common stock could lose some or all of their investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe pandemic has heightened credit risk.\nThe pandemic has heightened the credit risks described above, particularly with respect to loans made to businesses in the hospitality and retail sectors, which have been hardest hit by the economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, 3.8% and 15.4% of the Company\u2019s total loans held for investment (excluding mortgage warehouse purchase loans) were loans made to companies engaged in the hospitality business and companies that own and operate retail real estate, respectively. The financial performance of the Company is dependent upon the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral supporting loans. The pandemic has caused and is likely to cause significant disruption in the business of our customers. Continued unfavorable market conditions and uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is likely to continue to cause a deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, additional provisions for loan losses, adverse asset values of the collateral securing loans and an overall material adverse effect on the quality of the loan portfolio of the Company. Various state governments and federal agencies are requiring lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers. Regulatory programs and governmental policies, including the PPP loan program as discussed under Item 1, Business - COVID-19 Impact and Response, may impact the Company\u2019s ability to resolve credit delinquencies and risk of holding unforgiven PPP loans at unfavorable interest rates.\nThe pandemic has increased interest rate risk.\nFollowing the outbreak of the pandemic, market interest rates declined significantly to historic lows. The reductions in interest rates, and continued fluctuations in the interest rate environment as a result of changes in monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board, including in connection with efforts to address the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, could have significant adverse effects on the yields received by the Company on its earning assets and otherwise compress the Company\u2019s net interest margin which is an important component of the Company\u2019s earnings. Continued volatility in interest rates could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s earnings, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe pandemic has heightened operational risk, particularly with respect to cybersecurity.\nThe pandemic has also heightened the operational risks described above. As discussed under Item 1, Business - COVID-19 Impact and Response, COVID-19 has caused the Company to change its business operations in a number of ways to protect the health and safety of its customers and employees, and to comply with governmental directives. These changes may have detrimental impacts on the Company\u2019s business due to reduced effectiveness of operations and unavailability of personnel. In addition, there is heightened sensitivity and exposure to cybersecurity risks resulting from the Company\u2019s increased use of and dependence on remote working technology. The Company may take further action that it determines is in the best interest of employees, customers and the communities the Company serves, or as may be required by government regulations and ordinances. To date, the measures taken by the Company have not materially impaired the Company\u2019s ability to support employees, conduct business and serve its customers, but there is no assurance that these measures will mitigate all risk associated with COVID-19, or that the Company's ability to operate will not be materially impacted in the future. Similarly, if any of the Company\u2019s vendors or business partners upon which it relies are unable to deliver their products and services as a result of limitations on operations imposed by COVID-19, the Company\u2019s ability to serve customers could be impaired.\nThe change in business operations and continued market uncertainty could also have a detrimental effect on the Company\u2019s relationship with its customers as well as reduce demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company upon which it relies to drive growth.\nThe pandemic has increased legal and regulatory risk.\nThe PPP loan program, as discussed under Item 1 COVID-19 Impact and Response, including but not limited to PPP Round 2, was launched within a significantly compressed timeframe, with updates and guidance rapidly changing and emerging. In addition, the health and safety measures required by federal, state and local governments is unprecedented. Litigation related to banks\u2019 implementation of the PPP loan program, as well as companies health and safety practices instituted to address the pandemic has already begun to emerge. Litigation arising out of pandemic related issues could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe full extent of impact from the pandemic in uncertain.\nThe full extent to which the pandemic impacts the Company's business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and the actions required to contain and treat it, including but not limited to the effectiveness and availability of vaccinations, reactions by companies, clients, investors, governmental entities and financial, commodities (including oil and gas) and other markets to such actions, and the effect of the pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions, among other factors. There can be no assurance that efforts by the Company to address the adverse impacts of COVID-19 will be effective. If the significant effects of the pandemic are prolonged and if the Company is unable to recover from this business disruption on a timely basis, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be significantly adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 13877, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "IBTX"}
