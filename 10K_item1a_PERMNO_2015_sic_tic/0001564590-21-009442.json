The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance. The extent of this impact on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. It will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, related restrictions on travel, temporary store closure requirements and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, and the extent of any recession resulting from the pandemic. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, or its overall impact on our business and financial performance.\nClosures and Operational Restrictions of Our Retail Stores and Our Wholesale Customers\u2019 Stores\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees, consumers and communities, beginning in March 2020, we (including our joint ventures), and our distributors, licensees and franchisees, temporarily closed a significant number of our company- and joint venture-owned retail stores, and our distributor-, licensee- and franchisee-owned retail stores, respectively, around the world. While over 90% of our company- and joint venture-owned retail stores and over 90% of our third party-owned retail stores around the world have reopened (although many with temporarily reduced operating hours) as of the filing date of this report, collectively, we may face recurring store closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving or new increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. In addition, many of our significant wholesale customers have closed many of their stores, which will adversely impact our revenues from these customers. As a result, our business and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, materially adversely impacted by store closures and operational restrictions.\nEven as we and our wholesales customers reopen our stores, as the number of people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, consumer fear about becoming ill with the disease and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or self-quarantine may continue to increase, which has, and will continue to, adversely affect traffic to stores. Any significant reduction in consumer visits to, or spending at, our wholesale customers\u2019 stores and our retail stores, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and any decreased spending at stores caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending during and following this pandemic, has resulted in, and will continue to result in, a loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects on our business and results of operations.\nDisruptions or Delays in Our Supply Chain\nAlthough not a material issue as of the filing date of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic has also caused delays in shipments of our products and could once again have the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. More specifically, the majority of our manufacturers are located primarily in China and Vietnam. To date, the Chinese and Vietnamese governments have imposed certain restrictions on business operations and the movement of people and goods, including the temporary closure of some factories and businesses in China and restrictions on others in Vietnam, to limit the spread of COVID-19. As a result, we have seen and may yet again see disruptions or delays in shipments, and we may experience negative impacts to pricing of our products due to changes in availability of inventory, which could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOffice Closures, Focus of Key Personnel and Productivity of Employees\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental guidance or requirements, beginning in March 2020, we also temporarily closed many of our corporate offices and other facilities, including our corporate headquarters in Manhattan Beach, California, and implemented a policy for many of our corporate employees to work remotely. While we began to allow a limited number of personnel back to our corporate offices with added safety measures and staggered work schedules in June, these evolving work place arrangements may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business.\nIn addition, our management team is focused on mitigating the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across the entire company, thereby diverting their attention from other priorities that existed prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. If these conditions worsen, or last for an extended period of time, our ability to manage our business may be impaired, and operational risks and other risks facing us even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic may be elevated.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Has Had A Negative Impact On The Global Economy, And Our Sales Are Influenced By Economic Conditions That Impact Consumer Spending And Consumer Confidence.\nFootwear is a cyclical industry that is dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending and consumer confidence. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected, there is economic uncertainty or volatility or during recessionary periods. Our wholesale customers anticipate and respond to adverse changes in economic conditions and uncertainty by closing doors, reducing inventories, canceling orders or increasing promotional activity. Our retail stores are also affected by these conditions, which may lead to a decline in consumer traffic and spending in these stores as they reopen. As a result, factors that diminish consumer spending and confidence in any of the markets in which we compete, particularly deterioration in general economic conditions, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, inflation, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on tourism and tourist spending, volatility in investment returns, fear of unemployment, increases in energy costs or tax or interest rates, housing market downturns, fear about and impact of pandemic illness (such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced store traffic and widespread temporary store closures), and other factors such as acts of war, natural disasters or terrorist or political events that impact consumer confidence, have reduced, and may continue to reduce (with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic), our sales and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition through their negative impact on our wholesale customers as well as decreased spending in our retail stores and potentially via our e-commerce business.\nRisks Related to Customers, Competition and Retail Operations\nOur Future Success Depends On Our Ability To Maintain Our Brand Name And Image With Consumers.\nOur success to date has in large part been due to the strength of the Skechers brand. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brand name and image depends on sustained effort and commitment to, and significant investment in, both the successful development of high-quality, innovative, fashion forward products, and fresh and relevant marketing and advertising campaigns. Even if we are able to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and trends with new high-quality products, our marketing and advertising campaigns may not resonate with consumers, or consumers may consider our brand to be outdated or associated with footwear styles that are no longer popular or relevant. Our brand name and image with consumers could also be negatively impacted if we or any of our products were to receive negative publicity, whether related to our products or otherwise. If we are unable to maintain, promote and grow our brand image, then our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Future Success Also Depends On Our Ability To Respond To Changing Consumer Preferences, Identify And Interpret Consumer Trends, And Successfully Market New Products.\nThe footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences. The continued popularity of our footwear and the development of new lines and styles of footwear with widespread consumer appeal, including consumer acceptance of our performance footwear, requires us to accurately identify and interpret changing consumer trends and preferences, and to effectively respond in a timely manner. Continuing demand and market acceptance for both existing and new products are uncertain and depend on the following factors:\n\u2022\nsubstantial investment in product innovation, design and development;\n\u2022\ncommitment to product quality; and\n\u2022\nsignificant and sustained marketing efforts and expenditures, including with respect to the monitoring of consumer trends in footwear specifically, and in fashion and lifestyle categories generally.\nIn assessing our response to anticipated changing consumer preferences and trends, we frequently must make decisions about product designs and marketing expenditures several months in advance of the time when actual consumer acceptance can be determined. As a result, we may not be successful in responding to shifting consumer preferences and trends with new products that achieve market acceptance. Because of the ever-changing nature of consumer preferences and market trends, a number of companies in the footwear industry, including ours, experience periods of both rapid growth, followed by declines, in revenue and earnings. If we fail to identify and interpret changing consumer preferences and trends, or are not successful in responding to these changes with the timely development of products that achieve market acceptance, we could experience excess inventories, higher than normal markdowns, returns, order cancellations or an inability to profitably sell our products, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe Face Intense Competition, Including Competition From Companies In The Performance Footwear Market and Those With Significantly Greater Resources Than Ours, And If We Are Unable To Compete Effectively With These Companies, Our Market Share May Decline And Our Business Could Be Harmed.\nWe face intense competition from other established companies in the footwear industry. Our competitors\u2019 product offerings, pricing, costs of production, and advertising and marketing expenditures are highly competitive areas in our business. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. A number of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the footwear industry, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production, keep up with rapid changes in footwear technology, and more quickly develop new products. New companies may also enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the footwear industry. In addition, negative consumer perceptions of our performance features due to our historical reputation as a fashion and lifestyle footwear company may place us at a competitive disadvantage in the performance footwear market. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, cost increases, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our development and marketing of new products, which would materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Depend Upon A Relatively Small Group Of Customers For A Large Portion Of Our Sales.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our net sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 8.8% of total net sales, respectively. No one customer accounted for more than 10.0% of outstanding accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2020. Although we have long-term relationships with many of our customers, our customers do not have a contractual obligation to purchase our products and we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our existing major customers. Store closures or re-closures, decreased foot traffic and economic recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has, and will likely continue to, adversely affect our performance and could continue to adversely affect the financial condition of many of our customers. If any major existing customer ceases or decreases its purchases from us, cancels its orders, delays or defaults on its payment obligations to us, reduces the floor space, assortments, fixtures or advertising for our products or changes its manner of doing business with us for any reason, such as due to store closures, decreased foot traffic or recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, such actions may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Furthermore, the retail industry regularly experiences consolidation, contractions and closings, which may result in our loss of customers or our inability to collect accounts receivable of major customers, and we have recently experienced delays in payments from some of our customers and others have gone bankrupt. If we lose a major customer, experience a significant decrease in sales to a major customer or are unable to collect the accounts receivable of a major customer due to any of the foregoing reasons, our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur Strategies Involve A Number Of Risks That Could Prevent Or Delay The Successful Opening Of New Stores As Well As Negatively Impact The Performance Of Our Existing Stores.\nOur ability to successfully open and operate new stores depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to identify suitable store locations, the availability of which is outside of our control; negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances; source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores; hire, train and retain store personnel; successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations; and satisfy the fashion preferences in new geographic areas.\nIn addition, some or a substantial number of new stores could be opened in regions of the U.S. in which we currently have few or no stores. Any expansion into new markets may present competitive, merchandising and distribution challenges that are different from those currently encountered in our existing markets. Any of these challenges could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that any new store openings are in existing markets, we may experience reduced sales volumes in existing stores in those markets. If sales decline at our retail stores, whether through competition from online sites or other companies, we may decide to close stores, which could result in additional costs, expenses, asset impairments or asset write-downs.\nOur Global Retail Business Has Required, And Will Continue To Require, A Substantial Investment And Commitment Of Resources And Is Subject To Numerous Risks And Uncertainties.\nOur global retail business has required substantial investments in leasehold improvements, inventory and personnel. We have also made substantial operating lease commitments for retail space worldwide. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our global retail business, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs or impairments of leasehold improvements, and employee-related termination costs. The success of our global retail operations also depends on our ability to identify and adapt to changes in consumer spending patterns and retail shopping preferences globally, including the shift from brick and mortar to direct-to-consumer and mobile channels, and our ability to effectively develop our direct-to-consumer and mobile channels. Our failure to successfully respond to these factors could adversely affect our retail business, as well as damage our brand and reputation, and could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nMany Of Our Retail Stores Depend Heavily On The Customer Traffic Generated By Shopping And Factory Outlet Malls Or By Tourism.\nMany of our concept stores are located in shopping malls, and some of our factory outlet stores are located in manufacturers\u2019 outlet malls where we depend on obtaining prominent locations and the overall success of the malls to generate customer traffic. We cannot control the success of individual malls, and an increase in store closures by other retailers may lead to mall vacancies and reduced foot traffic. Some of our concept stores occupy street locations that are heavily dependent on customer traffic generated by tourism. Any substantial decrease in tourism resulting from an economic slowdown, political, social or military events or otherwise, has and is likely to continue to adversely affect sales in our existing stores, particularly those with street locations. The effects of these factors could continue to reduce sales of particular existing stores or hinder our ability to open retail stores in new markets, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nRisks Related to Inventory, Manufacturing and Distribution\nOur Business Could Be Harmed If We Fail To Maintain Proper Inventory Levels.\nWe place orders with our manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers\u2019 orders. We do this to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. Any unanticipated decline in the popularity of Skechers footwear or other unforeseen circumstances may make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast product demand trends, and we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impair our brand image and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, and diminish brand loyalty.\nOur International Sales And Manufacturing Operations Are Subject To The Risks Of Doing Business Abroad, Particularly In China and Vietnam, Which Could Affect Our Ability To Sell Or Manufacture Our Products In International Markets, Obtain Products From Foreign Suppliers Or Control The Costs Of Our Products.\nSubstantially all of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2020, were derived from sales of footwear manufactured in foreign countries, with most manufactured in China and Vietnam. We also sell our footwear in several foreign countries and plan to increase our international sales efforts as part of our growth strategy. Foreign manufacturing and sales are subject to a number of risks, including the following: political and social unrest, including terrorism; changing economic conditions, including higher labor costs; increased costs of raw materials; currency exchange rate fluctuations; labor shortages and work stoppages, including those due to the outbreak of a disease leading to an epidemic or pandemic spread; electrical shortages; transportation delays; loss or damage to products in transit; expropriation; nationalization; the adjustment, elimination or imposition of domestic and international duties, tariffs, quotas, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers; exposure to different legal standards (particularly with respect to intellectual property); compliance with foreign laws; changes in domestic and foreign governmental policies; and there may be circumstances in the future where we may have to incur premium freight charges to expedite the delivery of product to our customers. If we incur a significant amount of premium charges to airfreight product for our customers, our gross profit will be negatively affected if we are unable to collect those charges. Apart from the aforementioned impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risks, but we cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring or the resulting long-term adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn particular, because most of our products are manufactured in China and Vietnam, the possibility of adverse changes in trade or political relations with China or Vietnam, political instability in China or Vietnam, increases in labor costs, the occurrence of prolonged adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster such as an earthquake or typhoon in China or Vietnam, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease in China or Vietnam could severely interfere with the manufacturing and/or shipment of our products and would have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the Communist Party of China (\u201cPRC\u201d). The government of the PRC has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate under the PRC may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. Under its current leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the government of the PRC will continue to pursue these policies, or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice. A change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors: changes in laws, regulations or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises.\nWe Rely On Independent Contract Manufacturers And, As A Result, Are Exposed To Potential Disruptions In Product Supply.\nOur footwear products are currently manufactured by independent contract manufacturers. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the top five manufacturers of our products produced approximately 42.1% of our total purchases. One manufacturer accounted for 21.0% of total purchases for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe compete with other footwear companies for production facilities, and we do not have long-term contracts with any of our contract manufacturers. Under our current arrangements with them, these manufacturers generally may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time. If our current manufacturers cease doing business with us, we could experience an interruption in the manufacture of our products. Although we believe that we could find alternative manufacturers, we may be unable to establish relationships with alternative manufacturers that will be as favorable as the relationships we have now. For example, new manufacturers may have higher prices, less favorable payment terms, lower manufacturing capacity, lower quality standards or higher lead times for delivery. If we are unable to provide products consistent with our standards or the manufacture of our footwear is delayed or becomes more expensive, our business and financial condition would be harmed.\nWhile not a material issue as of the filing date of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic previously led to the Chinese and Vietnamese governments imposing temporary closures of some of our factories in China and restrictions on others in Vietnam that caused delays in shipment of our products. We may encounter similar challenges yet again with these manufacturers, or new difficulties could arise with our manufacturers or any raw material suppliers on which our manufacturers rely, including prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, reductions in the availability of production capacity due to government imposed restrictions, failure to meet our quality control standards, failure to meet production deadlines or increased manufacturing costs. This could result in our customers canceling orders, refusing to accept deliveries or demanding reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a negative impact on our cash flow and harm our business and results of operations.\nOur Ability To Deliver Our Products To The Market Could Be Disrupted If We Encounter Problems Affecting Our Logistics And Distribution Systems.\nWe rely on owned or independently operated distribution facilities to transport, warehouse and ship products to our customers. Our logistics and distribution systems include computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Substantially all of our products are distributed from a few key locations. Therefore, our operations could be interrupted by travel restrictions, earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution centers. Our business interruption insurance may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions affecting our distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of brand image. In addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of product to and from our distribution facilities. If we encounter problems affecting our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Economic and External Factors\nThe Uncertainty Of Global Market Conditions May Continue To Have A Negative Impact On Our Business, Results Of Operations Or Financial Condition.\nWhile global economic conditions have recently improved slightly, their uncertain state, including the challenging consumer retail market in the U.S., may negatively impact our business, which depends on the general economic environment and levels of consumers\u2019 discretionary spending that affect not only the ultimate consumer, but also retailers, who are our primary direct customers. If the current economic situation does not improve or if it weakens, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales to existing customers, make sales to new customers, open and operate new retail stores, maintain sales levels at our existing stores, maintain or increase our international operations on a profitable basis, or maintain or improve our earnings from operations as a percentage of sales. Additionally, if there is an unexpected decline in sales, our results of operations will depend on our ability to implement a corresponding and timely reduction in our costs and manage other aspects of our operations. These challenges include (i) managing our infrastructure, (ii) hiring and maintaining, as required, the appropriate number of qualified employees, (iii) managing inventory levels and (iv) controlling other expenses. If the uncertain global market conditions continue for a significant period of time or worsen, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur Business Could Be Adversely Affected By Changes In The Business Or Financial Condition Of Significant Customers Due To Global Economic Conditions.\nThe global financial crisis affected the banking system and financial markets and resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, more stringent lending standards and terms, and higher volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. In addition, our business could be adversely affected by other economic conditions, such as the insolvency of certain of our key distributors, which could impair our distribution channels, or the diminished liquidity or an inability to obtain credit to finance purchases of our product by our significant customers. Our customers may also experience weak demand for our products or other difficulties in their businesses. If economic, financial or political conditions in global markets deteriorate in the future, demand may be lower than forecasted and insufficient to achieve our anticipated financial results. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNatural Disasters Or A Decline In Economic Conditions In California Could Increase Our Operating Expenses Or Adversely Affect Our Sales Revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2020, a substantial portion of our operations are located in California, including 110 of our retail stores, our headquarters in Manhattan Beach, and our U.S. distribution center in Rancho Belago. Because a significant portion of our sales is derived from sales in California, a decline in the economic conditions in California, whether or not such decline spreads beyond California, could materially adversely affect our business. Furthermore, a natural disaster or other catastrophic event, such as an earthquake or wildfire affecting California, could significantly disrupt our business including the operation of our only domestic distribution center. We may be more susceptible to these issues than our competitors whose operations are not as concentrated in California.\nRisks Related to Currency and Debt\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business And Results Of Operations.\nForeign currency fluctuations affect our revenue and profitability. Changes in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results positively or negatively in one period and not another, which may make it difficult to compare our operating results from different periods. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties that manufacture our products by making their costs of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, thereby raising prices for us, our distributors and/or our licensees. We do not currently engage in hedging activities with respect to these currency exchange rate risks. For a more detailed discussion of the risks related to foreign currency fluctuation, see Item 7A: \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nIn addition, our foreign subsidiaries purchase products in U.S. dollars in which the cost of those products will vary depending on the foreign currency exchange rates and will impact the price charged to customers. Our foreign distributors also purchase products in U.S. dollars and sell in local currencies, which impacts the price to foreign consumers. As the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies, our revenues and profits are reduced when translated into U.S. dollars and our margins may be negatively impacted by the increase in product costs due to foreign currency exchange rates. Although we typically work to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations through price increases and further actions to reduce costs, we may not be able to fully offset the impact, if at all. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage or mitigate these foreign currency impacts, as changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe Have Debt And Interest Payment Requirements At Levels That May Restrict Our Future Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $735.0 million of debt and $250.0 million of additional borrowings available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. In March 2020, as a precautionary measure to maximize liquidity and to increase available cash on hand, we drew down on our unsecured revolving credit facility. Our debt requires us to dedicate cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt. This dedicated use of cash could impact our ability to successfully compete by, for example:\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the general retail environment; and\n\u2022 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nChanges In Tax Laws Or The Potential Imposition Of Additional Duties, Quotas, Tariffs And Other Trade Restrictions Could Have An Adverse Impact On Our Sales And Profitability.\nAll of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the U.S., the European Union and other countries are subject to customs duties collected by customs authorities. Customs information submitted by us is routinely subject to review by customs authorities. We are unable to predict whether there may be unfavorable changes in tax laws in the U.S. or overseas, additional customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism or other trade restrictions imposed on the importation of our products in the future. Such actions could adversely affect our ability to produce and market footwear at competitive prices and might have an adverse impact on the sales and profitability of Skechers.\nChanges to Trade Policy, including New Tariffs Imposed By The U.S. Government, Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Results Of Operations.\nChanges in social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the countries from which we import our products, or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. The U.S. government has placed or proposed additional tariffs on certain goods imported from China and may enact new tariffs on additional goods imported from China, including footwear and other products that we import. China had imposed tariffs on a wide range of American products in retaliation and responded to the new proposed tariff by, among other things, adjusting the value of its currency. China and the U.S. have made progress and are in discussions to finalize a trade agreement, however there is no guarantee that any agreement between the countries will be reached. China could impose additional tariffs or take other actions if the countries are unable to come to an agreement. The majority of our products that we sell in the U.S. are manufactured in China. The U.S. government has also negotiated a replacement trade deal for NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the \u201cUSMCA\u201d), which still needs to be ratified. There is also a concern that the imposition of additional tariffs by the U.S. could result in the adoption of additional tariffs by other countries as well. If the U.S. government does not reach a trade agreement with China or replaces NAFTA with USMCA, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the U.S. or other countries in connection with a global trade war, the resulting escalation of trade tensions could have a significant, adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. While it is too early to predict whether or how the recent policy changes will impact our business, the imposition of tariffs on footwear, apparel or other items imported by us from China could require us to increase prices to our customers or, if unable to do so, result in lowering our gross margin on products sold. Tariffs on footwear imported from China could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Business Could Be Harmed If Our Contract Manufacturers, Suppliers Or Licensees Violate Labor, Trade Or Other Laws.\nWe require our independent contract manufacturers, suppliers and licensees to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Manufacturers are required to certify that neither convicted, forced or indentured labor (as defined under U.S. law) nor child labor (as defined by law in the manufacturer\u2019s country) is used in the production process, that compensation is paid in accordance with local law and that their factories are in compliance with local safety regulations. Although we promote ethical business practices and our sourcing personnel periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent contract manufacturers, suppliers and licensees, we do not control them or their labor practices. If one of our independent contract manufacturers, suppliers or licensees violates labor or other laws or diverges from those labor practices generally accepted as ethical in the U.S., it could result in adverse publicity for us, damage our reputation in the U.S., or render our conduct of business in a particular foreign country undesirable or impractical, any of which could harm our business.\nIn addition, if we, or our foreign manufacturers, violate U.S. or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to extra duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and the forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import, or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record-keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, quota category, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas, or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, and have a negative impact on our operating results.\nThe Disruption, Expense And Potential Liability Associated With Existing And Unanticipated Future Litigation Against Us Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business, Results Of Operations, Financial Condition And Cash Flows.\nIn addition to the legal matters included in our reserve for loss contingencies, we occasionally become involved in litigation arising from the normal course of business, and we are unable to determine the extent of any liability that may arise from any such unanticipated future litigation. We have no reason to believe that there is a reasonable possibility or a probability that we may incur a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to any other such loss contingencies. However, the\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and assessments and decisions on defense and settlement can change significantly in a short period of time. Therefore, although we consider the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote with respect to those matters for which we have not reserved an amount for loss contingencies, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of our expectations, our consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, any unanticipated litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could also significantly divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees being incurred. Such disruptions, legal fees and any losses resulting from these unanticipated future claims could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Management and Employees\nWe Depend On Key Personnel To Manage Our Business Effectively In A Rapidly Changing Market, And If We Are Unable To Retain Existing Personnel, Our Business Could Be Harmed.\nOur future success depends upon the continued services of Robert Greenberg, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Greenberg, President and a member of our Board of Directors; and David Weinberg, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and a member of our Board of Directors. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or any other key employee could harm us. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for employees in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nWe Have A Significant Work Force And Are Subject To Risks Related To Human Capital Management.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we employee over 11,500 employees worldwide. A significant portion of our operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits, and we spend significant time and effort managing these employees. We cannot ensure that we will be able to maintain a happy and productive workforce. Some of our employees may take actions that harm our business or we may face other issues with our employees, such as retention. Although we spend a significant amount of time and expense on human capital management, we cannot ensure that these efforts will be successful.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Information Technology\nOur Ability To Compete Could Be Jeopardized If We Are Unable To Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights Or If We Are Sued For Intellectual Property Infringement.\nWe believe that our trademarks, design patents and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our Skechers\u00ae, Skechers Performance\u2122, Skechers GOrun\u00ae, Skechers GOwalk\u00ae, Skechers GOgolf\u00ae, Skechers GOtrain\u00ae, Skechers on-the-GO\u00ae, \u00ae, \u00ae, \u00ae, , Skechers Cali\u00ae, Skecher Street\u00ae, Skechers USA\u00ae, Skechers Active\u2122, Skechers Sport Active\u2122, Skechers Work\u2122, Skechers Max Cushioning\u2122, Mark Nason\u00ae, D\u2019Lites\u00ae, DLT-A\u00ae, BOBS\u00ae, Energy Lights\u00ae, Glide Step\u2122, Skech-Air\u00ae, Twinkle Toes\u00ae, Z-Strap\u00ae, Mega-Flex\u00ae, Luminators\u00ae, Heart Lights\u2122, Relaxed Fit\u00ae, Arch Fit\u2122, Ultra GO\u00ae, Hyper Burst\u00ae, Skechers Memory Foam\u2122, and Air-cooled Memory Foam\u00ae trademarks to be among our most valuable assets, and we have registered these trademarks in many countries. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We also have a number of design patents and a limited number of utility patents covering components and features used in various shoes. We believe that our patents and trademarks are generally sufficient to permit us to carry on our business as presently conducted. While we vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure patents or trademark protection for our intellectual property in the future or that protection will be adequate for future products. Further, we have been sued in the past for patent and trademark infringement and cannot be sure that our activities do not and will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are compelled to prosecute infringing parties, defend our intellectual property or defend ourselves from intellectual property claims made by others, we may face significant expenses and liability as well as the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business, each of which could negatively impact our business or financial condition.\nIn addition, the laws of foreign countries where we source and distribute our products may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. We cannot be assured that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights outside the U.S. will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or, if necessary, successfully challenge another party\u2019s counterfeit products or products that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights on the basis of trademark or patent infringement. Continued sales of counterfeit products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the U.S., and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nBreaches Or Compromises Of Our Information Security Systems, Information Technology Systems And Our Infrastructure To Support Our Business Could Result In Exposure Of Private Information, Disruption Of Our Business And Damage To Our Reputation, Which Could Harm Our Business, Results Of Operation And Financial Condition.\nAs a routine part of our business, we utilize information security and information technology systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or private information regarding our customers, employees, vendors and others. A security breach of our network, hosted service providers, or vendor systems, may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks, and the retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. Although we take measures to safeguard this sensitive information, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants.\nWe invest in industry standard security technology to protect personal information. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect against transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Although we maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for cyber risks related to what we believe to be adequate and collectible insurance in the event of theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data, any compromise or breach of our cyber security systems could result in private information exposure and a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant potential liability including legal and financial costs, and loss of confidence in our security measures by customers, which could result in damage to our brand and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data. Compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nRisks Related to Our Stock and Stock Price\nOur Quarterly Revenues And Operating Results Fluctuate As A Result Of A Variety Of Factors, Including Seasonal Fluctuations In Demand For Footwear, Delivery Date Delays And Potential Fluctuations In Our Estimated Annualized Tax Rate, Which May Result In Volatility Of Our Stock Price.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and can be expected to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our major customers have no obligation to purchase forecasted amounts, may and have canceled orders in the past, and may change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice and without penalty. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. In addition, sales of footwear products have historically been somewhat seasonal in nature, with the strongest domestic sales generally occurring in our second and third quarters for the back-to-school selling season. Domestic back-to-school sales typically ship in June, July and August, and delays in the timing, cancellation, or rescheduling of these customer orders and shipments by our wholesale customers could negatively impact our sales and results of operations for our second or third quarters. More specifically, the timing of when product ships is determined by the delivery schedules set by our wholesale customers, which could cause sales to shift between our second and third quarters. Because our expense levels are partially based on our expectations of future sales, our expenses may be disproportionately large relative to our revenues, and we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shifts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur annualized tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary at the end of each quarter, and it is highly sensitive to fluctuations in projected international earnings. Any quarterly fluctuations in our annualized tax rate that may occur could have a material impact on our quarterly operating results. As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will likely vary from quarter to quarter, and the results for any particular quarter may not be necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in revenues or net earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors could cause a decrease in the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nOne Principal Stockholder Is Able To Substantially Control All Matters Requiring Approval By Our Stockholders And Another Stockholder Is Able To Exert Significant Influence Over All Matters Requiring A Vote Of Our Stockholders, And Their Interests May Differ From The Interests Of Our Other Stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Robert Greenberg, beneficially owned 86.5% of our outstanding Class B Common Stock, members of Mr. Greenberg\u2019s immediate family beneficially owned an additional\n7.9% of our outstanding Class B Common Stock, and Gil Schwartzberg, trustee of several trusts formed by Mr. Greenberg and his wife for estate planning purposes, beneficially owned 29.8% of our outstanding Class B Common Stock. The holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have identical rights except that holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share while holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As a result, as of December 31, 2020, Mr. Greenberg beneficially owned 37.6% of the aggregate number of votes eligible to be cast by our stockholders, and together with shares beneficially owned by other members of his immediate family, Mr. Greenberg and his immediate family beneficially owned 43.4% of the aggregate number of votes eligible to be cast by our stockholders, and Mr. Schwartzberg beneficially owned 18.0% of the aggregate number of votes eligible to be cast by our stockholders. Therefore, Messrs. Greenberg and Schwartzberg are each able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders. Matters that require the approval of our stockholders include the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. Mr. Greenberg also has significant influence over our management and operations. As a result of such influence, certain transactions are not likely without the approval of Messrs. Greenberg and Schwartzberg, including proxy contests, tender offers, open market purchase programs or other transactions that can give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for their shares of our Class A Common Stock. Because Messrs. Greenberg\u2019s and Schwartzberg\u2019s interests may differ from the interests of the other stockholders, their ability to substantially control or significantly influence, respectively, actions requiring stockholder approval, may result in the Company taking action that is not in the interests of all stockholders. The differential in the voting rights may also adversely affect the value of our Class A Common Stock to the extent that investors or any potential future purchaser view the superior voting rights of our Class B Common Stock to have value.\nOur Charter Documents And Delaware Law May Inhibit A Takeover, Which May Adversely Affect The Value Of Our Stock.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. Mr. Greenberg\u2019s substantial beneficial ownership position, together with the authorization of Preferred Stock, the disparate voting rights between our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, the classification of our Board of Directors and the lack of cumulative voting in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, may discourage bids for our Class A Common Stock at a premium over the market price of the Class A Common Stock and may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 86949, "SIC": 3140, "TIC": "SKX"}
