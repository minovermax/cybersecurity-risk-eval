RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may affect our business. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Form 10-K and the Company\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and an investment in our common stock may involve various risks. Such risks, including, but not limited to, the following summarized risks, should be carefully considered before making an investment in our common stock:\nSummary of risks related to REIT status\n\u2022Because qualification as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), there can be no assurance that we will remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\u2022U.S. federal, state and local legislative, judicial or regulatory tax changes could have an adverse effect on our shareholders and us.\n\u2022Complying with the REIT requirements may cause us to sell assets or forgo otherwise attractive investment opportunities.\n\u2022We may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and grow.\n\u2022Our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.\n\u2022Certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and other taxes, which would reduce our cash flows, and would cause potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.\n\u2022The tax imposed on REITs engaging in \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d may limit our ability to engage in transactions that would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes.\nSummary of risks related to our business\n\u2022Changes in economic conditions, particularly in Hawai\u2018i, may adversely affect our Commercial Real Estate, Land Operations, and Materials & Construction segments.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread has had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u2022Although we intend to market and sell non-strategic assets, many of the assets are relatively illiquid, and it may not be possible to dispose of such assets in a timely manner or on favorable terms, which could delay our strategic agenda and/or adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, cash flows and may result in additional non-cash impairment charges.\n\u2022We may face potential difficulties in obtaining operating and development capital.\n\u2022We may raise additional capital in the future on terms that are more stringent to us, which could provide holders of new issuances rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those currently held by our common stockholders, or that could result in dilution of common stock ownership.\n\u2022Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in our credit facilities could impose restrictions on our business segments, capital availability or the ability to pursue other activities.\n\u2022An increase in fuel prices may adversely affect our operating environment and costs.\n\u2022Noncompliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Work stoppages or other labor disruptions by our unionized employees or those of other companies in related industries, may increase operating costs or adversely affect our ability to conduct business.\n\u2022Interruption, breaches or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to operate, adversely affect our financial condition, and damage our reputation.\n\u2022Weather, natural disasters and the impacts of climate change may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Political crises, public health crises and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations and profitability.\n\u2022We are subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, that could have an adverse effect on us.\nSummary of risks related to our Commercial Real Estate segment\n\u2022We are subject to a number of factors that could cause leasing rental income to decline.\n\u2022The bankruptcy or loss of key tenants in our commercial real estate portfolio may adversely affect our cash flows and profitability.\n\u2022A shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to online shopping may have an adverse impact on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space, or re-lease space as leases expire, thereby increasing or prolonging vacancies, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Our retail centers may depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants.\n\u2022Certain of our leases at our retail centers contain \u201cco-tenancy\u201d or \u201cgo-dark\u201d provisions, which, if triggered, may allow tenants to pay reduced rent, cease operations, or terminate their leases, which could adversely affect our performance or the value of the applicable retail property.\n\u2022We may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of properties that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth.\n\u2022We face competition for the acquisition and development of real estate properties, which may impede our ability to grow our operations or may increase the cost of these activities.\n\u2022We are subject to risks associated with real estate construction and development.\nRisks Related to REIT Status\nBecause qualification as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, there can be no assurance that we will remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe have determined that we operated in compliance with the REIT requirements commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2017. However, qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, for which there may be only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and depends on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various requirements concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature of our assets, the diversity of our share ownership and the amounts we distribute to our shareholders. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control can potentially affect our ability to continue to qualify as a REIT. In addition, no assurance can be given that future legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements for qualification as a REIT or adversely affect the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. In addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT depends, in part, on the actions of third parties, over which we have no control or only limited influence. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification.\nAlthough we intend to operate in a manner consistent with the REIT requirements, we cannot be certain that we will remain so qualified. Under current law, if we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our net taxable income. In addition, our taxable income would be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax at the regular corporate rates. Also, unless we are entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we would also be disqualified from re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during which we failed to qualify as a REIT. Cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be significantly reduced for each year in which we do not qualify as a REIT. In that event, we would not be required to continue to make distributions.\nAlthough we currently intend to continue to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause us, without the consent of our shareholders, to revoke the REIT election or to otherwise take action that would result in disqualification.\nU.S. federal, state and local legislative, judicial or regulatory tax changes could have an adverse effect on our shareholders and us.\nThe present U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs and their shareholders may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. The U.S. federal income tax rules dealing with REITs are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and the U.S. Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. Revisions in U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT and the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us, or could cause us to change our investments and commitments.\nAlso, the Hawai\u2018i State legislature has repeatedly considered, and could consider in the future, legislation that would (i) eliminate (i.e., repeal) the REIT dividends paid deduction for Hawai\u2018i State income tax purposes related to income generated in Hawai\u2018i for a number of years or permanently, and/or (ii) mandate withholding of Hawai\u2018i State income tax on dividends paid to out-of-state shareholders. These provisions could result in double taxation of REIT income in Hawai\u2018i under the Hawai\u2018i tax code, reduce returns to shareholders and make our stock less attractive to investors, which could in turn lower the value of our stock.\nYou are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our stock.\nOur significant use of taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRSs\u201d) may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.\nThe net income of our TRSs is not required to be transferred to us, and such TRS income that is not transferred to us is generally not subject to our REIT distribution requirements. However, if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities, taken together with other non-qualifying assets, to represent more than 25% of the fair market value of our total assets, or causes the fair market value of our TRS securities alone to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our total assets, in each case as determined for REIT asset testing purposes, we would, absent timely responsive action, fail to qualify as a REIT.\nComplying with the REIT requirements may cause us to sell assets or forgo otherwise attractive investment opportunities.\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must continually satisfy various requirements concerning, among other things, the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our shareholders. For example, we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our total assets consists of some combination of \u201creal estate assets\u201d (as defined in the Code), cash, cash items and U.S. government securities. The remainder of our investments (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our total assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRS. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to sell assets or forgo otherwise attractive investment opportunities. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income, amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and amounts available for making payments on our indebtedness.\nWe may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and grow.\nWe generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to maintain our qualification as a REIT. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify as a REIT but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, including any net capital gains, we will be subject to tax at ordinary corporate tax rates on the retained portion. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our shareholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. We intend to make distributions to our shareholders to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code and avoid corporate income tax and the 4% annual excise tax.\nFrom time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity or adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long- term debt. Furthermore, the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures and further growth and expansion initiatives. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWhether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock owned by our existing shareholders may be reduced. In addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current shareholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. Depending on the share price we are able to obtain, we may have to sell a significant number of shares to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our shareholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to income from \u201cqualified dividends\u201d payable to U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is currently 20%, exclusive of the 3.8% investment tax surcharge. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates applicable to qualified dividends. Although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our common stock. However, for taxable years that begin before January 1, 2026, shareholders that are individuals, trusts or estates are generally entitled to a deduction equal to 20% of the aggregate amount of ordinary income dividends received from a REIT, subject to certain limitations.\nThe REIT ownership limitations and transfer restrictions contained in our articles of incorporation may restrict or prevent certain transfers of our common stock, could have unintended antitakeover effects and may not be successful in preserving our qualification for taxation as a REIT.\nFor us to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, among other requirements, not more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year beginning with our 2018 taxable year. Also, such shares must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year beginning with our 2018 taxable year. In addition, a person actually or constructively owning 10% or more of the vote or value of the shares of our capital stock could lead to a level of affiliation between the Company and one or more of its tenants that could cause our revenues from such affiliated tenants to not qualify as rents from real property. Our articles of incorporation include certain restrictions regarding transfers of our shares of capital stock and ownership limits that are intended to assist us in satisfying these limitations, among other purposes.\nSubject to certain exceptions, our articles of incorporation prohibit any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock.\nAdditionally, the constructive ownership rules for these limits are complex and groups of related individuals or entities may be deemed a single owner and consequently in violation of the share ownership limits. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock, or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions, may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. As a result, if a violative transfer were made, the recipient of the shares would not acquire any economic or voting rights attributable to the transferred shares.\nThe transfer restrictions and ownership limits may prevent certain transfers of our common stock. These restrictions and limits may not be adequate in all cases, however, to prevent our qualification for taxation as a REIT from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce the ownership limits. If the restrictions in our articles of incorporation are not effective and, as a result, we fail to satisfy the REIT tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.\nThe ownership limits contained in our articles of incorporation may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control of us that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders. As a result, the overall effect of the ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our shareholders. This potential inability to obtain a premium could reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.\nA REIT generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains). Generally, we expect to distribute all, or substantially all, of our REIT taxable income, including net capital gains, so as to not be subject to the income or excise tax on undistributed REIT taxable income. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine on a quarterly basis the amount of cash to be distributed to our shareholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions, that may impose limitations on cash payments and plans for future acquisitions and divestitures. Consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate.\nCertain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and other taxes, which would reduce our cash flows, and would cause potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.\nOur TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate rates. We also may be subject to a variety of other taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local, and foreign income, property, transfer and other taxes on assets and operations. In addition, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. We also could incur a 100% excise tax on transactions with a TRS, if they are not conducted on an arm\u2019s length basis, or we also could be subject to tax in situations and on transactions not presently contemplated. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash.\nIn addition, the IRS and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time we qualified as a REIT, in which case we will owe these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties, if any. Moreover, any increase in taxable income for these pre-REIT periods will likely result in an increase in pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits, which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our shareholders after the relevant determination.\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d may limit our ability to engage in transactions that would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes.\nA REIT\u2019s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. The term \u201cprohibited transaction\u201d generally includes a sale or other disposition of property (including mortgage loans, but other than foreclosure property, as discussed below) that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business. We might be subject to this tax if we were to dispose of or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a prohibited transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe intend to conduct our operations so that no asset that we own (or are treated as owning) will be treated as, or as having been, held for sale to customers, and that a sale of any such asset will not be treated as having been in the ordinary\ncourse of our business. As a result, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans at the REIT level, and may limit the structures we utilize for our securitization transactions, even though the sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial to us. In addition, whether property is held \u201cprimarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business\u201d depends on the particular facts and circumstances. No assurance can be given that any property that we sell will not be treated as property held for sale to customers, or that we can comply with certain safe-harbor provisions of the Code that would prevent such treatment. The 100% prohibited transaction tax does not apply to gains from the sale of property that is held through a TRS or other taxable corporation, although such income will be subject to tax in the hands of the corporation at regular corporate rates. We intend to structure our activities to prevent prohibited transaction characterization.\nThe ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification, without shareholder approval, may cause adverse consequences to our shareholders.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that the board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our shareholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to be a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income, and we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our shareholders.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nChanges in economic conditions, particularly in Hawai\u2018i, may adversely affect our Commercial Real Estate, Land Operations, and Materials & Construction segments.\nOur business, including our assets and operations, is concentrated in Hawai\u2018i, which exposes us to more concentrated risks than if our assets and operations were more geographically diverse. A weakening of economic drivers in Hawai\u2018i, which include tourism, military and consumer spending, public and private construction starts and spending, personal income growth, and employment, or the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, or economic conditions on the Mainland and elsewhere, may adversely affect the level of real estate leasing activity in Hawai\u2018i, the demand for or sale of Hawai\u2018i real estate, and demand for our materials and construction products. In addition, an increase in interest rates or other factors could reduce the market value of our real estate holdings, as well as increase the cost of buyer financing that may reduce the demand for our real estate assets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread has had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") was first reported in Wuhan, China, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Considerable uncertainty surrounds COVID-19 and its effects on the population, as well as the effectiveness of any responses taken by government authorities and the availability and efficacy of vaccinations and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19. The pandemic has caused a decline in Hawai\u2018i tourism, visitor arrivals and commercial activity and has had an adverse impact on Hawai\u2018i\u2019s economy. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread has had a material adverse effect (refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this report), and could continue to have a material adverse effect, on our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWith respect to our Commercial Real Estate segment, the pandemic and related governmental restrictions have adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our tenants' operations and financial condition, as governmental instructions and restrictions regarding safe practices and travel to the State have reduced customer foot traffic and has also caused certain of our tenants to close their brick-and-mortar stores and spaces. Our rental revenue and operating results depend significantly on the occupancy levels at our properties, the level of business activity of our tenants and the consequent ability of our tenants to meet their rent and other obligations to us. Tenants that experience deteriorating financial conditions due to the pandemic may be unwilling or unable to pay rent in full, on a timely basis, or pay any amount of rent. Certain of our tenants may incur significant costs or losses responding to the pandemic, lose business due to any interruption in the operations of our properties, or incur other losses or liabilities related to shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, infection or other related factors. Federal, state, local and industry-initiated efforts also may limit our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent. In addition, the deterioration of economic conditions as a result of the pandemic may decrease occupancy levels and rents across our portfolio as tenants reduce or defer their spending, which could adversely affect the value of our properties. With respect to our Land Operations segment, declines in Hawai\u2018i tourism, the impact of varying travel and other restrictions in the islands and other ramifications of COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact the timing and ability to close sales transactions involving developed and undeveloped land. And with respect to our Materials & Construction Segment, any\nresulting slowdown or delays in, or work stoppages or workforce disruptions relating to, infrastructure and other projects could reduce the revenues and profits from our materials and construction businesses.\nThe extent and duration of the economic disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain. Further deterioration of economic conditions may adversely impact or destabilize the lending, capital and other financial markets. Consequently, our access to capital and other sources of funding may become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals, or the refinancing of our debt.\nWe may face new or increased competition.\nThere are numerous other developers, buyers, managers and owners of commercial and residential real estate and undeveloped land that compete or may compete with us for management and leasing revenues, land for development, properties for acquisition and disposition, and for tenants and purchasers of properties. Intense competition could lead to increased supply of space, which could then increase vacancies, the need for increased tenant incentives, decreased rents, sales prices or sales volume, or lack of development opportunities. Additionally, our tenants may face increased competition and/or shifts in market preferences and demand that adversely impact their performance, ability to pay rent or even their business viability.\nFurther, increasing competitive market conditions, including out-of-state or new in-state contractors competing for a limited number of projects available, could adversely impact Grace Pacific's results of operations through market share erosion due to lost bids, as well as lower pricing and thus lower margins realized on successful bids. Grace Pacific also mines aggregate and imports asphalt for sale. Grace Pacific\u2019s customers could seek alternative sources of supply, similar to some of its competitors that are importing liquid asphalt and aggregate.\nAlthough we intend to market and sell non-strategic assets, many of the assets are relatively illiquid, and it may not be possible to dispose of such assets in a timely manner or on favorable terms, which could delay our strategic agenda and/or adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, cash flows and may result in additional non-cash impairment charges.\nOur ability to dispose of non-strategic assets on advantageous terms, including pricing, depends on factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, competition from other sellers, insufficient infrastructure capacity or availability (e.g., water, sewer and roads) for real estate assets, the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers and market conditions. As a result, we may be unable to realize our strategy to simplify through dispositions, we may be unable to do so on advantageous terms, or we may not be able to execute the strategy in a timely manner, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows and may result in additional non-cash impairment charges.\nIn addition, many of the non-strategic assets are relatively illiquid. Illiquid assets typically experience greater price volatility, as a ready market does not exist, and can be more difficult to value. In addition, validating third party pricing for illiquid assets may be more subjective than more liquid assets. As a result, we may record additional non-cash impairment charges and/or realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded such assets.\nWe may face potential difficulties in obtaining operating and development capital.\nThe successful execution of our strategy requires substantial amounts of operating and development capital. Sources of such capital could include banks, life insurance companies, public and private offerings of debt or equity, including rights offerings, sale of certain assets and joint venture partners. If our investment or credit profile deteriorates significantly, our access to the debt or equity capital markets may become restricted, our cost of capital may increase, or we may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Further, we rely on our ability to obtain and draw on a revolving credit facility to support our operations. Volatility in the credit and financial markets or deterioration in our credit profile may prevent us from accessing funds. There is no assurance that any capital will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, to satisfy our short or long-term cash needs.\nWe may raise additional capital in the future on terms that are more stringent to us, which could provide holders of new issuances rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those currently held by our common stockholders, or that could result in dilution of common stock ownership.\nAs noted above, the successful execution of our strategy requires substantial amounts of operating and development capital. If our capital needs are not able to be filled through our existing liquidity sources (e.g., our revolving credit facility), we may require additional capital. If we incur additional debt or raise equity, the terms of the debt or equity issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of any new debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than\ncurrently in place. If we issue additional common equity, either through public or private offerings or rights offerings, your percentage ownership in us would decline if you do not participate on a ratable basis.\nFailure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in our credit facilities could impose restrictions on our business segments, capital availability or the ability to pursue other activities.\nOur credit facilities and term debt contain certain restrictive financial covenants. If we breach any of the covenants and such breach is not cured in a timely manner or waived by the lenders, and such event results in default, our access to credit may be limited or terminated and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts immediately due and payable. We further may be limited in our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in event of default.\nIncreasing interest rates would increase our overall interest expense.\nInterest expense on our floating-rate debt would increase if interest rates rise. Additionally, the interest expense associated with fixed-rate debt could rise in future periods when the debt matures and is refinanced. Furthermore, the value of our commercial real estate portfolio and the market price of our stock could decline if market interest rates increase and investors seek alternative investments with higher distribution rates.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method in which LIBOR is determined.\nWe have a number of financial instruments (refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report) which bear interest at a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus an applicable margin (certain of these financial instruments are subject to interest rate swaps through maturity at fixed rates) and we may incur additional debt indexed to LIBOR in the future. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We are not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be available or if another alternative reference rate attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement.\nWe may need to amend certain agreements related to financial instruments and agree upon a benchmark replacement index with the bank and, as a result, the interest rate on our financial instruments may change. The new rate may not be as favorable as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out. Furthermore, the transition process may result in delays in funding, higher interest expense, additional expenses and increased volatility in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR. Although the full impact of such reforms and actions together with any transition away from LIBOR remains unclear, these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing, including LIBOR-based loans, and on our financing costs.\nAn increase in fuel prices may adversely affect our operating environment and costs.\nFuel prices have a direct impact on the health of the Hawai\u2018i economy. Increases in the price of fuel may result in higher transportation costs to Hawai\u2018i and adversely affect visitor counts and the cost of goods shipped to Hawai\u2018i, thereby affecting the strength of the Hawai\u2018i economy and its consumers. Increases in fuel costs also can lead to other non-recoverable, direct expense increases to us through, for example, increased costs of energy and petroleum-based raw materials used in the production of aggregate, and the manufacture, transportation, and placement of hot mix asphalt. Increases in energy costs for our leased real estate portfolio are typically recovered from lessees, although our share of energy costs increases as a result of lower occupancies, and higher operating cost reimbursements impact the ability to increase underlying rents. Rising fuel prices also may increase the cost of construction, including delivery costs to Hawai\u2018i, and the cost of materials that are petroleum-based, thus affecting our real estate development projects and margins.\nNoncompliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations may adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including government rate, land use, environmental, climate-related and tax regulations. Noncompliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing our business could impose significant additional costs on us and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the real estate segments are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, which, if changed or not complied with, may adversely affect our business. We frequently utilize \u00a71031 of the Code to defer taxes when selling qualifying real estate and reinvesting the proceeds in replacement properties. This often occurs when we sell bulk parcels of land in Hawai\u2018i or commercial properties in Hawai\u2018i, all of which typically have a very low tax basis. A repeal of, or adverse amendment to, \u00a71031 of the Code could impose significant additional costs on us. We are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations; Environmental Protection Agency regulations; and state and county permits related to our\noperations. The Materials & Construction segment is additionally subject to Mine Safety and Health Administration regulations.\nWork stoppages or other labor disruptions by our unionized employees or those of other companies in related industries, may increase operating costs or adversely affect our ability to conduct business.\nMany of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. We may be adversely affected by actions taken by our employees or those of other companies in related industries against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices. Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of our failure, or that of other companies in our industry, to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully. For example, in our Materials & Construction segment, a labor disruption resulting from a unionized workforce stoppage may significantly impede our production and ability to complete projects that are in process. Additionally, in our Land Operations segment, we may be unable to complete a development-for-sale project if building materials or labor are unavailable due to labor disruptions in the relevant trade groups.\nInterruption, breaches or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to operate, adversely affect our financial condition, and damage our reputation.\nWe rely extensively on information technology and communication systems to process transactions and to operate and manage our business. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and cybersecurity-threatening intrusions. Further, we may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, terrorism, war, the intentional or inadvertent acts and errors by our employees or vendors, or other problems at our facilities. Despite our implementation of security measures, there can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security of our systems will be effective. Any failure or breaches of our systems could result in improper uses of our systems and interruptions in our operations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and reputation. We may incur significant costs to remedy damages caused by disruptions to our systems.\nSimilarly, our vendors and tenants rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage their businesses and, thus, are also at risk from, and may be impacted by, cybersecurity attacks. An interruption in the business operations of our vendors and tenants resulting from a cybersecurity attack could indirectly impact our business operations.\nFurther, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have transitioned a significant subset of our employees to a remote work environment, which may exacerbate certain risks to our businesses, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of cybersecurity attacks and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of proprietary or confidential information.\nWeather, natural disasters and the impacts of climate change may adversely affect our business.\nAs a result of climate change, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, including natural disasters. Should the impact of climate change be significant or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur Commercial Real Estate and Land Operations segments are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, sea level rise, fires, tornadoes and unusually heavy or prolonged rain, which could cause personal injury and loss of life. In addition, natural disasters could damage our real estate holdings, which could result in substantial repair or replacement costs to the extent not covered by insurance, a reduction in property values, or a loss of revenue, and could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop, lease and sell properties. The occurrence of natural disasters could also cause increases in property insurance rates and deductibles, which could reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, owning or developing our properties.\nDrought, greater than normal rainfall, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, sea level rise, fires, other natural disasters, agricultural pestilence, or negligence or intentional malfeasance by individuals, may also adversely impact the conditions of the land and thereby harming the prospects for the Land Operations segment, including our renewable energy operations, and our land infrastructure and facilities, including dams and reservoirs.\nThe Materials & Construction segment is notably impacted by weather conditions. For example, periods of wet or other adverse weather conditions could interrupt paving activities, resulting in delayed or loss of revenue, under-utilization of crews and equipment and less efficient rates of overhead recovery. Adverse weather conditions also restrict the demand for aggregate products, increase aggregate production costs and impede its ability to efficiently transport material.\nWe maintain casualty insurance under policies we believe to be adequate and appropriate. These policies are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles. Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from physical damage to dams, generally are not insured. In some cases, we retain the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk. Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available. Finally, we retain all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of our insurance.\nPolitical crises, public health crises and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations and profitability.\nPolitical crises (including but not limited to heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism or other acts of violence) and public health crises (including, but not limited to, pandemics) may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawai\u2018i, thereby adversely affecting Hawai\u2018i\u2019s economy and us. Further, as our business is concentrated in Hawai\u2018i, an attack on Hawai\u2018i as a result of war or terrorism may severely or irreparably harm the Company.\nSuch events beyond our control could adversely affect trade and global and local economies and may lead to actions limiting trade and population movement and the movement of goods through the supply chain, as well as other impacts to business and consumer demand, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, that could have an adverse effect on us.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, relating to labor and employment matters, contractual disputes, personal injury and property damage, environmental matters, construction litigation, business practices, and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section. These disputes could harm our business by distracting our management from the operation of our business. If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings could result in significant expenditures or losses by us. Further, as a real estate developer, we may face warranty and construction defect claims, as described below under \u201cRisks Relating to Our Land Operations Segment.\u201d\nImpairment in the carrying value of long-lived assets could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheet and have recorded non-cash impairment charges in the past. Under generally accepted accounting principles, long-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. If business conditions or other factors cause profitability and cash flows to decline, we may be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges. Events and conditions that could result in further impairment in the value of our long-lived assets include changes in the industries in which we operate, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global or Hawai\u2018i economy, as well as competition and advances in technology, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Commercial Real Estate Segment\nWe are subject to a number of factors that could cause leasing rental income to decline.\nWe own a portfolio of commercial real estate assets. Factors that may adversely affect the portfolio\u2019s profitability include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant number of our tenants are unable to meet their obligations; (ii) increases in non-recoverable operating and ownership costs; (iii) we are unable to lease space at our properties when the space becomes available; (iv) the rental rates upon a renewal or a new lease are significantly lower than prior rents or do not increase sufficiently to cover increases in operating and ownership costs; (v) the providing of lease concessions, such as free or discounted rents and tenant improvement allowances; and (vi) the discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other environmental, culturally-sensitive, or related issues at the property.\nThe bankruptcy or loss of key tenants in our commercial real estate portfolio may adversely affect our cash flows and profitability.\nWe may derive significant cash flows and earnings from certain key tenants. If one or more of these tenants declares bankruptcy or voluntarily vacates from the leased premise and we are unable to re-lease such space (or to re-lease it on comparable or more favorable terms), we may be adversely impacted. Additionally, we may be further adversely impacted by\nan impairment or \u201cwrite-down\u201d of intangible assets, such as lease-in-place value, favorable lease asset, or a deferred asset related to straight-line lease rent, associated with a tenant bankruptcy or vacancy.\nA shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to online shopping may have an adverse impact on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough many of the retailers operating at our properties sell groceries and other necessity-based soft goods or provide services, the shift to online shopping may cause declines in brick-and-mortar sales generated by certain of our tenants and/or may cause certain of our tenants to reduce the size or number of their retail locations in the future. As a result, our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space, or re-lease space as leases expire, thereby increasing or prolonging vacancies, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to renew leases, lease vacant space, or re-let space as leases expire. In addition, we may need to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights, or below-market renewal options to retain existing tenants or attract new tenants. If the rental rates for our properties decrease, our existing tenants do not renew their leases, or we do not re-let our available space, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nIncreases in operating expenses would adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operating expenses include, but are not limited to, property taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs, and the maintenance of the common areas of our commercial real estate. We may experience increases in our operating expenses, some or all of which may be out of our control. Most of our leases require that tenants pay for a share of property taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance costs. However, if any property is not fully occupied, or if recovery income from tenants is not sufficient to cover operating expenses, then we could be required to expend our own funds for operating expenses. In addition, we may be unable to renew leases or negotiate new leases with terms requiring our tenants to pay all the property tax, insurance, and common area maintenance costs that tenants currently pay, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nOur retail centers may depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants.\nSome of our retail centers are anchored by large tenants. At any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. As a result, our tenants, including our anchor and other major tenants, may fail to comply with their contractual obligations to us, seek concessions in order to continue operations, or declare bankruptcy, any of which could result in the termination of such tenants\u2019 leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. In addition, certain of our tenants may cease operations while continuing to pay rent, which could decrease customer traffic, thereby decreasing sales for our other tenants at the applicable retail property. In addition, mergers or consolidations among retail establishments could result in the closure of existing stores or the duplication or geographic overlapping of store locations, which could include stores at our retail centers.\nLoss of, or a store closure by, an anchor store or major tenant could significantly reduce our occupancy level or the rent that we receive from our retail centers. We may be unable to re-lease vacated space or to re-lease it on comparable or more favorable terms, or at all. In the event of default by an anchor store or major tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with such parties.\nCertain of our leases at our retail centers contain \u201cco-tenancy\u201d or \u201cgo-dark\u201d provisions, which, if triggered, may allow tenants to pay reduced rent, cease operations, or terminate their leases, which could adversely affect our performance or the value of the applicable retail property.\nCertain of the leases at our retail centers contain \u201cco-tenancy\u201d provisions that establish conditions related to a tenant\u2019s obligation to remain open, the amount of rent payable, or a tenant\u2019s obligation to continue occupying space, including (i) the presence of an anchor tenant, (ii) the continued operation of an anchor tenant\u2019s store, and (iii) minimum occupancy levels at the applicable property. If a co-tenancy provision is triggered by a failure of any of these conditions, a tenant could have the right to cease operations, to terminate its lease early, or to a reduction of its rent. In addition, certain of the leases at our retail centers contain \u201cgo-dark\u201d provisions that allow the tenant to cease operations while continuing to pay rent. This could result in decreased customer traffic at the property, thereby decreasing sales for our other tenants at such property, which may result in our other tenants being unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. Such provisions may also result in lower rental revenue generated under the applicable leases. To the extent co-tenancy or go-dark provisions in our leases result\nin lower revenue or tenant sales, tenants\u2019 rights to terminate their leases early, or to a reduction of their rent, our performance or the value of the applicable retail center could be adversely affected.\nThe value of our development-for-hold projects and commercial properties is affected by a number of factors.\nWe have significant investments in various commercial real estate properties and development-for-hold projects. Weakness in the real estate sector, especially in Hawai\u2018i, difficulty in obtaining or renewing project-level financing, and changes in our investment and redevelopment and development-for-hold strategy, among other factors, may affect the fair value of these real estate assets. If the undiscounted cash flows of our commercial properties, or redevelopment or development-for-hold projects, were to decline below the carrying value of those assets, we would be required to recognize an impairment loss if the fair value of those assets were below their carrying value.\nWe may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of properties that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth.\nOur business strategy involves the acquisition of retail, office, industrial, and other properties. These activities require us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria. We evaluate the market of available properties and may attempt to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist. We may be unable to acquire properties that we have identified as potential acquisition opportunities due to various factors, including but not limited to, the inability to (i) negotiate terms agreeable to the parties involved, (ii) satisfy conditions to closing, or (iii) finance the acquisition on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions, including ones that we are subsequently not able to complete. If we are unable to acquire properties on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nWe face competition for the acquisition and development of real estate properties, which may impede our ability to grow our operations or may increase the cost of these activities.\nWe compete with many other entities for the acquisition of commercial real estate and land suitable for new developments, including other REITs, private institutional investors, and other owner-operators of commercial real estate. Larger REITs may enjoy competitive advantages that result from a lower cost of capital. These competitors may increase the market prices we would have to pay in order to acquire properties. If we are unable to acquire properties that meet our criteria at prices we deem reasonable, our ability to grow may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with real estate construction and development.\nOur redevelopment and development-for-hold projects are subject to risks relating to our ability to complete our projects on time and on budget. Factors that may result in a development project exceeding budget or being prevented from completion include, but are not limited to: (i) our inability to secure sufficient financing or insurance on favorable terms, or at all; (ii) construction delays, defects, or cost overruns, which may increase project development costs; (iii) an increase in commodity or construction costs, including labor costs; (iv) the discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other environmental, culturally-sensitive, or related issues; (v) an inability to obtain, or a significant delay in obtaining, zoning, construction, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations; (vi) difficulty in complying with local, city, county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning, subdivision, utilities, and water quality, as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats; (vii) insufficient infrastructure capacity or availability (e.g., water, sewer and roads) to serve the needs of our projects; (viii) an inability to secure tenants necessary to support the project or maintain compliance with debt covenants; (ix) failure to achieve or sustain anticipated occupancy levels; (x) condemnation of all or parts of development or operating properties, which could adversely affect the value or viability of such projects; and (xi) instability in the financial industry could reduce the availability of financing.\nSignificant instability in the financial industry, may result in declining property values and increasing defaults on loans. This, in turn, could lead to increased regulations, tightened credit requirements, reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for virtually all borrowers. Deterioration in the credit environment may also impact us in other ways, including the credit or solvency of vendors, tenants, or joint venture partners, the ability of partners to fund their financial obligations to joint ventures and our access to mortgage financing for our own properties.\nCommercial real estate investments are relatively illiquid.\nOur ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, supply and demand, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that we will be able to sell any property for the price and other terms we seek, or that any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot estimate with certainty the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to complete the sale of a property. Factors that impede our ability to dispose of properties could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Land Operations Segment\nWe are subject to risks associated with real estate construction and development.\nOur development-for-sale projects are subject to risks that are similar to those described in the \u201cWe are subject to risks associated with real estate construction and development\u201d risk factor above, under the \u201cRisks Relating to Our Commercial Real Estate Segment\u201d section.\nSignificant instability in the financial industry may result in declining property values and increasing defaults on loans. This, in turn, could lead to increased regulations, tightened credit requirements, reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for virtually all borrowers. Fewer loan products and strict loan qualifications make it more difficult for borrowers to finance the purchase of units in our projects. Additionally, more stringent requirements to obtain financing for buyers of commercial properties make it significantly more difficult for us to sell commercial properties and may negatively impact the sales prices and other terms of such sales. Deterioration in the credit environment may also impact us in other ways, including the credit or solvency of customers, vendors, or joint venture partners, the ability of partners to fund their financial obligations to joint ventures and our access to mortgage financing for our own properties.\nGovernmental entities have adopted or may adopt regulatory requirements that may restrict our development activity.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that affect the land development process, including zoning and permitted land uses. Government entities have adopted or may approve regulations or laws that could negatively impact the availability of land and development opportunities. It is possible that requirements will be imposed on developers that could adversely affect our ability to develop projects in the affected markets or could require that we satisfy additional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could delay development progress or increase the development costs to us.\nReal estate development projects are subject to warranty and construction defect claims, in the ordinary course of business, that can be significant.\nIn our development-for-sale projects, we are subject to warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The amounts payable under these claims, both in legal fees and remedying any construction defects, can be significant and could exceed the profits made from the project. As a consequence, we may maintain liability insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from contractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials, and create warranty and other reserves for projects based on historical experience and qualitative risks associated with the type of project built. Because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage, contractor arrangements and reserves will be adequate to address some or all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future. For example, contractual indemnities may be difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions, and certain claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered, and the availability of liability insurance for construction defects, could be limited or costly. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that such coverage will be adequate, available at an acceptable cost, or available at all.\nOur ability to use or lease agricultural lands for agricultural purposes may be limited by government regulation.\nGiven the large scale of our agricultural landholdings on Kauai, many of the third parties to whom we lease land for agricultural purposes may be characterized as large scale commercial agricultural operations. Legislation passed on Kauai placed restrictions on the ability of such operations to use land within specified distances of highways, schools, oceans, streams, residences, parks, care homes, hospitals and other similar uses, to grow crops other than ground cover. This legislation also put significant restrictions regarding, and public notification obligations concerning, pesticide use on such operations and limited their ability to use genetically modified organism (GMO) crops. In November 2016, the Kauai legislation was invalidated by the courts. If additional legislative agricultural restrictions are passed, such as restrictions on the use of pesticides, our ability to\nuse or lease lands for large scale agricultural purposes, and any rents that we can achieve for those lands, may be adversely affected.\nAgricultural land is illiquid and difficult to value.\nEven if qualified farm lessees can be identified and engaged in leases, agricultural operations are high risk by nature and turnover can be expected. From a landlord\u2019s perspective, agricultural leases produce only modest rents that could imply a valuation of the land that could materially understate other methods of appraising asset value.\nThe lack of water for agricultural irrigation could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Land Operations segment.\nIt is crucial to have access to sufficient, reliable and affordable sources of water in order to conduct sustainable agricultural activity on our lands. Existing infrastructure serving these agricultural lands rely on the collection and transmission of surface waters. If the ability to divert surface waters for agricultural use is limited or there is insufficient rainfall on an extended basis, this would have a significant, adverse effect on the utility of the land and our ability to employ the land in active agricultural use. On Maui and Kauai, where our agricultural lands are located, there are regulatory and legal challenges to water diversion from streams.\nWater availability also is critical to the successful implementation of farming plans on those lands purchased from us by Mahi Pono Holdings LLC (\"Mahi Pono\") in conjunction with our sale of certain agricultural landholdings on Maui (the \"Agricultural Land Sale\"). As described in our public filings associated with that sale, as well as Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, if Mahi Pono is unable to secure sufficient water to support the agricultural plans for which it purchased the lands, this could trigger certain financial obligations.\nOur power sales contracts could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.\nOur power sales contracts expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, which could adversely affect Land Operations profitability.\nThe market for power sales in Hawai\u2018i is limited.\nThe power distribution systems in Hawai\u2018i are small and island-specific; currently, there is no ability to move power generated on one island to any other island. In addition, Hawai\u2018i law generally limits the ability of independent power producers, such as us, to sell their output to firms other than the respective utilities on each island, without themselves becoming utilities and subject to the State\u2019s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) regulation. Further, any sales of electricity by us to the utilities on each island are subject to the approval of the PUC. Unlike some areas in the Mainland, Hawai\u2018i\u2019s independent power producers have no ability to use utility infrastructure to transfer power to other locations.\nGovernmental entities have adopted or may adopt regulatory requirements related to our dams, reservoirs, and other water infrastructure that may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are subject to inspections and regulations that apply to certain of our dams, reservoirs, and other water infrastructure. Certain of these facilities have deficiencies noted by the State of Hawai\u2018i, which we are working with the regulators to resolve. It is possible that current or future requirements imposed on landowners and dam owners/operators may require that we satisfy additional administrative and regulatory requirements and thereby increase the holding costs to us and/or decrease the operational utility of the subject facilities.\nRisks Related to Our Materials & Construction Segment\nOur Materials & Construction segment\u2019s revenue growth and profitability are dependent on factors outside of our control.\nOur Materials & Construction segment\u2019s ability to grow its revenues and improve profitability may be impacted by factors outside of our control, which include, but are not limited to: (i) decreased government funding for infrastructure projects; (ii) reduced spending by private sector customers resulting from poor economic conditions in Hawai\u2018i; (iii) an increased number of competitors; (iv) less success in competitive bidding for contracts; (v) a decline in transportation and logistical costs, which may result in customers purchasing material from sources located outside of Hawai\u2018i in a more cost-efficient manner; (vi) limitations on access to necessary working capital and investment capital to sustain growth; and (vii) inability to hire and retain essential personnel and to acquire equipment to support growth.\nEconomic downturns or reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects could reduce our revenues and profits from our materials and construction businesses.\nThe segment\u2019s products are used in public infrastructure projects, which include the construction, maintenance and improvement of highways, streets, roads, airport runways and similar projects. Our materials and construction businesses, including our aggregates business, are highly dependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. We cannot be assured of the existence, amount and timing of appropriations for spending on these and other future projects, including state and federal spending on roads and highways. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects (including federal funding), and other competing priorities for available state, local and federal funds. State spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding. The segment is reliant upon contracts with the City and County of Honolulu, the State of Hawai\u2018i and the Federal Government for a significant portion of its revenues. If revenues and profits are impacted by economic downturns or reductions in government funding, the segment\u2019s long-lived assets and goodwill may become impaired.\nWe may be unsuccessful in identifying or completing any strategic alternative of our Materials & Construction segment or, if we are successful, any such strategic alternative may be less than our carrying value, which may result in additional non-cash impairment charges.\nOur pursuit of strategic alternatives for our Materials & Construction businesses, either together as a group or individually, may not result in the identification or consummation of any transaction(s) or may not be on terms that are favorable to us. The process of pursuing strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations, and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected and may result in additional non-cash impairment charges. Any potential transactions, and the related valuations, would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among others, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties, and the availability of financing to potential buyer(s) on reasonable terms. Identification of a single buyer for the Materials & Construction segment as a whole, due to its size, may be difficult, while selling the Materials & Construction businesses separately may result in unforeseen consequences, which may result in the Company being unable to recover its carrying value of the Materials & Construction businesses or related disposal group. In addition, acceleration of the timing of a potential transaction may result in additional non-cash impairment charges.\nWe may face community opposition to the operation or expansion of quarries or other facilities.\nQuarries and other facilities require special and conditional use permits to operate. Permitting and licensing applications and proceedings and regulatory enforcement proceedings are open to public scrutiny and comment. In addition, the Makakilo quarry is adjacent to residential areas and heavy equipment and explosives are used in the mining process. As a result, our Materials & Construction operations may be subject to community opposition and adverse publicity that may have a negative effect on operations and delay or limit any future expansion or development of operations.\nSignificant contracts may be canceled, or we may be disqualified from bidding for new contracts.\nGovernmental entities typically have the right to cancel their contracts with our construction businesses at any time with payment generally only for the work already completed plus a negotiated compensatory overhead recovery amount. In addition, our construction businesses could be prohibited from bidding on certain governmental contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities, such as maintaining an acceptable safety record.\nIf our materials and construction businesses are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that we are ultimately awarded, the segment may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.\nThe majority of the Materials & Construction segment\u2019s revenues are derived from \u201cquantity pricing\u201d (fixed unit price) contracts. Quantity pricing contracts require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Expected profits on contracts are realized only if costs are accurately estimated and then successfully controlled. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected.\nIf our materials and construction businesses are unable to attract and retain key personnel and skilled labor, or encounter labor difficulties, the ability to bid for and successfully complete contracts may be negatively impacted.\nThe ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables our materials and construction businesses to successfully bid for and profitably complete their work. This includes members of management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, and foremen. The segment\u2019s future success also will depend on its ability to hire, train and retain, or to attract, when needed, highly skilled management personnel. If competition for these employees is intense, it could be difficult to hire and retain the personnel necessary to support operations. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly skilled employees, segment operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted.\nA majority of segment personnel are unionized. Any work stoppage or other labor dispute involving unionized workforce, or inability to renew contracts with the unions, could have an adverse effect on operations.\nOur construction and construction-related businesses may fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of our paving contracts.\nAsphalt paving contracts have penalties for late completion. In most instances, projects must be completed within an allotted number of business or calendar days from the time the notice to proceed is received, subject to allowances for additional days due to weather delays or additional work requested by the customer. If our construction businesses subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled, we may be responsible for contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages, an amount assessed per day beyond the contractually allotted days, at the discretion of the customer. Under these circumstances, the total project cost could exceed original estimates and could result in a loss of profit or a loss on the project. Additionally, our construction businesses enter into lump sum and quantity pricing contracts where profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control, which can cause actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid.\nTiming of the award and performance of new contracts could have an adverse effect on Materials & Construction segment operating results and cash flow.\nIt is generally very difficult to predict whether and when bids for new projects will be offered for tender, as these projects frequently involve a lengthy and complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, segment results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial.\nThe uncertainty of the timing of contract awards after a winning bid is submitted may also present difficulties in matching the size of equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases, our materials and construction businesses may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment than is currently required, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts.\nIn addition, the timing of the revenues, earnings and cash flows from contracts can be delayed by a number of factors, including delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliers and services from subcontractors and changes in the scope of work to be performed.\nDependence on a limited number of customers could adversely affect our materials and construction businesses and results of operations.\nDue to the size and nature of the segment\u2019s construction contracts, one or a few customers, such as the Federal Government, the State of Hawai\u2018i, and the various counties in Hawai\u2018i, have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of consolidated segment revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. Similarly, segment backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. The loss of business from any such customer, or a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer, could have an adverse effect on our materials and construction businesses or results of operations.\nOur materials and construction businesses are likely to require more capital over the longer term.\nThe property and machinery needed to produce aggregate products and perform asphaltic concrete paving contracts are expensive. The segment\u2019s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fund these expenditures depends on future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business, and other factors affecting operations, many of which are beyond our control. If the segment is unable to generate sufficient cash to operate its businesses, it may be required, among other things, to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.\nAn inability to obtain bonding could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that our materials and construction businesses are able to pursue.\nAs is customary in the construction industry, we may be required to provide surety bonds to our customers to secure our performance under construction contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in relationship to the amount of backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. The inability to obtain adequate bonding would limit the amount that our construction businesses are able to bid on new contracts and could have an adverse effect on the segment\u2019s future revenues and business prospects.\nOur Materials & Construction segment operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance.\nSegment employees are subject to the usual hazards associated with performing construction activities on road construction sites, plants and quarries. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, auto insurance and other types of insurance, all in amounts consistent with our materials and construction businesses\u2019 risk of loss and industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities incurred in operations.\nInsurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of the segment\u2019s safety program. If insurance claims or costs were above our estimates, our materials and construction businesses might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims, which could impact their ability to maintain or expand their operations.\nEnvironmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our materials and construction businesses\u2019 ability to conduct business and could require significant expenditures.\nSegment operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, climate change and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water. Our materials and construction businesses could be held liable for such contamination created not only from their own activities but also from the historical activities of others on properties that the segment acquires or leases. Segment operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third-party property damage or personal injury claims. In addition, these laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming, increasingly stringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied.\nCompliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures for, among other things, equipment not currently possessed, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to segment activities.\nShort supplies and volatility in the costs of fuel, energy and raw materials may adversely affect our materials and construction businesses.\nOur materials and construction businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel, electricity and other energy sources for production and transportation. The financial results of these businesses have at times been affected by the high costs of these energy sources. Significant increases in costs, or reduced availability of these energy sources, have and may in the future reduce financial results. Moreover, fluctuations in the supply and costs of these energy sources can make planning business operations more difficult. We do not hedge our fuel price risk, but instead focus on volume-related price reductions, fuel efficiency, alternative fuel sources, consumption and the natural hedge created by the ability to increase aggregates prices.\nSimilarly, segment operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt, which serves as a key raw material in the production of asphaltic concrete. Liquid asphalt is subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations, which are generally correlated to the price of crude oil, though not as closely as diesel or gasoline, and are beyond the control of our materials and construction businesses. Accordingly, significant increases in the price of crude oil will have an adverse impact on the financial results of the Materials & Construction segment due to higher costs of production of asphaltic concrete. Conversely, significant declines in the price of oil had, and in the future may have, an adverse impact on our material and construction sales of liquid asphalt concrete, due to lower costs of importing asphalt to Hawai\u2018i, which may result in customers sourcing liquid asphalt from competition located outside of Hawai\u2018i.", "PERMNO": 13429, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "ALEX"}
