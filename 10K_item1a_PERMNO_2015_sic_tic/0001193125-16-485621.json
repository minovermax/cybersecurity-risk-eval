{"cik": "1044777", "company": "VASCO DATA SECURITY INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, which we consider the most significant, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, there are a number of less significant and other general risk factors that could affect our future results. If any of the events described in the risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We have grouped our Risk Factors under captions that we believe describe various categories of potential risk. For the reader\u2019s convenience, we have not duplicated risk factors that could be considered to be included in more than one category.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA significant portion of our sales are to a limited number of customers. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could have an adverse effect on revenues and profits.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, many of which are financial institutions. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could adversely affect our operations and results. In fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, our top 10 largest customers contributed 50%, 46%, and 40%, respectively, of total worldwide revenue. In 2015 and 2014, Rabobank contributed 30% and 12%, respectively, of total revenue principally due to an order for card readers incorporating our CrontoSign technology.\nIn fiscal 2014 and 2013, HSBC contributed approximately 11% and 18%, respectively, of total worldwide revenue. HSBC has no long term contractual commitment to purchase products or services from us. HSBC and its affiliates only make purchase commitments pursuant to individual purchase orders placed with us from time to time, which are subject to our acceptance. The general commercial framework that applies to such purchases by HSBC may be terminated by HSBC at any time, without cause, on 90 days\u2019 notice to us without payment of any termination charge by HSBC.\nThe return of a worldwide recession and/or an increase in the concern over the European sovereign debt crisis may further impact our business.\nOur business is subject to economic conditions that may fluctuate in the major markets in which we operate. Factors that could cause economic conditions to fluctuate include, without limitation, recession, inflation, deflation, interest rates, unemployment, consumer debt levels, general retail or commercial markets and consumer or business purchasing power or preferences.\nWhile it appears that circumstances that led to the sovereign debt crisis have abated, many significant economic issues have not been addressed fully. As a result, we expect that Europe will continue to face difficult economic conditions in 2016. If global economic and financial market conditions remain uncertain and/or weak for an extended period of time, any of the following factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\nslower consumer or business spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from customers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, increased inventories, and lower gross margins;\n\u2022\ncontinued volatility in the global markets and fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts or purchase orders in foreign currencies could negatively impact our reported financial results and condition;\n\u2022\ncontinued volatility in the prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins, and ultimately our profitability;\n\u2022\nif our customers experience declining revenues, or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, inability of customers to timely meet their payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense;\n\u2022\nin the event of a contraction of our sales, dated inventory may result in a need for increased obsolescence reserves;\n\u2022\na severe financial difficulty experienced by our customers may cause them to become insolvent or cease business operations, which could reduce the availability of our products to consumers; and\n\u2022\nany difficulty or inability on the part of manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain in obtaining sufficient financing to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.\nWhile we believe that many of the effects of the recession and credit crisis have abated, we are unable to predict potential future economic conditions, disruptions in the sovereign debt markets or other financial markets, the Euro Monetary Union or the European Union, or the effect of any such disruption or disruptions on our business and results of operations, but the consequences may be materially adverse. We believe that our business in the Banking market in Europe would be impacted most directly by any such disruption and that the consequences may be materially adverse, as approximately 68% of our consolidated revenues originated in the EMEA region in 2015.\nDisruptions in markets or the European Union may affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe believe our financial resources and current borrowing arrangements are adequate to meet our operating needs. However, disruptions in the sovereign debt markets or other financial markets, the Euro Monetary Union or the European Union, could materially adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources and expose us to additional currency fluctuation risk. Sufficiently adverse effects could cause us to modify our business plans.\nFurthermore, in an adverse economic environment there is a risk that customers may delay their orders until the economic conditions improve further. If a significant number of orders are delayed for an indefinite period of time, our revenue and cash receipts may not be sufficient to meet the operating needs of the business. If this is the case, we may need to significantly reduce our workforce, sell certain of our assets, enter into strategic relationships or business combinations, discontinue some or all of our operations, or take other similar restructuring actions. While we expect that these actions would result in a reduction of recurring costs, they also may result in a reduction of recurring revenue and cash receipts. It is also likely that we would incur substantial non-recurring costs to implement one or more of these restructuring actions.\nWe have a long operating history, but only modest accumulated profit.\nAlthough we have reported net income of $42.1 million, $33.5 million, and $11.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, our retained earnings were only $168 million at December 31, 2015. Over our 24 year operating history, we have operated at a loss for many of those years. In the current uncertain economic environment, it may be difficult for us to sustain our recent levels of profitability.\nWe derive revenue from a limited number of products and do not have a broadly-diversified product base.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of authentication products. We also anticipate that a substantial portion of our future revenue, if any, will also be derived from these products and related services. If the sale of these products and services is impeded for any reason and we have not diversified our product offerings, our business and results of operations would be negatively impacted.\nThe sales cycle for our products and technology is long, and we may incur substantial expenses for sales that do not occur when anticipated.\nThe sales cycle for our products, which is the period of time between the identification of a potential customer and completion of the sale, is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little control. If revenue falls significantly below anticipated levels, our business would be seriously harmed.\nA typical sales cycle in the Banking market is often six months or more. Larger Banking transactions may take up to 18 months or more. Purchasing decisions for our products and systems may be subject to delays due to many factors that are not within our control, such as:\n\u2022\nThe time required for a prospective customer to recognize the need for our products;\n\u2022\nThe significant expense of many data security products and network systems;\n\u2022\nCustomers\u2019 internal budgeting processes; and\n\u2022\nInternal procedures customers may require for the approval of large purchases.\nAs our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels, a small fluctuation in the timing of sales can cause our operating results to vary significantly between periods.\nWe have a great dependence on a limited number of suppliers and the loss of their manufacturing capability could materially impact our operations.\nIn the event that the supply of components or finished products is interrupted or relations with any of our principal vendors is terminated, there could be increased costs and considerable delay in finding suitable replacement sources to manufacture our products. The majority of our products are manufactured by four independent vendors domiciled in Hong Kong and Macau. Our hardware DIGIPASSES are assembled at facilities in mainland China. The importation of these products from China exposes us to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the Chinese government, political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China or developments in the United States or European Union that are adverse to trade, including enactment of protectionist legislation.\nWe order processors well in advance of expected use and produce finished goods prior to the receipt of customer orders. If orders are not received, we could suffer losses related to the write down or write off of inventory that cannot be sold at full value.\nIn an attempt to minimize the risk of not having an adequate supply of component parts to meet demand, especially in situations where we have been notified that key processors will no longer be manufactured, we purchase multiple years\u2019 supply of processors based on internal forecasts of demand. In addition, to meet customers\u2019 demands for accelerated delivery of product, we produce finished product for existing customers before we receive the order from the customer. Should our forecasts of future demand be inaccurate or if we produce product that is never ordered, we could incur substantial losses related to the write down or write off of our inventory.\nOur success depends on establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with other companies to develop, market, and distribute our technology and products and, in some cases, to incorporate our technology into their products.\nPart of our business strategy is to enter into strategic alliances and other cooperative arrangements with other companies in our industry. We currently are involved in cooperative efforts with respect to the incorporation of our products into products of others, research and development efforts, marketing efforts and reseller arrangements. None of these relationships are exclusive, and some of our strategic partners also have cooperative relationships with certain of our competitors. If we are unable to enter cooperative arrangements in the future or if we lose any of our current strategic or cooperative relationships, our business could be harmed. We do not control the time and resources devoted to such activities by parties with whom we have relationships. In addition, we may not have the resources available to satisfy our commitments, which may adversely affect these relationships. These relationships may not continue, may not be commercially successful, or may require our expenditure of significant financial, personnel and administrative resources from time to time. Further, certain of our products and services compete with the products and services of our strategic partners.\nWe may not be able to maintain effective product distribution channels, which could result in decreased revenue.\nWe rely on both our direct sales force and an indirect channel distribution strategy for the sale and marketing of our products. We may be unable to attract distributors, resellers and integrators, as planned, that can market our products effectively and provide timely and cost-effective customer support and service. There is also a risk that some or all of our distributors, resellers or integrators may be acquired, may change their business models or may go out of business, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, our distributors, integrators and resellers may carry competing lines of products. The loss of important sales personnel, distributors, integrators or resellers could adversely affect us.\nWe depend on our key personnel for the success of our business and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business or could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.\nOur success and our ability to manage our business depend, in large part, upon the efforts and continued service of our senior management team. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. It could be difficult for us to find replacements for our key personnel, as competition for such personnel is intense. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets, which could reduce the market value of our securities.\nIf we fail to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can attract other highly qualified personnel in the future. If we cannot retain or are unable to hire such key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the distribution of income among the various countries in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including the impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions, changes in share-based compensation expense, and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods.\nOur worldwide income tax provisions and other tax accruals may be insufficient if any taxing authorities assume taxing positions that are contrary to our positions.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other taxes such as sales and VAT taxes. There are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany agreements to purchase intellectual properties, allocate revenue and allocate costs, each of which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable, we cannot be certain that the final tax authority review of these matters will not differ materially from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and other tax accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits, or other tax accruals, in the period in which such determination is made, and consequently, on our results of operations for such period.\nAny acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition or results.\nWe may make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies. Should we do so, our failure to successfully structure or manage the acquisitions could seriously harm our financial condition or operating results. The expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized. In connection with our acquisition of Silanis and any future purchases, we will face additional financial and operational risks, including:\n\u2022\nDifficulty in assimilating the operations, technology and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nDisruption in our business because of the allocation of resources to consummate these transactions and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing business;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in retaining key technical and managerial personnel from acquired companies;\n\u2022\nDilution of our stockholders, if we issue equity to fund these transactions;\n\u2022\nReduced liquidity, increased debt and higher amortization expenses;\n\u2022\nAssumption of operating losses, increased expenses and liabilities;\n\u2022\nOur relationships with existing employees, customers and business partners may be weakened or terminated as a result of these transactions;\n\u2022\nDiscovery of unanticipated issues and liabilities;\n\u2022\nFailure to meet expected returns; and\n\u2022\nFailure to cause acquired financial reporting and internal control processes to be compliant with requirements applicable to companies subject to SEC reporting.\nReported revenue may fluctuate widely due to the interpretation or application of accounting rules.\nOur sales arrangements often include multiple elements, including hardware, software and maintenance. The accounting rules for such arrangements are complex and subject to change from time to time. Small changes in circumstances could cause wide deviations in the timing of reported revenue.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers, solution partners and channel partners include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement and, in some cases, for damages caused by us to property or persons. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Market\nWe face significant competition and if we lose or fail to gain market share our financial results will suffer.\nThe market for computer and network security products and services is highly competitive. Our competitors include organizations that provide computer and network security products based upon approaches similar to and different from those that we employ. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products.\nA decrease of average selling prices for our products and services could adversely affect our business.\nThe average selling prices for our solution offerings may decline as a result of competitive pricing pressures or a change in our mix of products, software and services. In addition, competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Furthermore, we anticipate that the average selling prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles. To maintain or realize higher prices and gross margins, we must continue to develop and introduce new products and services that incorporate new technologies or increased functionality. If we experience pricing pressures or fail to develop new products, our revenue and gross margins could decline, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and our failure to obtain capital would interfere with our growth strategy.\nOur ability to obtain financing will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor interest. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of any financing unattractive. They may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments, defer our product development activities, or delay the introduction of new products.\nWe experience variations in quarterly operating results and sales are subject to seasonality, both of which may result in a volatile stock price.\nIn the future, as in the past, our quarterly operating results may vary significantly, resulting in a volatile stock price. Factors affecting our operating results include:\n\u2022\nThe level of competition;\n\u2022\nThe size, timing, cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders;\n\u2022\nNew product announcements or introductions by competitors;\n\u2022\nTechnological changes in the market for data security products including the adoption of new technologies and standards;\n\u2022\nChanges in pricing by competitors;\n\u2022\nOur ability to develop, introduce and market new products and product enhancements on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u2022\nComponent costs and availability;\n\u2022\nOur success in expanding our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022\nMarket acceptance of new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions in the countries in which we operate.\nWe also experience seasonality in all markets. These seasonal trends are most notable in the summer months, particularly in Europe, when many businesses defer purchase decisions.\nOur stock price may be volatile for reasons other than variations in our quarterly operating results.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nDifferences between actual operating results and results estimated by analysts that follow our stock and provide estimates of our results to the market;\n\u2022\nDifferences between guidance relative to financial results, if given, and actual results;\n\u2022\nChanges in market valuations of other technology companies;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nAdditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nFuture sales of common stock;\n\u2022\nTrading volume fluctuations; and\n\u2022\nReactions by investors to uncertainties in the world economy and financial markets.\nA small group of persons control a substantial amount of our common stock and could delay or prevent a change of control.\nOur Board of Directors, our officers and their immediate families and related entities beneficially own approximately 25%, with Mr. T. Kendall Hunt beneficially owning approximately 23%, of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and our largest\nstockholder, Mr. Hunt may exercise substantial control over our future direction and operation and such concentration of control may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control and may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our charter and of Delaware law make a takeover of our company more difficult.\nOur corporate charter and Delaware law contain provisions, such as a class of authorized but unissued preferred stock which may be issued by our board without stockholder approval that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company. Delaware law also limits business combinations with interested stockholders. These provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or a change in our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of blank check preferred stock may reduce voting power of common stock and may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control.\nOur corporate charter authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, rights, powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors, including such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors without further stockholder approval. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. In addition, the authorized shares of preferred stock and common stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control.\nRisks Related to Technology and Intellectual Property\nTechnological changes occur rapidly in our industry and our development of new products is critical to maintain our revenue.\nThe introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Our future revenue growth and operating profit will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our current products and develop innovative products to distinguish ourselves from the competition and to meet customers\u2019 changing needs in the data security industry. Security-related product developments and technology innovations by others may adversely affect our competitive position and we may not successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology, industry standards or customer requirements on a timely basis.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber security incidents and other disruptions.\nOur use of technology is increasing and is critical in three primary areas of our business:\n1. Software and information systems that we use to help us run our business more efficiently and cost effectively;\n2. The products we have traditionally sold and continue to sell to our customers for integration into their software applications contain technology that incorporates the use of secret numbers and encryption technology; and\n3. Products and services providing security through our servers (or in the cloud from our customers\u2019 perspective).\nA cyber incident in any of these areas of our business could disrupt our ability to take orders or deliver product to our customers, cause us to suffer significant monetary and other losses and significant reputational harm, or substantially impair our ability to grow the business. We expect that there are likely to be hacking attempts intended to impede the performance of our products, disrupt our services and harm our reputation as a company, as the processes used by computer hackers to access or sabotage technology products, services and networks are rapidly evolving in sophistication.\nIn July 2011, we experienced a cyber incident related to DigiNotar B.V. See Part I. Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, Part II. Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of the hacking incident at DigiNotar B.V., the termination of DigiNotar B.V\u2019s registration as a certification service provider and DigiNotar B.V.\u2019s bankruptcy. See Part I. Item 3 - Legal Proceedings for a description of legal proceedings related to the cyber security incident at DigiNotar B.V. We may incur additional losses from discontinued operations resulting from these events as a result of unanticipated costs associated with DigiNotar B.V.\u2019s bankruptcy and potential claims that may arise in connection with the hacking incidents.\nOur products contain third-party, open-source software and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open-source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products or otherwise result in claims of infringement.\nOur products are distributed with software programs licensed to us by third-party authors under \u201copen-source\u201d licenses, which may include the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser Public License, the BSD License and the Apache License. These open-source software programs include, without limitation, Linux, Apache, Openssl, IPTables, Tcpdump, Postfix, Cyrus, Perl, Squid ,Snort, Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Puppet. These third-party, open-source programs are typically licensed to us for no fee and the underlying license agreements generally require us to make available to users the source code for such programs, as well as the source code for any modifications or derivative works we create based on these third-party, open-source software programs.\nWe do not believe that we have created any modifications or derivative works to, an extended version of, or works based on, any open-source software programs referenced above. We include instructions to users on how to obtain copies of the relevant open-source code and licenses.\nWe do not provide end users a copy of the source code to our proprietary software because we believe that the manner in which our proprietary software is aligned or communicates with the relevant open-source programs does not create a modification, derivative work or extended version of, or a work based on, that open-source program requiring the distribution of our proprietary source code.\nOur ability to commercialize our products by incorporating third-party, open-source software may be restricted because, among other reasons:\n\u2022\nthe terms of open-source license agreements are unclear and subject to varying interpretations, which could result in unforeseen obligations regarding our proprietary products or claims of infringement;\n\u2022\nit may be difficult to determine the developers of open-source software and whether such licensed software infringes another party\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncompetitors will have greater access to information by obtaining these open source products, which may help them develop competitive products; and\n\u2022\nopen-source software potentially increases customer support costs because licensees can modify the software and potentially introduce errors.\nWe must continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel for our research and development department.\nThe market for highly skilled technicians is highly competitive. If we fail to attract, train, assimilate and retain qualified technical personnel for our research and development department, we will experience delays in introductions of new or modified products, loss of clients and market share and a reduction in revenue.\nWe cannot be certain that our research and development activities will be successful.\nWhile management is committed to enhancing our current product offerings and introducing new products, we cannot be certain that our research and development activities will be successful. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient financial resources to identify and develop new technologies and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner, and we cannot ensure that any such products will be commercially successful if and when they are introduced.\nWe depend significantly upon our proprietary technology and intellectual property and the loss of or the successful challenge to our proprietary rights could require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could reduce revenue and increase our operating costs.\nWe currently rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection, and generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and with key vendors and suppliers.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the technology industry regarding intellectual property rights, and we may have to litigate to protect our proprietary technology.\nWe expect that companies in the computer and information security market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors increases. Any such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, cause product shipment delays, require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, harm our reputation, cause our customers to use our competitors\u2019 products or divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations, any of which could reduce revenue and increase our operating costs.\nOur patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.\nWe hold several patents in the United States and in other countries, which cover multiple aspects of our technology. The majority of our patents cover the DIGIPASS product line. These patents expire between 2021 and 2035. We do not believe patents expiring in 2016 will affect revenues, profitability, or increase competition. In addition to the issued patents, we also have several patents pending in the United States, Europe and other countries. There can be no assurance that we will continue to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that patents of others will not hinder our competitive advantage. Although certain of our security token technologies are patented, there are other organizations that offer token-type password generators incorporating challenge-response or response-only approaches that employ different technological solutions and compete with us for market share.\nWe are subject to warranty and product liability risks.\nA malfunction of or design defect in our products which results in a breach of a customer\u2019s data security could result in tort or warranty claims against us. We seek to reduce the risk of these losses by\nattempting to negotiate warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our sales agreements. However, these measures may ultimately prove ineffective in limiting our liability for damages.\nIn addition to any monetary liability for the failure of our products, an actual or perceived breach of network or data security at one of our customers could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products, and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the demand for our products. Similarly, an actual or perceived breach of network or data security within our own systems could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on the demand for our products.\nThere is significant government regulation of technology exports and to the extent we cannot meet the requirements of the regulations we may be prohibited from exporting some of our products, which could negatively impact our revenue.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to risks such as the imposition of government controls, new or changed export license requirements, restrictions on the export of critical technology, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. If we become unable to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis our business in those countries would no longer exist and our revenue would decrease dramatically. Certain of our products are subject to export controls under U.S. law. The list of products and countries for which export approval is required, and the regulatory policies with respect thereto, may be revised from time to time and our inability to obtain required approvals under these regulations could materially and adversely affect our ability to make international sales. Violations of export control and international trade laws could result in penalties, fines, adverse reputational consequences, and other materially adverse consequences. Reference is made to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-k with respect to the internal investigation regarding sales of VASCO products by a VASCO European subsidiary to a third party distributor which distributor may have resold such products to Iranian entities.\nWe employ cryptographic technology in our authentication products that uses complex mathematical formulations to establish network security systems.\nMany of our products are based on cryptographic technology. With cryptographic technology, a user is given a key that is required to encrypt and decode messages. The security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user\u2019s key and in part on the application of algorithms, which are advanced mathematical factoring equations. These codes may eventually be broken or become subject to government regulation regarding their use, which would render our technology and products less effective. The occurrence of any one of the following could result in a decline in demand for our technology and products:\n\u2022\nAny significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems, including the development of an easy factoring method or faster, more powerful computers;\n\u2022\nPublicity of the successful decoding of cryptographic messages or the misappropriation of keys; and\n\u2022\nIncreased government regulation limiting the use, scope or strength of cryptography.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nWe face a number of risks associated with our international operations, any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue.\nIn 2015, approximately 95% of our revenue and approximately 63% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2014, approximately 94% of our revenue and approximately 75% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. A severe economic decline in any of our major foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to exposures to changes in the economic conditions of our major foreign markets, we are subject to a number of risks any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue. These include:\n\u2022\nInconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nExport controls relating to our technology;\n\u2022\nDifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nWage and price controls;\n\u2022\nUncertain protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nImposition of trade barriers;\n\u2022\nDiffering technology standards;\n\u2022\nUncertain demand for electronic commerce;\n\u2022\nLinguistic and cultural differences;\n\u2022\nPolitical instability; and\n\u2022\nSocial unrest.\nWe are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations and risks, and improper management of that risk could result in large cash losses.\nBecause a significant number of our principal customers are located outside the United States, we expect that international sales will continue to generate a significant portion of our total revenue. We are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations and risks because the majority of our product costs are denominated in U.S. Dollars, whereas a significant portion of the sales and expenses of our foreign operating subsidiaries are denominated in various foreign currencies. A decrease in the value of any of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect our revenue and profitability in U.S. Dollars of our products sold in these markets. We do not currently hold forward exchange contracts to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. Dollars to offset currency rate fluctuations.\nWe must comply with governmental regulations setting environmental standards.\nGovernmental regulations setting environmental standards influence the design, components or operation of our products. New regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and, in some jurisdictions, regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may prevent us from selling our products in a certain country. In addition, these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components. In these cases, we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products, or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance. This could have an adverse effect on our revenues, gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results.\nWe are subject to the Restriction on the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC (also known as the \u201cRoHS Directive\u201d) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (also known as the \u201cWEEE Directive\u201d). These directives restrict the distribution of products containing certain substances, including lead, within applicable geographies and require a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances.\nThese directives affect the worldwide electronics and electronics components industries as a whole. If we or our customers fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could incur liabilities and fines and our operations could be suspended.\nWe or our suppliers may be impacted by new regulations related to climate change.\nIn addition to the European environmental regulations noted above, we or our suppliers may become subject to new laws enacted with regards to climate change. In the event that new laws are enacted or current laws are modified in countries in which we or our suppliers operate, our flow of product may be impacted and/or the costs of handling the potential waste associated with our products may increase dramatically, either of which could result in a significant negative impact on our ability to operate or operate profitably.\nThe effects of new regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals and derivatives ( collectively \u201cConflict Minerals\u201d) which may originate from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (collectively, \u201cCovered Countries\u201d). As a result, in August 2012 the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for companies using Conflict Minerals in their products, including products manufactured by third parties. Like many electronic devices, our products contain Conflict Minerals and are subject to the disclosure and reporting requirements. Compliance with these rules also requires due diligence including country of origin inquiries to determine the sources of Conflict Minerals used in our products.\nAs required, we filed our annual reports related to products manufactured in calendar 2014 and 2013. We reported that we determined we had no reason to believe Conflict Minerals used in our products may have originated in Covered Countries.\nWe may incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements. These requirements may affect pricing, sourcing and availability of Conflict Minerals used to produce our devices. We may be unable to verify the origin of all Conflict Minerals in our products. We may encounter challenges with customers and stakeholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free.\nU.S. investors may have difficulties in making claims for any breach of their rights as holders of shares because some of our assets and executives are not located in the United States.\nSeveral of our executives and key employees are residents of foreign countries, and a substantial portion of our assets and those of some of our executives and key employees are located in foreign countries. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on those persons located in foreign countries, or to enforce judgments against some of our executives and key employees based upon the securities or other laws of jurisdictions in those foreign countries.\nOur business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments increase the risks associated with our international activities.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, deal with and make sales to governmental or quasi-governmental customers in countries known to experience corruption, particularly certain countries in the Middle East, Africa, East Asia and South America, and further expansion of our international selling efforts may involve additional regions. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents or channel partners that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, even though\nthese parties are not always subject to our control. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, including suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Violations of the U.K. Bribery Act may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 88203, "SIC": 3669, "TIC": "OSPN"}
