Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this report, and in our other public filings. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the risk factors described when evaluating our business.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company and we have not yet generated any revenues. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in December 2000, including consolidated net losses of $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $146.4 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including developing our manufacturing capabilities and preclinical and clinical development activities. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings or strategic collaborations. We have not completed pivotal clinical trials for any product candidate and it will be several years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates have received approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share for our product candidates in those markets.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022\ninitiate, expand or accelerate preclinical and clinical development activities for our lead product candidate, MYDICAR, including with respect to clinical trials of MYDICAR for heart failure for reduced ejection fraction or HFrEF (also referred to as systolic heart failure). Ongoing and planned clinical trials of MYDICAR for HFrEF include CUPID 2, CUPID 3, the LVAD trial, the AAV1 NAb positive trial, the viral shedding trial and a higher dose trial. If supported by data, we also plan to conduct preclinical and potentially clinical activities to evaluate MYDICAR for the treatment of AVF maturation failure, and clinical trials of MYDICAR for the treatment of heart failure for preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, (also referred to as diastolic heart failure) and other indications such as PAH;\n\u2022\nfurther validate and develop the manufacturing process for MYDICAR and our companion diagnostic, including commercial scale-up and contract for the construction and operation of one or more commercial manufacturing facilities, and validate and develop manufacturing processes for our other product candidates and any related companion diagnostics;\n\u2022\nadvance our additional preclinical assets, including mSCF gene therapy and our small molecule platform targeting SERCA2 enzymes;\n\u2022\ncontinue our research and preclinical development of our product candidates and seek to identify and validate additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory and marketing approvals for MYDICAR and its companion diagnostic and any other product candidate that successfully completes clinical trials;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure in the United States to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022\nacquire rights to other product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nchange or add manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nmake milestone or other payments under any in-license or collaboration agreement;\n\u2022\nattract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022\ncreate additional infrastructure to support our operations as a public company and our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022\nexperience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above.\nThe net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. In any particular quarter or quarters, our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nOur ability to generate meaningful revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, and the ability of any third party with which we may partner, to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to, commercialize our product candidates and any related companion diagnostics. We do not anticipate generating revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future, if ever. If any of our product candidates fail in clinical trials or if any of our product candidates or any related companion diagnostics do not gain regulatory approval, or if any of our product candidates and any related companion diagnostics, if approved, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:\n\u2022\ncompleting research and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nseeking and obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates for which we complete clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndeveloping a sustainable, scalable, reproducible, and transferable manufacturing process for our vectors and product candidates;\n\u2022\nautomating, validating and seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals for our companion diagnostic on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nestablishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate (in amount and quality) products and services to support clinical development and, if approved, the market demand for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nlaunching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either by establishing a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure, or by collaborating with a partner;\n\u2022\nobtaining market acceptance of any approved products and gene therapy as a viable treatment option;\n\u2022\naddressing any competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nimplementing additional internal systems and infrastructure, as needed;\n\u2022\nidentifying and validating new product candidates;\n\u2022\nnegotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n\u2022\nmaintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u2022\nattracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, the EMA, or other foreign regulatory authorities to perform clinical trials and other studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of any approved products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nFailure to comply with covenants in our existing loan agreement or satisfy certain conditions of the loan agreement, could harm our liquidity, financial condition, business, operating results and prospects.\nUnder our loan and security agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. and its affiliate Hercules Technology III, L.P., which we refer to collectively as Hercules or the Lenders, in August 2014 we borrowed $10.0 million from the Lenders and we have the option to borrow up to $15.0 million through June 30, 2015, subject to the satisfaction of certain funding conditions related to our clinical development of MYDICAR. The loan agreement requires us to comply with restrictive covenants, including restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness; encumber the collateral securing the loan agreement; acquire, own or make investments; repurchase or redeem stock or other equity securities; declare or pay any cash dividend or make a cash distribution on any class of stock or other equity interest; transfer a material portion of our assets; acquire other businesses; or merge or consolidate with or into any other business organization. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions to borrow additional amounts, we may not be able to draw-down additional funds from the loan agreement. Moreover, an uncured breach of any of the covenants or other event of default under the loan agreement could lead to an event of default under the loan agreement. If any event of default occurs, then outstanding amounts under the loan agreement may become due and payable immediately, but we may not have access to such amounts on reasonable terms or at all, which could harm our liquidity, business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nIf we enter into additional debt or credit financing arrangements with the consent of our existing lenders, the terms of such additional debt or credit arrangements could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility. In the event we must cease operations and liquidate our assets, the rights of our existing lenders and any other holder of our outstanding debt would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts, preparation for commercial manufacturing or other operations.\nWe are currently advancing our lead product candidate, MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF, through clinical development and other product candidates through preclinical development. Developing products is expensive, and we expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our product candidates in clinical trials and develop our commercial manufacturing capabilities. We are also entering into contracts with commercial manufacturers relating to the construction and operation of commercial manufacturing facilities. These contracts require substantial financial commitments from us if we choose to move forward with construction, with large payments due prior to any potential product revenue. We expect our expenses to increase substantially if and as we prepare for the commercial manufacturing and potential commercial launch of MYDICAR.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. As of December 31, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and investments were $84.9 million. Our research and development expenses were $22.7 million, $16.9 million and 13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In 2015, we plan to initiate additional clinical trials of MYDICAR for HFrEF. In addition, we may develop MYDICAR for additional indications including treatment of AVF maturation failure and for the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure who are on an LVAD. In addition, we are exploring the feasibility of using plasma exchange in removing AAV1 NAbs in advanced heart failure patients prior to administration of MYDICAR. Also, we may initiate a clinical trial in 2016 for the treatment of HFpEF, a condition caused by the inability of the heart to relax normally between contractions, if supported by the CUPID 2 results. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will enable us to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates and companion diagnostic, as well as to further develop MYDICAR for additional indications. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic goals that require additional capital.\nAny additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and any related companion diagnostics. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all, even if our clinical trials are successful. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than would otherwise be ideal and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or our companion diagnostic, or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any approved products or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRaising additional funds through debt or equity financing could be dilutive and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nTo the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of those securities could result in substantial dilution for our current stockholders and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders. Furthermore, the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings.\nIn order to raise required funds we may choose to enter into one or more collaborations. Such collaborations could require us to give up substantial rights to MYDICAR in the United States and/or outside the United States.\nWe may choose to enter into one or more collaborations to raise sufficient capital to continue the development of MYDICAR and our other product candidates and prepare for commercial-scale manufacturing and launch of MYDICAR. These collaborations could require us to relinquish substantial rights, potentially including the grant of an exclusive license to make use and sell MYDICAR, to another company.\nRisks Related to the Discovery and Development of our Product Candidates and Companion Diagnostic\nWe are highly dependent on the success of MYDICAR and we may not be able to successfully obtain regulatory or marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize, this product candidate.\nTo date, we have expended significant time, resources and effort on the development of MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. Although we are preparing for the development of MYDICAR for the treatment of HFpEF and AVF and preclinical activities relating to our small molecule product candidates and our stem cell factor gene therapy program, our ability to generate product revenues and to achieve commercial success will initially depend almost entirely on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and then successfully commercialize MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF in the United States and the European Economic Area, or EEA. Before we can market and sell MYDICAR in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, we will need to commence and complete additional clinical trials, manage clinical and manufacturing activities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA in the United States, from the EMA in the EEA, and from other foreign regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions for both MYDICAR and its companion diagnostic, obtain commercial manufacturing supply, build a commercial marketing organization or enter into a commercial marketing collaboration with a third party, and in some jurisdictions, obtain reimbursement authorization, among other things. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the necessary clinical trials and/or obtain regulatory approvals and sufficient commercial manufacturing supply for MYDICAR or its companion diagnostic. To date, no gene therapy product has ever been approved in the United States. If we do not receive regulatory approvals, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Even if we obtain regulatory approvals, we may never generate significant revenues from any commercial sales of MYDICAR. If we fail to successfully commercialize MYDICAR, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIn April 2015, we plan to un-blind the data from our ongoing CUPID 2 trial. If the results of the CUPID 2 trial are not positive, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. In addition, patients in the CUPID 2 trial are being followed for a total of five years in an extended long-term follow up period, which period will continue through February 2019. Even if the initial un-blinded results from the CUPID 2 trial are viewed positively, it is possible that negative consequences of the treatment could be observed in the future, which could adversely impact the regulatory and commercial prospects of MYDICAR. Any significant set-back regarding, or the failure of, MYDICAR will have a significant negative impact on our business.\nMYDICAR is based on a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval. At the moment, no gene therapy product has been approved in the United States and only one gene therapy product has been approved in Europe.\nWe have primarily concentrated our research and development efforts on our lead product candidate, MYDICAR, for the treatment of HFrEF, and our future success is highly dependent on the successful development of this product candidate. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our product candidates will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. In addition, our product development program is dependent on the development and commercialization of a required companion diagnostic by us or by third party collaborators. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation as medical devices and those diagnostic tools must independently be cleared or approved by the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities before we may commercialize our product candidates. We may also experience delays in finalizing our commercial manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners or producing clinical trial supplies, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.\nIn addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities, and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. For example, the FDA has required us to conduct a safety and efficacy trial of patients with pre-existing NAbs to the AAV-based vectors used by MYDICAR as well as a viral shedding trial to determine the dissemination of our MYDICAR vector particles into the environment. At the moment, no gene therapy product has been approved in the United States and only one gene therapy product, uniQure\u2019s Glybera, which received marketing authorization from the EMA in 2012, has been approved in Europe, which makes it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in either the United States or Europe. Prior product candidate approvals by the EMA may not be indicative of what the FDA or EMA may require for MYDICAR approval.\nRegulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. Gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, are also subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities\u2019 Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or the RAC. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC review process can impede the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial and approved its initiation. Conversely, the FDA can put an investigational new drug application, or IND, on clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a favorable review. Also, before a clinical trial can begin at an NIH-funded institution, that institution\u2019s institutional review board, or IRB, and its Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, will have to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities to change the requirements for approval of any of our gene therapy-based product candidates.\nThese regulatory review committees and advisory groups, and the new guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance the development of our gene therapy product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approvals necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain our business.\nFailure to successfully validate, commercialize and obtain regulatory approval for our companion diagnostic could delay or prevent commercialization of MYDICAR. Devices used in the administration of MYDICAR may also require labeling changes and result in delays for the commercialization of MYDICAR.\nA key element of our strategy is to screen out patients with certain amounts of pre-existing NAbs to the AAV1 viral vector used as an active ingredient in MYDICAR. We have developed a companion diagnostic that will be used to help us better identify those patients who may benefit from treatment with MYDICAR. Although we are currently exploring the feasibility of using a plasma exchange procedure to remove AAV1 NAbs from advanced heart failure patients to enable their treatment with MYDICAR, the FDA may not permit this procedure to be investigated in certain patient populations, and such a procedure may ultimately prove to be unsafe, ineffective or cost prohibitive, and we cannot predict with certainty when, if ever, such a procedure could successfully be implemented on a broad basis or whether such a procedure would be covered for reimbursement by third-party payors. We will be dependent on such companion diagnostic, both during our clinical trials and in connection with any future commercialization of MYDICAR for HFrEF or for other indications. We expect that we will enter into a strategic alliance with a third party for the automation and commercialization of our\ncompanion diagnostic. We and any of our future collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing the companion diagnostic for commercial application, including issues in relation to automation, selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, critical reagents, or clinical validation of such companion diagnostic. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA as medical devices and require separate regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization. In the case of MYDICAR, we anticipate that the FDA will require approval of the companion diagnostic under a medical device pre-market approval, or PMA, application prior to, or concurrently with, approval and commercialization of MYDICAR, which could delay our ability to commercialize both products. If we, or any of our future collaborators, fail to obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic or are delayed in receiving such approval, our ability to commercialize MYDICAR would be delayed until such time as regulatory approval is obtained. In addition, our future collaborators may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostic, and both they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostic in the clinical community. MYDICAR and certain of the off-the-shelf legally marketed administration components used in the cardiac catheterization laboratory may be regulated as combination products. These include, but are not limited to, regulated products where two or more separate products are packaged together (e.g., drug and device products); or a product packaged separately but intended for use only with an approved, individually specified product where both are required to achieve the intended use of the proposed product. We are in discussions with FDA regarding pre-commercial testing, packaging and labeling requirements for the administration devices and it is possible that MYDICAR may include labeling that specifies certain administration products or product attributes, and the labeling of some of the administration products may need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, which revisions could delay our ability to commercialize MYDICAR.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent development of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates as well as completion of required follow-up periods. If patients are unwilling to participate in our gene therapy trials because of negative publicity from adverse events in the biotechnology or gene therapy industries or for other reasons, including competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting trials and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed. In addition, if there are delays in accumulating the required number of clinical events in trials where clinical events are a primary endpoint, there may be delays in completing the trial. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether.\nPatient enrollment and completion of clinical trials are affected by factors including:\n\u2022\navailability of clinical supply of product;\n\u2022\nability to perform testing for AAV1 NAbs;\n\u2022\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\ndesign of the trial protocol;\n\u2022\nsize of the patient population;\n\u2022\neligibility criteria for the trial in question;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under trial;\n\u2022\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022\navailability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\npatient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nthe degree of treatment effect in event-driven trials.\nWe may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics or to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. We could experience difficulties enrolling the requisite number of patients for future clinical trials, including additional trials that may be required by the FDA for the approval of MYDICAR. For example, one significant obstacle to the timely recruitment and enrollment of a sufficient number of eligible patients in a Phase 3 trial of MYDICAR, if required, is the high prevalence of certain pre-existing NAbs to the viral vector used by MYDICAR, with, we believe, approximately 60% of potential patients in the United States exhibiting these antibodies. In other countries, such as Poland, the prevalence of pre-existing AAV1 NAbs is significantly higher. These antibodies neutralize the effectiveness of AAV-based vectors, such as MYDICAR, and although we are able to prescreen for the presence of these antibodies, the high prevalence of these antibodies in humans reduces the pool of available trial participants.\nWe plan to seek initial marketing approval for our product candidates in the United States and the EEA. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities. Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing or managing relationships with contract research organizations, or CROs, and physicians;\n\u2022\ndifferent standards for conducting clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners; and\n\u2022\nthe potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatments.\nIf we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials or we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n\u2022\ndelays in raising, or inability to raise, sufficient capital to fund the planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on trial design;\n\u2022\ndelays due to our inability to manufacture and deliver clinical supplies of drug product in a timely fashion;\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required IRB and IBC approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays due to changing standard of care for the diseases we are studying;\n\u2022\ndelays in dosing or other delays in our clinical trial plans or planned clinical trials as a result of direction from one or more independent data monitoring committees;\n\u2022\nadding new clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies, after an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites;\n\u2022\nfailure by our CROs, other third parties or us to adhere to clinical trial requirements;\n\u2022\ncatastrophic loss of product due to shipping delays or delays in customs in connection with delivery to foreign countries for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfailure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s good clinical practices, or GCPs, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\n\u2022\ndelays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of our product candidates to the clinical sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in the validation and automation of critical companion diagnostics;\n\u2022\ndelays in the manufacture of critical reagents used in any companion diagnostic;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical trial sites or patients dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\noccurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits; or\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols or supporting information.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. Even though we received Fast Track designation in December 2011 and Breakthrough Therapy designation in April 2014 from the FDA for MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF in NYHA Class III/IV heart failure patients, these designations may not result in faster review or approval, if at all. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf the results of our clinical trials are inconclusive or if there are safety concerns or adverse events associated with our product candidates, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates or critical companion diagnostics, if at all;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to changes in the way the product is administered;\n\u2022\nbe required to perform additional clinical trials to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u2022\nhave regulatory authorities withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;\n\u2022\nbe subject to the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u2022\nbe sued; or\n\u2022\nexperience damage to our reputation.\nOur product candidates could potentially cause other adverse events that have not yet been predicted. As described above, any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates and impair our ability to commercialize our products.\nSuccess in early clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained in later trials.\nTrial designs and results from previous trials, including the results from our CUPID 1 and ongoing CUPID 2 trial, are not necessarily predictive of our future clinical trial designs or results. In addition, our CUPID 1 and CUPID 2 trials had a combined enrollment of 301 patients, which we expect may not be a sufficiently high enough number to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or one or more other jurisdictions. Our product candidates may also fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in later stages of clinical development despite having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials.\nThere is a high failure rate for drugs and biological products proceeding through clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.\nThe results from our CUPID 2 trial may not be sufficiently robust to support the submission of marketing approval for MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF and additional trials may be required to support regulatory approval.\nOur ongoing CUPID 2 trial, which is a 250-patient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MYDICAR to reduce the frequency of, and/or delay of, heart failure-related hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF, may not be deemed to be a pivotal trial or may not provide sufficient support for a BLA or MAA submission. Although our CUPID 1 trial met its primary safety and efficacy endpoints at six months for high-dose MYDICAR versus placebo and the safety profile from this trial was very favorable, it is still possible that, even if we achieve favorable results in the CUPID 2 trial, the FDA may require us to conduct one or more additional clinical trials, possibly involving a larger sample size or a different clinical trial design, particularly if the FDA does not find the results from the CUPID 2 trial to be sufficiently persuasive to support a BLA submission. For example, the FDA advised us in October 2013 that the number of subjects in our proposed safety database may be an issue to be considered in review of our BLA submission. In addition, the FDA may not accept the use of the mITT analysis population for the CUPID 2 primary analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.\nIn November 2013, the EMA indicated that if MYDICAR demonstrates a substantial and highly significant treatment effect in the advanced heart failure population, and no untoward effects attributable to MYDICAR are observed, a safety database of approximately 205 to 230 MYDICAR-treated subjects may be sufficient to assess safety and allow acceptance of an MAA for MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF. However, the EMA has recently indicated that it is not satisfied that adequate control of type 1 error (false positive rate) by the joint\nfrailty model to be used for the primary efficacy analysis has been demonstrated, and as such, may not consider the results of our CUPID 2 trial to be sufficient for approval of MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF. If the FDA or the EMA requires additional studies, we will incur additional costs and delays in the marketing approval process. Even if additional studies are not required for regulatory approval, we will need to expend more resources than we currently have available in order to commercialize MYDICAR. In addition, it is possible that the FDA and the EMA may have divergent opinions on the elements necessary for a successful BLA and MAA, respectively, which may cause us to alter our development, regulatory and/or commercialization strategies.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\nAs with many pharmaceutical and biological products, treatment with MYDICAR may produce undesirable side effects or adverse reactions or events. Although extensive preclinical safety and biodistribution testing conducted on MYDICAR and other AAV vectors, including the CUPID 1 trial of MYDICAR for HFrEF and data from previous clinical trials of other AAV vectors, suggests that MYDICAR will be well tolerated, known adverse side effects that could present with treatment with AAV vectors include an immunologic reaction to the capsid protein or gene at early time points after administration. In previous clinical trials involving AAV viral vectors for gene therapy, some subjects experienced serious adverse events, including the development of a T-cell mediated immune response against the vector capsid proteins. As we make plans to initiate a phase 1/2 MYDICAR trial at a dose 2.5-fold higher than previously studied, a T-cell mediated immune response could become more of a risk. If our vectors demonstrate a similar effect, or other adverse events, we may be required to halt or delay further clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, theoretical adverse side effects of AAV vectors include replication and spread of the virus to other parts of the body and insertional oncogenesis, which is the process whereby the insertion of a gene near a gene that is important in cell growth or division results in uncontrolled cell division, which could potentially enhance the risk of malignant transformation or cancer. Potential procedure-related events are similar to those associated with standard coronary diagnostic procedures, and may include vascular injury (e.g., damage to the femoral, radial, or brachial arteries at the site of vascular access, or damage to the coronary arteries) or myocardial injury. If any such adverse events occur, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The product-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nEven if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, we cannot predict when, or if, we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate or the approval may be for a more narrow indication than we expect.\nWe cannot commercialize a product until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate and, if applicable, its companion diagnostic, as is the case with MYDICAR. Even if our product candidates demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA advisory committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a treatment candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. For example, the holder of an approved BLA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the BLA. The holder of an approved BLA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nIn addition, product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with good manufacturing practices, or GMP, and adherence to commitments made in the BLA. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of any of our product candidates, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nissue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve a pending BLA or supplements to a BLA submitted by us;\n\u2022\nseize product; or\n\u2022\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues.\nPublic opinion and heightened regulatory scrutiny of gene therapy and genetic research may impact public perception of our product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nGene therapy remains a novel technology, with no gene therapy product approved to date in the United States and only one gene therapy product approved to date in Europe. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians specializing in the treatment of those diseases that our product candidates target prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or, with respect to MYDICAR, in addition to, existing treatments they are already familiar with and for which greater clinical data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. For example, in conducting clinical trials of MYDICAR in Europe, we are subject to environmental assessment legislation applicable to genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, which classifies the administration of GMOs to humans\nas a \u201cdeliberate release\u201d of the GMO into the environment, thereby necessitating prior review and clearance by the applicable environmental assessment governing body. The level of scrutiny varies by country and some localities have additional requirements. Adverse events in our or others\u2019 gene therapy clinical trials, even if not ultimately attributable to the product candidates, and the resulting publicity could result in increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates.\nEven if we obtain and maintain approval for MYDICAR from one regulatory authority, we may never obtain approval for MYDICAR from regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, which would limit our market opportunities and adversely affect our business.\nApproval in the United States by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Sales of MYDICAR outside of the United States will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval. Even if the FDA grants marketing approval for a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must also approve the manufacturing and marketing of the product candidates in those countries and, if applicable, any required companion diagnostic. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. In many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products, if approved, is also subject to approval. While we may decide to submit an MAA to the EMA for approval in the EEA, obtaining such approval is a lengthy and expensive process and the EMA has its own procedures for approval of product candidates. Even if a product is approved, the FDA or the EMA, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the United States and the EEA also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those countries. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. Further, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not ensure approval in any other country, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Also, regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be withdrawn. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of MYDICAR will be harmed and our business will be adversely affected.\nIf approved, MYDICAR or any future products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to regulatory agencies and if we fail to do so, we could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nIf we are successful in commercializing MYDICAR or any other products, FDA and foreign regulatory agency regulations require that we report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nAlthough we have obtained an SPA for a potential Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF, this agreement does not guarantee any particular outcome from regulatory review.\nIn May 2012, we obtained an SPA from the FDA for a potential Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of MYDICAR. The FDA\u2019s SPA process creates a written agreement between the sponsoring company and the FDA regarding clinical trial design and other clinical trial issues, such as the trial endpoints, that can be used to support approval of a product candidate. The SPA is intended to provide assurance that if the agreed upon clinical trial protocols are followed and the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of an NDA or BLA. However, an SPA is not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate. In particular, an SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if previously unrecognized public health concerns arise during the performance of the clinical trial, if other new scientific concerns regarding product candidate safety or efficacy arise or if the sponsoring company fails to comply with the agreed upon clinical trial protocols. Moreover, an SPA does not address all of the variables and details that may go into planning for or conducting a clinical trial, and changes in the protocol for a clinical trial can invalidate an SPA or require that the FDA agree in writing to the modified protocol. In addition, while an SPA addresses the requirements for submission of a BLA, the results of the related clinical trial may not support FDA approval.\nCUPID 2 is similar in design to the SPA Phase 3 protocol and uses the same primary efficacy endpoint, except that CUPID 2 will use an mITT approach for the primary analysis population as opposed to an intent to treat approach and has a significantly smaller number of subjects. However, we believe that the FDA\u2019s agreement of the SPA regarding the trial endpoint is relevant to the CUPID 2 trial. Experience from the CUPID 2 trial has informed the design of a Phase 3 trial and we believe that significant changes to the protocol approved under the SPA are required, which would necessitate written agreement by FDA to ensure binding agreement of the protocol.\nRisks Related to our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct some or all aspects of our vector production, product manufacturing, combination product commercial supply, companion diagnostic testing, reagent manufacturing, protocol development, research, and preclinical and clinical testing, and these third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not currently, and do not expect to in the future, to independently conduct all aspects of our vector production, product manufacturing, combination product component supply, companion diagnostic testing, reagent manufacturing, protocol development, research and monitoring and management of our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties with respect to these items, and control only certain aspects of their activities.\nMost of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, our product candidate or companion diagnostic development activities may be delayed. Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities, including the conduct of any IND-enabling studies, reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required legal, regulatory and scientific standards and any applicable trial protocols. For example, for product candidates that we develop and commercialize on our own, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our IND-enabling studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the trial plan and protocols.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated study plans and protocols, we may be delayed in completing, or unable to complete, the preclinical studies and clinical trials required to support future IND submissions and approval of our product candidates.\nWe rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates and our companion diagnostic for our clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture our product candidates and our companion diagnostic. Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate, a diagnostic reagent, or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates or companion diagnostic. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates or companion diagnostic, our ability to commercially launch and/or generate revenues from the sale of any of our approved products or companion diagnostic would be impaired. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails exposure to risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product candidates or companion diagnostic ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nreduced control over the manufacturing process for our product candidates and companion diagnostic as a result of using third-party manufacturers for all aspects of manufacturing activities;\n\u2022\ntermination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that may be costly or damaging to us or result in delays in the development or commercialization of our product candidates or companion diagnostic; and\n\u2022\ndisruptions to the operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers caused by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier.\nAny of these events could lead to delays in the development of our product candidates or companion diagnostic, including delays in our clinical trials, or failure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or companion diagnostic, or it could impact our ability to successfully commercialize our current product candidates, companion diagnostic or any future products. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA or other regulatory action, including injunction, recall, seizure or total or partial suspension of production.\nWe and our contract manufacturers are subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing our viral vectors, product candidates and companion diagnostic. The manufacturing facilities on which we rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements and have limited capacity.\nWe currently have a relationship with only two suppliers, Lonza and Novasep, for the manufacturing of our viral vectors and product candidates for clinical testing purposes. We expect to rely upon Lonza, Novasep, and/or other third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our product candidates and companion diagnostic if we succeed in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. Because certain of our license agreements place restrictions on our ability to transfer or sublicense our intellectual property rights obtained under such agreements in connection with manufacturing activities, if any supplier we use requires a sublicense of our intellectual property rights for commercial manufacture of our viral vectors, product candidates or companion diagnostic, we may be unable to transfer or sublicense the requisite intellectual property rights, which may negatively impact our supply of our viral vectors, product candidates or companion diagnostic.\nAll entities involved in the preparation of therapeutic product for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our existing contract manufacturers, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with GMP and equivalent foreign standards. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and\nassure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. We or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of a BLA on a timely basis and must adhere to GMP regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with GMP or failure to scale-up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates or companion diagnostic. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party contractors must also pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our product candidates or companion diagnostic. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our product candidates, companion diagnostic or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If these facilities and quality systems do not pass a pre-approval plant inspection, FDA approval of our product candidates, or the equivalent approvals in other jurisdictions, will not be granted.\nRegulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nIf we or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug product or biological product, or revocation of a pre-existing approval. If any such event occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nAdditionally, if supply from one approved manufacturer is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. An alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a BLA supplement which could result in further delay. The regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. Switching or adding manufacturers may involve substantial costs and would likely result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines.\nThese factors could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our products successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to meet contractual requirements, and if we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure our clinical trials are conducted properly and on time. While we will have agreements governing their activities, we will have limited influence over their actual performance. We will control only certain aspects of our CROs\u2019 activities. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWe and our principal investigators and CROs are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s and the ICH\u2019s (the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use) GCPs for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. The FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we, our principal investigators or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the EMA, or other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications. Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical trials did not comply with GCPs. In addition, our future clinical trials will require a sufficient number of patients to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat such clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and we are therefore unable to directly monitor whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other product development activities that could harm our competitive position. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates. If any such event were to occur, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Further, switching or adding additional CROs involves additional costs and requires management time and focus. We have recently entered into a contract with a new CRO for new clinical trials. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute our vectors and products for the clinical trials that we conduct. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe may seek to form strategic alliances in the future with respect to our product candidates or companion diagnostic, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances.\nWe may form strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates and companion diagnostic. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Any delays in entering into new strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates or companion diagnostic could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other collaborative arrangement for any future product candidates or companion diagnostic because the potential partner may consider that our research and development pipeline is insufficiently developed to justify a collaborative effort, or that our product candidates\nand programs do not have the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the target population. Even if we are successful in establishing such a strategic partnership or collaboration, we cannot be certain that, following such a strategic transaction or license, we will be able to progress the development and commercialization of the applicable product candidates as envisaged, or that we will achieve the revenues that would justify such transaction.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of our Product Candidates and Companion Diagnostic\nWe intend to rely on third parties to produce our viral vectors, product candidates and other key materials and for our companion diagnostic testing, but these manufacturers have minimal or no experience producing our vectors, product candidates or companion diagnostic materials at commercial levels and may not achieve the necessary regulatory approvals or produce our vectors, products or companion diagnostic materials at the quality, quantities, locations and timing needed to support commercialization.\nWe are currently developing a scalable manufacturing process for MYDICAR, which we have transferred to Lonza and are in the process of transferring to Novasep. We have completed a first demonstration batch at commercial scale of production (2,000-liter production bioreactor scale) at Lonza in Houston, TX, and are in the process of testing this material for conformance to our specifications. Although we have entered into an agreement for the manufacture of our MYDICAR drug substance with Lonza for our clinical trials, Lonza may not perform as agreed, may be unable to comply with GMP requirements and with FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements or may terminate its agreement with us. If Lonza is unable to manufacture MYDICAR drug substance in a timely manner, encounters manufacturing difficulties, or otherwise fails to comply with its contractual obligations and we are required to switch to a new manufacturer, we expect that our clinical development timeline would be delayed by at least one year. Because of the complex nature of our product candidates, Lonza, Novasep, or any other manufacturer with whom we may enter into an agreement, may not be able to manufacture our product candidates at a cost or in quantities or on timelines necessary for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. If we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, we will be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities, relying on one or more third parties, and there is no guarantee that any such third parties will be able to do this in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, in the event that our product development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical trial and commercial manufacturing capacity. We have minimal experience manufacturing pharmaceutical or biological products on a commercial scale and our potential suppliers, including Lonza and Novasep, will have to construct and validate new commercial manufacturing facilities and obtain regulatory approvals for the facilities before being able to produce MYDICAR, and there can be no assurance that they will succeed in doing so.\nEven if we develop a commercial scale manufacturing process in a timely fashion and successfully transfer it to Lonza, Novasep, or any other third-party vector and product manufacturers, if such third-party manufacturers are unable to produce our viral vectors or product candidates in the necessary quantities, or in compliance with GMP, or in compliance with pertinent regulatory requirements, and within our planned time frame and cost parameters, the development and sales of our products, if approved, may be materially harmed.\nWe similarly intend to enter into agreements with third parties for the automation, characterization and validation, of our companion diagnostic and the manufacture of its critical reagents. However, we may be unable to enter into such an agreement on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe may run into technical or scientific issues related to manufacturing or development that we may be unable to resolve in a timely manner or with available funds. In addition, we have not completed the development, characterization and validation activities necessary for commercial and regulatory approvals. If Lonza, Novasep, or any of our other manufacturing partners does not obtain such regulatory approvals for their facilities, our commercialization efforts will be harmed. In addition, any significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business. We source key materials from third parties, either directly through agreements with suppliers or indirectly through our manufacturers who have agreements with suppliers. There\nare a small number of suppliers for certain key materials that are used to manufacture our product candidates and companion diagnostic. Such suppliers may not sell these key materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these key materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these key materials.\nOur decision as to whether to exercise the construction trigger under our facility construction and commercial supply agreement with Lonza and/or proceed with the next phase of our agreement with Novasep will depend on a number of factors. If we are unable to or determine not to exercise our rights under either or both agreements, the manufacturer will not proceed with the construction of or validation of their proposed facility and we will need to identify, negotiate terms for and secure alternate sources of commercial supply of MYDICAR in order to commercialize MYDICAR. We may need to decide whether to exercise one or both of these triggers based on incomplete information regarding the potential approvability of MYDICAR or the potential timelines for commercial launch, and each of these triggers entails a very substantial financial commitment by us.\nIn October 2014, we entered into a Facility Construction and Commercial Supply Agreement with Lonza Biologics, Inc., or Lonza, pursuant to which we and Lonza agreed to initiate detailed design planning for the potential construction of a new commercial viral therapeutics facility in Portsmouth, New Hampshire for the manufacture of MYDICAR drug substance (AAV1/SERCA2a), and in exchange for an upfront reservation fee payable by us to Lonza, Lonza agreed to reserve, for a period of time extendable on payment of specified reservation extension fees, the capital, property and labor resources necessary to enable the initiation of construction of the facility within 75 days of receipt of notice of our decision to initiate construction of the facility and commit to a long-term supply arrangement for MYDICAR, or the construction trigger. The construction trigger may not be exercised by us prior to completion of an agreed upon detailed design for the facility, which we currently expect may be completed during the third quarter of 2015, but there can be no assurance that it will be completed on this timeframe, or at all. Our decision as to whether to exercise the construction trigger may be impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, the outcome of our CUPID 2 trial of MYDICAR, our expectations regarding clinical trial requirements and development timelines, and our perception of the prospects for commercialization of MYDICAR. Even if we view the results of our CUPID 2 trial as sufficiently favorable to support a decision to exercise the construction trigger, our ability to do so may be limited by a number of additional factors, including our ability to obtain financing on terms sufficient to fund our financial obligations under the agreement following exercise of the construction trigger. In addition, under our loan and security agreement with Hercules, we will be required to either obtain the consent of Hercules prior to exercising the construction trigger or pay off our outstanding loan under the agreement, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to do either within the timeframe available to us to exercise the construction trigger.\nIn March 2015 we entered into a Development, Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Novasep pursuant to which we agreed to continue process transfer activities to enable Novasep to complete manufacturing scale-up and validation of a facility in Europe. We have the right to terminate this agreement, exercisable for a specified period of time following the un-blinding of the CUPID 2 data, if we conclude in good faith that the CUPID 2 data is such that we do not require production of MYDICAR drug substance at the Novasep Facility. We will need to decide whether to terminate the agreement or proceed with very substantial commitments to pay for the design, construction activities and operation of the manufacturing facility, including the purchase of commercial lots of MYDICAR on a \u201ctake or pay\u201d basis, which means that we must commit to a minimum amount of purchases of MYDICAR through the end of 2018 or (or 2019 if we choose to have the facility be dedicated solely to MYDICAR drug substance manufacture) or make significant payments to Novasep. This decision has material consequences for the rate of our expenditures going forward, and will need to be made based upon incomplete information regarding the probability of regulatory approval of MYDICAR and the timeline for potential commercial launch assuming regulatory approval is obtained.\nEven if we proceed with one or both of the Lonza or Novasep agreements, we may not realize the anticipated benefits under the agreements and may incur considerable losses and commercialization delays associated with the construction or validation of the facilities. There can be no assurance that the construction or validation of the facilities will be completed within the budget we anticipate or in a timely manner, or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In connection with our continuation of the Lonza and/or Novasep agreements, we will be required to commit to one or more long-term supply arrangements that will involve minimum purchase obligations.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates or companion diagnostic, if approved, we may be unable to generate any revenues.\nWe currently do not have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products that may be approved, including MYDICAR, we must build our sales, distribution, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We have no prior experience in the marketing, sale or distribution of pharmaceutical or diagnostic products and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain, and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of these products. We will likely seek to enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to commercialize our product candidates and companion diagnostic outside of the United States. We intend to build an internal sales and marketing organization for the commercialization of MYDICAR in the United States. However, we will also consider the option to enter into strategic partnerships for our product candidates and companion diagnostic in the United States and other geographies where we obtain marketing approval. We may need to give up substantial rights to MYDICAR in the United States and outside the United States in order to finance the continued development, manufacturing and commercial launch of MYDICAR.\nOur strategy for MYDICAR is to develop a hospital-directed specialty sales force and/or collaborate with third parties to promote the product to selected cardiologists, heart failure specialists, other health care providers and third-party payors in the United States. Some pharmaceutical companies employ groups of sales representatives of much larger scale than we intend to utilize to target their cardiovascular products for the general physician community and third-party payors. We will likely seek to align ourselves with collaborators as part of our commercialization strategy, particularly outside of the United States, and our future collaboration partners, if any, may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or companion diagnostic or may otherwise fail in their commercialization due to factors beyond our control. If we are unable to establish effective collaborations to enable the sale of our product candidates and companion diagnostic to healthcare professionals and in geographical regions, including the United States, that will not be covered by our own marketing and sales force, or if our potential future collaboration partners do not successfully commercialize our product candidates or companion diagnostic, our ability to generate revenues from product sales, including sales of MYDICAR, will be adversely affected.\nBuilding an internal sales force involves many challenges, including:\n\u2022\nrecruiting and retaining talented people;\n\u2022\ntraining employees who we recruit;\n\u2022\nsetting the appropriate system of incentives;\n\u2022\nmanaging additional headcount; and\n\u2022\nintegrating a new business unit into an existing corporate architecture.\nIf we are unable to build our own sales force or negotiate a strategic partnership for the commercialization of MYDICAR or our companion diagnostic in the United States, we may be forced to delay the potential commercialization of MYDICAR, reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities for MYDICAR or undertake the commercialization activities for MYDICAR at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund commercialization activities ourselves, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring MYDICAR to market or generate product revenue. We could enter into arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be ideal and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or our companion diagnostic or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not become profitable. We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nIn addition, there are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nIf the market size for MYDICAR is considerably smaller than we anticipate, it could significantly and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is very difficult to estimate the future commercial potential of MYDICAR due to factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, changing standards of care, achieving favorable hospital formulary status, third-party payor reimbursement standards, ability of patients to meet co-payment amounts, patient and physician preferences, and the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge. We believe that approximately 60% of such potential patients in the United States will be ineligible for treatment with MYDICAR due to the presence of pre-existing AAV1 NAbs which will neutralize the effectiveness of AAV-based vectors such as MYDICAR. In other countries, such as Poland, the prevalence of pre-existing AAV-resistant antibodies is significantly higher. In addition, just one exposure to an AAV-based treatment such as MYDICAR may cause a patient to produce NAbs. Furthermore, other pharmaceutical companies could develop and receive approval for new AAV-based treatments which could increase the number of patients that exhibit NAbs. We estimate that there are over 350,000 heart failure patients in the United States alone that would be eligible for MYDICAR treatment upon launch, if approved; however, if the potential eligible patient population is lower than we anticipate, or if considerably more than 60% of potential patients exhibit NAbs, it could significantly and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition and rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe face competition both in the United States and internationally, including from major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Some of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we know are developing gene therapies for heart failure that could potentially be competitive with or hinder the uptake of MYDICAR and change the standard of care for\nheart failure patients include Renova Therapeutics, NanoCor Therapeutics, Juventas Therapeutics, VentriNova, uniQure N.V. and Beat BioTherapeutics. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in our target disease areas.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop, or achieve earlier patent protection, regulatory approval, product commercialization and market penetration than we do. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors.\nUnder the terms of our license agreement with AskBio LLC, or AskBio, we granted AskBio an option to obtain a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain of our patent rights related to infusion of AAV in the arteries of the heart to develop, manufacture, use and sell products for the treatment of cardiac diseases. This option includes our currently pending patent application related to a method of treating a cardiovascular disease by infusion of a therapeutic nucleic acid into the coronary circulation over a specified period of time. It does not include our issued patent in this family, which includes claims to the concurrent use of a vasodilating substance such as nitroglycerin. Although the scope of the license granted to AskBio excludes our issued patent and the scope of our anticipated regulatory approvals, there can be no guarantee AskBio will not seek to develop and commercialize a product that is able to compete with MYDICAR.\nEven if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate faster than our competitors, we may face competition from \u201cbiosimilars\u201d due to the changing regulatory environment. In the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be \u201chighly similar,\u201d or \u201cbiosimilar,\u201d to or \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with an FDA-approved biological product. This new pathway could allow competitors to reference data from biological products already approved after 12 years from the time of approval in the United States. In addition, companies may be developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with our products. If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our products, our products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of our applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired.\nFinally, as a result of the expiration or successful challenge of our patent rights, we could face litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our competitors\u2019 products. The availability of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any products that we may develop and commercialize.\nThe commercial success of any current or future gene therapy product candidate will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and other health care providers in the medical community.\nEthical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the products and processes we may use. Even with the requisite approvals, the commercial success of our gene therapy product candidates will depend in part on the medical community, patients, and third-party payors accepting gene therapy products in general, and our product candidates in particular, as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe. Any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and other health care providers in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant\nproduct revenue and may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of these product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe potential efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nwith respect to MYDICAR, the approval, availability and market acceptance, coverage and reimbursement for the companion diagnostic;\n\u2022\nability of patients to pay co-payment amounts, if applicable;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of such product candidate over alternative treatments, especially with respect to patient subsets that we are targeting with such product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe existence of other gene therapy products utilizing an AAV vector, which potential patients may elect to take for other indications, thereby causing them to develop NAbs and making them ineligible to take MYDICAR;\n\u2022\nthe safety of such product candidate seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\npublicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u2022\nsufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of the product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by the conventional technologies marketed by our competitors.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for MYDICAR, our companion diagnostic or any other product candidates, if approved, on reasonable pricing terms, their commercial success may be severely hindered.\nSuccessful sales of any approved product candidates depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed\ncare, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. Co-pay amounts under Medicare (generally 20% of the cost of the treatment for patients without supplemental insurance) or other third-party payor systems may be a substantial hindrance to certain patients\u2019 ability to pay for MYDICAR treatment. In addition, the market for MYDICAR and any of our other product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors\u2019 formularies, or lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement and patients\u2019 ability to make copayments, if applicable.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be obtained. In many foreign countries, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country, and we may fail to obtain such reimbursement approvals.\nIn the United States, decisions about Medicare coverage and reimbursement for new medicines are made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services responsible for administering the Medicare program. Private payors and other government payors often follow CMS\u2019s policies to a substantial degree, making the Medicare determinations particularly significant. It remains uncertain what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Similarly, outside the United States, we may not succeed in obtaining reimbursement approval from the relevant regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new products when more established or lower cost alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required CMS to reduce the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, by 2% in 2013, which in turn serves as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. In addition, CMS announced that it will bundle the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting beginning on January 1, 2014.\nMore recently, on April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, was signed to law, which, among other things, significantly alters the current payment methodology under the CLFS. Under the new law, starting January 1, 2016 and every three years thereafter (or annually in the case of advanced diagnostic lab tests), applicable clinical laboratories must report laboratory test payment data for each Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic lab test that it furnishes during a time period to be defined by future regulations. The reported data must include the payment rate (reflecting all discounts, rebates, coupons and other price concessions) and the volume of each test that was paid by each private payor (including health insurance issuers, group health plans, Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid managed care organizations). Beginning in 2017, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test will be equal to the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period. The payment rate will apply to clinical laboratory diagnostic tests furnished by a hospital laboratory if the test is separately paid under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system. Additionally, PAMA overrules reforms included in the 2014 final rule for the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule that called for a process to permit CMS to adjust payments under the CLFS to account for technological changes in tools, machines, supplies, labor, instruments, skills, techniques and devices by which laboratory tests are produced and used beginning in 2015. Levels of reimbursement may be impacted by these initiatives and other current and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors in a manner that\nmay harm the demand and reimbursement available for our products, including our companion diagnostic, which in turn, could harm our product pricing and sales.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits.\nThird-party coverage and reimbursement for MYDICAR or any of our other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets and may vary substantially from our current assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nHealthcare reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, was passed, which has the potential to substantially change health care financing by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government\u2019s comparative effectiveness research.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, including physicians, hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we may enter into agreements with third parties to market them on a worldwide basis or in more limited geographical regions. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for approval of drugs and biological products in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nregulations under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the members of our executive team, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. While we have entered into offer letters with each of our executive officers, any of them could leave our employment at any time, as all of our employees are \u201cat will\u201d employees. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees, consultants and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success.\nAlthough we have not historically experienced unique difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees, we could experience such problems in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our clinical development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms, or at all, given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in preclinical studies or clinical trials may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive, key employee, consultant or advisor may impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives. Furthermore, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output.\nIf CUPID 2 data are positive, we will need to expand our organization substantially in a short period of time and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of March 15, 2015, we had 34 full-time employees. As we mature and expand our research and development, commercial manufacturing, quality control and quality assurance and other pre-commercialization activities, we expect to expand our full-time employee base and to hire more consultants and contractors. In addition, we currently plan to commercialize MYDICAR, if approved, using an internal sales force to target selected cardiologists, heart failure specialists and third-party payors in the United States. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct that fails to: comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, promotion, sales, marketing and certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our prescribers, customers and purchasers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Health Care Program Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal civil and criminal False Claims Acts. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed promotional, sales, marketing and educational programs. In\naddition, we may be subject to patient privacy laws by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Care Program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind in return for, the purchase, recommendation, leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or from making false or fraudulent statements to defraud any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private);\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, and as amended again by the final HIPAA omnibus rule, Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Enforcement, and Breach Notification Rules Under HITECH and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act; Other Modifications to HIPAA, published in January 2013, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, health care clearinghouses and health care providers;\n\u2022\nthe federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs and devices;\n\u2022\nfederal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act that requires certain drug manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nthe Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, which may impact, among other things, reimbursement rates by federal health care programs and commercial insurers; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts in certain circumstances, such as specific disease states.\nFurther, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal statute governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity can now be found guilty of violating the Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal criminal healthcare fraud statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nWe face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use or misuse of our product candidates harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our product candidates, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.\nThe use or misuse of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. There is a risk that our product candidates may induce adverse events. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts due to related litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; and\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.\nWe carry product liability insurance of $10.0 million per occurrence and a $10.0 million aggregate limit. We believe our product liability insurance coverage is appropriate in light of our current clinical programs; however, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If and when we obtain marketing approval for product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nPatients with the diseases targeted by our product candidates are often already in severe and advanced stages of disease and have both known and unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening health risks. During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our products, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval process in other countries, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates.\nThe success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to identify, develop and commercialize products based on our gene therapy, stem cell factor and small molecule platforms. Our research programs may fail to identify other potential product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons. For example, our research methodology may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates or our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nWe may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited resources, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or product candidates or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or\ntarget market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. The recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the recent global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our product candidates and a decreased ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. This is particularly true in Europe, which is undergoing a continued severe economic crisis. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future CROs and other contractors, consultants and potential collaborators are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture our vectors, our product candidates and our companion diagnostic and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates and any related companion diagnostics could be delayed.\nInterruptions in the supply of product or inventory loss may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur product candidates and companion diagnostic are manufactured and distributed using technically complex processes requiring specialized facilities, highly specific raw materials and other production constraints. The complexity of these processes, as well as strict company and government standards for the manufacture and storage of our products, subjects us to production risks. While product batches released for use in clinical trials or for commercialization undergo sample testing, some defects may only be identified following product release. In addition, process deviations or unanticipated effects of approved process changes may result in these intermediate products not complying with stability requirements or specifications. Most of our product candidates must be stored and transported at temperatures within a certain range. If these environmental conditions deviate, our product candidates\u2019 remaining shelf-lives could be impaired or their efficacy and safety could become adversely affected, making them no longer suitable for use. The occurrence or suspected occurrence of production and distribution difficulties can lead to lost inventories, and in some cases product recalls, with consequential reputational damage and the risk of product liability. The investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause production delays, substantial expense, lost sales and delays of new product launches. Any interruption in the supply of finished products or the loss thereof could hinder our\nability to timely distribute our products and satisfy customer demand. Any unforeseen failure in the storage of the product or loss in supply could delay our clinical trials and, if our product candidates are approved, result in a loss of our market share and negatively affect our revenues and operations.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nEarthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. A majority of our management operates in our principal executive offices located in San Diego, California. If our San Diego offices were affected by a natural or man-made disaster, particularly those that are characteristic of the region, such as wildfires and earthquakes, or other business interruption, our ability to manage our domestic and foreign operations could be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We currently rely, and intend to rely in the future, on our third-party manufacturer, Lonza, to produce our clinical supply of MYDICAR. Our ability to obtain supply of MYDICAR could be disrupted, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if the operations of Lonza were affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. The ultimate impact of any such events on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure is unknown. For more information regarding our manufacturing services agreement with Lonza, see \u201cBusiness-Manufacturing-Manufacturing Services Agreement with Lonza\u201d in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates and companion diagnostic, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our product candidates and companion diagnostic. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates and companion diagnostic in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our product candidates or companion diagnostic, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates or companion diagnostic or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our programs, product candidates and companion diagnostic fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidates or companion diagnostic, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop product candidates, and threaten our ability to commercialize, future products.\nSeveral patent applications covering our product candidates and companion diagnostic have been filed recently. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patent or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates or companion diagnostic that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate and companion diagnostic under patent protection could be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to a product candidate or companion diagnostic. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference proceeding in the United States can be initiated by a third party to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates and companion diagnostic are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our product candidates and companion diagnostic discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nAlthough we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, is currently considering whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA\u2019s disclosure policies may change in the future, if at all. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements under which we are granted rights to intellectual property that are important to our business and we expect that we may need to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose on us, various development, regulatory and/or commercial diligence obligations, payment of milestones and/or royalties and other obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license. Additionally, several of our existing license agreements are sublicenses from a third party who is not the original licensor of the intellectual property at issue. Under these agreements, we must rely on our licensor to comply with their obligations under the primary license agreements under which such third party obtained rights in the applicable intellectual property, where we may have no relationship with the original licensor of such rights. If our licensors fail to comply with their obligations under these upstream license agreements, the original third-party licensor may have the right to terminate the original license, which may terminate our sublicense. If this were to occur, we would no longer have rights to the applicable intellectual property unless we are able to secure our own direct license with the owner of the relevant rights, which we may not be able to do at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, which may impact our ability to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates and companion diagnostic incorporating the relevant intellectual property. See \u201cBusiness-License Agreements\u201d in this Annual Report for a description of our license agreements, which includes a description of the termination provisions of these agreements.\nAs we have done previously, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates or companion diagnostic, and we cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our current product candidates or companion diagnostic or future products in the absence of such a license. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates or companion diagnostic, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation.\nLicensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. Disputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nwhether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nour right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product candidates or the companion diagnostic, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; and\n\u2022\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates or any related companion diagnostics.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter partes review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates and our companion diagnostic. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates and companion diagnostic may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates and companion diagnostic. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or companion diagnostic may infringe, or which such third parties claim are infringed by the use of our technologies. If any third-party patents are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover any aspect of the manufacturing process for any of our product candidates or companion diagnostic, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process, or any final product candidate or companion diagnostic, including the formulation or method of use of such product candidate or companion diagnostic, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate or companion diagnostic unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. In any such case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nParties making claims against us for infringement of their intellectual property rights may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates or any related companion diagnostics. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we could be required to redesign our infringing products or obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and commercializing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. It may be impossible to redesign our products and technology, or it may require substantial time and monetary expenditure, which could force us to cease commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or the companion diagnostic, or some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. In addition, in any such proceeding, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees in the event we are found liable for willful infringement.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to product components and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nPresently we have rights to the intellectual property, through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own, to develop our product candidates and companion diagnostic. Because our programs may involve additional product candidates or companion diagnostics that may require the use of proprietary rights held by\nthird parties, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. In addition, our product candidates and companion diagnostic may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and companies, which may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates and companion diagnostic. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nFor example, we collaborate with U.S. and foreign academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such right of first negotiation for intellectual property, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified time frame or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us, either on reasonable terms, or at all. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment, or at all. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights, our ability to commercialize our products, and our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid, is unenforceable and/or is not infringed, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. A third-party defendant may also request post grant review or inter partes review by the U.S. PTO of any patent we assert. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our product candidates and companion diagnostic may be dependent on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek to obtain the right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the patents relating to our product candidates and companion diagnostic, there may be times when the filing and prosecution activities for platform technology patents that relate to our product candidates and companion diagnostic are controlled by our licensors. For example, we do not have the right to prosecute and maintain the patent rights licensed to us under agreements with each of The Regents of the University of California, AmpliPhi (including the patent rights sublicensed to us from UPenn), Virovek Incorporation, AskBio and Dr. Martin J. Kaplitt, and our ability to have input into such filing and prosecution activities is limited. If these licensors or any of our future licensors fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for patents covering any of our product candidates or companion diagnostic, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates and companion diagnostic may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties to manufacture our vectors, product candidates and companion diagnostic, and because we collaborate with various organizations and academic institutions on the advancement of our gene therapy and small molecule platforms and companion diagnostic, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with in the future will usually expect to be granted rights to publish data arising out of such collaboration, provided that we are notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure patent protection of intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future we may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development partnerships or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of information by any of our third-party collaborators. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nIn September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The U.S. PTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of\nthe substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, were enacted in March 2013. It is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. Moreover, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAlthough we seek to protect our ownership of intellectual property rights by ensuring that our agreements with our employees, collaborators and other third parties with whom we do business include provisions requiring such parties to assign rights in inventions to us, we may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates and companion diagnostic. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates and companion diagnostic. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the U.S. PTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The U.S. PTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIssued patents covering our product candidates and companion diagnostic could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or the U.S. PTO.\nIf we or one of our licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates or companion diagnostic, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate or companion diagnostic, as applicable, is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous ground upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates or related companion diagnostics. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates and companion diagnostic. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the recent case, Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules are not patentable. While we do not believe that any of the patents owned or licensed by us will be found invalid based on this decision, we cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the U.S. PTO may impact the value of our patents.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do\nnot favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make gene therapies or small molecule compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022\nissued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell some or all of your shares at a desired market price.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u2022\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nreports of adverse events in other gene therapy products or clinical trials of such products;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain additional funding;\n\u2022\nany delay in filing an IND or BLA for any of our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA\u2019s review of that IND or BLA;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain regulatory and marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nsales or potential sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully develop, manufacturers, and commercialize our product candidates or companion diagnostic;\n\u2022\nfailure to enter into collaborations;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our licensors to prosecute, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nour dependence on third parties, including, commercial manufactures, CROs as well as our partners that provide us with our companion diagnostic product;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to future products;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain adequate clinical and commercial product supply for our product candidates or companion diagnostic or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial projections we may provide to the public;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed the financial projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies; and\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, companies trading in the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Market in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, 5% stockholders and their affiliates currently beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding voting stock. Therefore, these stockholders have the ability and may continue to have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine some or all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our product candidates, companion diagnostic or future development programs;\n\u2022\nif any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, the level of underlying demand for these product candidates and wholesalers\u2019 buying patterns;\n\u2022\naddition or termination of clinical trials or funding support;\n\u2022\nour execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements.\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved; and\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting our product candidates or companion diagnostic or those of our competitors.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nCertain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nPursuant to our 2013 equity incentive plan, or the 2013 plan, our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants. The number of shares available for future grant under the 2013 plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each year by 5% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. In addition, we may grant or provide for the grant of rights to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our 2013 employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year by the lesser of 1% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year and 384,307 shares, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. Currently, we plan to register the increased number of shares available for issuance under the 2013 plan and ESPP each year. Increases in the number of shares available for future grant or purchase may result in additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future grant inducement grants to prospective employees and consultants, which may result in further dilution and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are at risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have determined that several ownership changes have occurred since our inception and have reduced our deferred tax asset accordingly. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition our ability to pay dividends is currently restricted by the terms of our loan agreement with Hercules. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u2022\ncreating a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us.\nOur employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other employees may require us to pay severance benefits to any of those persons who are terminated under specified circumstances, including in connection with a change of control of us, which could harm our financial condition or results.\nOur executive officers and certain other employees are parties to employment agreements that contain change of control and severance provisions providing for severance and other benefits and acceleration of vesting of stock options in the event of a termination of employment under specified circumstances, including in connection with a change of control of us. The accelerated vesting of options could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and harm the market price of our common stock. The payment of these severance benefits could harm our financial condition and results. In addition, these potential severance payments may discourage or prevent third parties from seeking a business combination with us.", "PERMNO": 14423, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EIGR"}
