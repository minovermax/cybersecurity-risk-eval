{"cik": "1064728", "company": "PEABODY ENERGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks. The following discussion highlights some of these risks and others are discussed elsewhere in this report. These and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, operating results or cash flows. The following risk factors are not an exhaustive list of the risks associated with our business. New factors may emerge or changes to these risks could occur that could materially affect our business.\nRisks Associated with Our Operations\nAs a result of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations and our election to exercise a 30-day grace period with respect to certain interest payments, together with other factors, including the possibility that a covenant default or other event of default could cause certain of our indebtedness to become immediately due and payable (after the expiration of any applicable grace period), we may not have sufficient liquidity to sustain operations and to continue as a going concern.\nWe incurred a substantial loss from operations and had negative cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our current operating plan indicates that we will continue to incur losses from operations and generate negative cash flows from operating activities. These projections and certain liquidity risks raise substantial doubt about whether we will meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date of issuance of this report. We have also elected to exercise the 30-day grace period with respect to a $21.1 million semi-annual interest payment due March 15, 2016 on the 6.50% Senior Notes due September 2020 and a $50.0 million semi-annual interest payment due March 15, 2016 on the 10.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due March 2022, as provided for in the indentures governing these notes. Failure to pay these interest amounts on March 15, 2016 is not immediately an event of default under the indentures governing these notes, but would become an event of default if the payment is not made within 30 days of such date. As a result of these factors, as well as the continued uncertainty around global coal fundamentals, the stagnated economic growth of certain major coal-importing nations, and the potential for significant additional regulatory requirements imposed on coal producers, among others, there exists substantial doubt whether we will be able to continue as a going concern. In addition, in February 2016, we borrowed approximately $945 million under the 2013 Revolver, the maximum amount available, for general corporate purposes.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern, other than the reclassification of certain long-term debt and the related debt issuance costs to current liabilities and current assets, respectively. The report from our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes an uncertainty paragraph that summarizes the salient facts and conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur 2013 Credit Facility and its related governing documents contain requirements (as more fully described under \"Risks Associated with Our Indebtedness\" below) that, among other things, require us to comply with certain financial covenants and furnish our audited financial statements as soon as available, but in any event within 90 days after the fiscal year end without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d uncertainty paragraph in the auditor\u2019s opinion. Our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included herein contain a \"going concern\" uncertainty paragraph. In addition, we currently anticipate that our reported Adjusted EBITDA and other sources of earnings or adjustments used to calculate Consolidated EBITDA (if such other sources of earnings or adjustments do not include the proceeds of certain targeted asset sales) will fall below our Consolidated Net Cash Interest Charges during 2016, and we anticipate we will not comply with our financial covenants as of March 31, 2016. Absent waivers or cures, non-compliance with such covenants would constitute a default under the 2013 Credit Facility. As a result, all indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility could be declared immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of an event of default (after the expiration of any applicable grace period). It is possible we could obtain waivers from our lenders; however, the aforementioned projections and certain liquidity risks raise substantial doubt about whether we will meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date of issuance of this report.\nWe are currently exploring alternatives for other sources of capital for ongoing liquidity needs and transactions to enhance our ability to comply with the financial covenants under our 2013 Credit Facility. We are working to improve our operating performance and our cash, liquidity and financial position. This includes: pursuing the sale of non-strategic surplus land and coal reserves as well as existing mines, particularly the sale of our El Segundo and Lee Ranch coal mines and related assets located in New Mexico and our Twentymile Mine in Colorado; continuing to drive cost improvements across the company, attempting to negotiate alternative payment terms with creditors; maintaining our current level of self-bonding and/or replacing self-bonding with other financial instruments on reasonable terms; evaluating potential debt buybacks, debt exchanges and new financing to improve our liquidity and reduce our financial obligations; and obtaining waivers of going concern and financial covenant violations under the 2013 Credit Facility. We have engaged financial and other advisors to assist us in those efforts.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nHowever, there can be no assurance that our plan to improve our operating performance and financial position will be successful or that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As a result, our liquidity and ability to timely pay our obligations when due could be adversely affected. Furthermore, our creditors may resist renegotiation or lengthening of payment and other terms through legal action or otherwise. If we are not able to timely, successfully or efficiently implement the strategies that we are pursuing to improve our operating performance and financial position, obtain alternative sources of capital or otherwise meet our liquidity needs, we may need to voluntarily seek protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nOur profitability depends upon the prices we receive for our coal.\nDepressed coal prices have reduced our revenues, and sustained prices at current levels or further declines in coal prices will adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Further declines in coal prices will adversely affect the value of our coal reserves.\nCoal prices are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe strength of the global economy;\n\u2022\nthe demand for electricity;\n\u2022\nthe demand for steel, which may lead to price fluctuations in the periodic repricing of our metallurgical coal contracts;\n\u2022\nthe global supply and production costs of thermal and metallurgical coal;\n\u2022\nchanges in the fuel consumption patterns of electric power generators;\n\u2022\nweather patterns and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ncompetition within our industry and the availability, quality and price of alternative fuels, including natural gas, fuel oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, biomass and solar power;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity and cost of transportation and terminal facilities;\n\u2022\ncoal and natural gas industry output and capacity;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations and taxes, including those establishing air emission standards for coal-fueled power plants or mandating or subsidizing increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources;\n\u2022\nregulatory, administrative and judicial decisions, including those affecting future mining permits and leases; and\n\u2022\ntechnological developments, including those related to alternative energy sources, those intended to convert coal-to-liquids or gas and those aimed at capturing, using and storing carbon dioxide.\nCoal prices are currently depressed based on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. If coal prices decline further, our operating results and profitability and value of our coal reserves could be materially and adversely affected. For example, our revenues decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year by $1,183.0 million, primarily due to lower realized coal pricing and lower sales volumes driven by demand and production factors described in this risk factor.\nIn the U.S., our strategy is to selectively renew, or enter into new, long-term supply agreements when we can do so at prices we believe are favorable. In Australia, current industry practice, and our typical practice, is to negotiate pricing for metallurgical coal contracts quarterly and seaborne thermal coal contracts annually, with a portion sold on a shorter-term basis.\nThermal coal accounted for the majority of our coal sales during 2015. The majority of our sales of thermal coal were to electric power generators. The demand for coal consumed for electric power generation is affected by many of the factors described above, but primarily by (i) the overall demand for electricity; (ii) the availability, quality and price of competing fuels, such as natural gas, nuclear fuel, oil and alternative energy sources; (iii) increasingly stringent environmental and other governmental regulations; and (iv) the coal inventories of utilities. Gas-fueled generation has the potential to displace coal-fueled generation, particularly from older, less efficient coal-powered generators. Many of the new power plants in the U.S. may be fueled by natural gas because gas-fired plants are viewed as cheaper to construct and permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain as natural gas is seen as having a lower environmental impact than coal-fueled generators. Increasingly stringent regulations have also reduced the number of new power plants being built. These trends have reduced demand for our coal and the related prices. Any further reduction in the amount of coal consumed by electric power generators could reduce the price of coal that we mine and sell.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nLower demand for metallurgical coal by steel producers would reduce our revenues and could further reduce the price of our metallurgical coal. We produce metallurgical coal that is used in the global steel industry. Metallurgical coal accounted for approximately 21.4% and 24.1% of our coal sales revenue in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Any deterioration in conditions in the steel industry, including the demand for steel and the continued financial condition of the industry, would reduce the demand for our metallurgical coal. Lower demand for metallurgical coal in international markets would reduce the amount of metallurgical coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves.\nAdditionally, we compete with numerous other domestic and foreign coal producers for domestic and international sales. This competition affects domestic and foreign coal prices and our ability to attract and retain customers. Overcapacity and increased production within the coal industry, both domestically and internationally, could materially reduce coal prices and therefore materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition to competing with other coal producers, we compete generally with producers of other fuels, such as natural gas. Further declines in the price of natural gas, or continued low natural gas prices, could cause demand for coal to decrease and adversely affect the price of coal. Sustained periods of low natural gas prices or other fuels may also cause utilities to phase out or close existing coal-fired power plants or reduce construction of new coal-fired power plants, which could have a material adverse effect on demand and prices for our coal, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nIf a substantial number of our long-term coal supply agreements terminate, our revenues and operating profits could suffer if we are unable to find alternate buyers willing to purchase our coal on comparable terms to those in our contracts.\nMost of our sales are made under coal supply agreements, which are important to the stability and profitability of our operations. The execution of a satisfactory coal supply agreement is frequently the basis on which we undertake the development of coal reserves required to be supplied under the contract, particularly in the U.S.\nMany of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that permit the parties to adjust the contract price upward or downward at specified times. We may adjust these contract prices based on inflation or deflation and/or changes in the factors affecting the cost of producing coal, such as taxes, fees, royalties and changes in the laws regulating the mining, production, sale or use of coal. In a limited number of contracts, failure of the parties to agree on a price under those provisions may allow either party to terminate the contract. We sometimes experience a reduction in coal prices in new long-term coal supply agreements replacing some of our expiring contracts. Coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party. Most of our coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as Btu, sulfur content, ash content, grindability and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts. Moreover, some of these agreements allow our customers to terminate their contracts in the event of changes in regulations affecting our industry that restrict the use or type of coal permissible at the customer\u2019s plant or increase the price of coal beyond specified limits.\nThe operating profits we realize from coal sold under supply agreements depend on a variety of factors. In addition, price adjustment and other provisions may increase our exposure to short-term coal price volatility provided by those contracts. If a substantial portion of our coal supply agreements were modified or terminated, we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to find alternate buyers for our coal at the same level of profitability. Market prices for coal vary by mining region and country. As a result, we cannot predict the future strength of the coal market overall or by mining region and cannot provide assurance that we will be able to replace existing long-term coal supply agreements at the same prices or with similar profit margins when they expire.\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived 26% of our total revenues from our five largest customers, similar to the prior year. Those five customers were supplied primarily from 31 coal supply agreements (excluding trading transactions) expiring at various times from 2016 to 2026. The contract contributing the greatest amount of annual revenue in 2015 was approximately $285 million, or approximately 5% of our 2015 total revenue base. We are currently discussing the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long-term agreements with some of these customers, but these negotiations may not be successful and those customers may not continue to purchase coal from us under long-term coal supply agreements. If a number of these customers significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, or if we are unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially. In addition, our revenue could be adversely affected by a decline in customer purchases (including contractually obligated purchases) due to lack of demand and oversupply, cost of competing fuels and environmental and other governmental regulations.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nOur trading and hedging activities may expose us to earnings volatility and other risks.\nWe enter into hedging arrangements designed primarily to manage market price volatility of foreign currency (primarily the Australian dollar), diesel fuel and coal. Also, from time to time, we manage the interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate borrowings and commodity price risk associated with explosives using swaps. Generally, we attempt to designate hedging arrangements as cash flow hedges with gains or losses recorded as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity until the hedged transaction occurs (or until hedge ineffectiveness is determined). While we utilize a variety of risk monitoring and mitigation strategies, those strategies require judgment and they cannot anticipate every potential outcome or the timing of such outcomes. As such, there is potential for these hedges to no longer qualify for hedge accounting, which occurred at December 31, 2015. As such, beginning January 1, 2016, we will be required to recognize the mark-to-market movements through current year earnings, possibly resulting in increased volatility in our income in future periods. In addition, to the extent that we engage in hedging activities, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of future price changes of foreign currency, diesel fuel and coal.\nWe also enter into derivative trading instruments, some of which require us to post margin based on the value of those instruments and other credit factors. If our credit is downgraded, the fair value of our hedge portfolio moves significantly, or laws or regulations are passed requiring all hedge arrangements to be exchange-traded or exchange-cleared, we could be required to post additional margin, which could impact our liquidity.\nThrough our trading and hedging activities, we are also exposed to the nonperformance and credit risk with various counterparties, including exchanges and other financial intermediaries. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements, which could negatively impact our profitability and/or liquidity. In addition, some of our trading and brokerage activities include an increasing number of exchange-settled transactions, which expose us to the margin requirements of the exchange for daily changes in the value of our positions. If there are significant and extended unfavorable price movements against our positions, or if there are future regulations that impose new margin requirements, position limits and capital charges, even if not directly applicable to us, our liquidity could be impacted.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and financial market conditions.\nIn recent years, the global economic recession and the worldwide financial and credit market disruptions had a negative impact on us and on the coal industry generally. If any of these conditions return, if coal prices continue at or below levels experienced in 2015 for a prolonged period or if there are further downturns in economic conditions, particularly in developing countries such as China and India, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. While we are focused on cost control, productivity improvements, increased contributions from our higher-margin operations and capital discipline, there can be no assurance that these actions, or any others we may take, will be sufficient in response to challenging economic and financial conditions.\nOur ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness or contractual performance deteriorates.\nOur ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered or for financially settled contracts depends on the continued creditworthiness and contractual performance of our customers and counterparties. Our customer base has changed with deregulation in the U.S. as utilities have sold their power plants to their non-regulated affiliates or third parties. These new customers may have credit ratings that are below investment grade or are not rated. If deterioration of the creditworthiness of our customers occurs or they fail to perform the terms of their contracts with us, our accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected.\nRisks inherent to mining could increase the cost of operating our business.\nOur mining operations are subject to conditions that can impact the safety of our workforce, or delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time. These conditions include fires and explosions from methane gas or coal dust; accidental mine water discharges; weather, flooding and natural disasters; unexpected maintenance problems; unforeseen delays in implementation of mining technologies that are new to our operations; key equipment failures; variations in coal seam thickness; variations in coal quality; variations in the amount of rock and soil overlying the coal deposit; variations in rock and other natural materials and variations in geologic conditions. We maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some of these risks, although there can be no assurance that these risks would be fully covered by our insurance policies. Despite our efforts, such conditions could occur and have a substantial impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nIf transportation for our coal becomes unavailable or uneconomic for our customers, our ability to sell coal could suffer.\nTransportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal use and the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs and the lack of sufficient rail and port capacity could lead to reduced coal sales.\nWe depend upon rail, barge, trucking, overland conveyor and ocean-going vessels to deliver coal to our customers. While our coal customers typically arrange and pay for transportation of coal from the mine or port to the point of use, disruption of these transportation services because of weather-related problems, infrastructure damage, strikes, lock-outs, lack of fuel or maintenance items, underperformance of the port and rail infrastructure, congestion and balancing systems which are imposed to manage vessel queuing and demurrage, non-performance or delays by co-shippers, transportation delays or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to our customers and thus could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA decrease in the availability or increase in costs of key supplies, capital equipment or commodities such as diesel fuel, steel, explosives and tires could decrease our anticipated profitability.\nOur mining operations require a reliable supply of mining equipment, replacement parts, fuel, explosives, tires, steel-related products (including roof control materials), lubricants and electricity. There has been some consolidation in the supplier base providing mining materials to the coal industry, such as with suppliers of explosives in the U.S. and both surface and underground equipment globally, that has limited the number of sources for these materials. In situations where we have chosen to concentrate a large portion of purchases with one supplier, it has been to take advantage of cost savings from larger volumes of purchases and to ensure security of supply. If the cost of any of these inputs increased significantly, or if a source for these supplies or mining equipment were unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our profitability could be reduced or we could experience a delay or halt in our production.\nTake-or-pay arrangements within the coal industry could unfavorably affect our profitability.\nWe have substantial take-or-pay arrangements, predominately in Australia, totaling $2.2 billion, with terms ranging up to 27 years, that commit us to pay a minimum amount for rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal even if those commitments go unused. The take-or-pay provisions in these contracts allow us to subsequently apply take-or-pay payments made to deliveries subsequently taken, but these provisions have limitations and we may not be able to utilize all such amounts paid if the limitations apply or if we do not subsequently take sufficient volumes to utilize the amounts previously paid. Additionally, coal companies, including us, may continue to deliver coal during times when it might otherwise be optimal to suspend operations because these take-or-pay provisions effectively convert a variable cost of selling coal to a fixed operating cost.\nAn inability of trading, brokerage, mining or freight counterparties to fulfill the terms of their contracts with us could reduce our profitability.\nIn conducting our trading, brokerage and mining operations, we utilize third-party sources of coal production and transportation, including contract miners and brokerage sources, to fulfill deliveries under our coal supply agreements. While we have completed several conversions to owner-operator status at certain of our Australian operations, a portion of our sales volume continues to come from mines that utilize contract miners. Employee relations at mines that use contract miners are the responsibility of the contractor.\nOur profitability or exposure to loss on transactions or relationships is dependent upon the reliability (including financial viability) and price of the third-party suppliers; our obligation to supply coal to customers in the event that weather, flooding, natural disasters or adverse geologic mining conditions restrict deliveries from our suppliers; our willingness to participate in temporary cost increases experienced by our third-party coal suppliers; our ability to pass on temporary cost increases to our customers; the ability to substitute, when economical, third-party coal sources with internal production or coal purchased in the market and the ability of our freight sources to fulfill their delivery obligations. Market volatility and price increases for coal or freight on the international and domestic markets could result in non-performance by third-party suppliers under existing contracts with us, in order to take advantage of the higher prices in the current market. Such non-performance could have an adverse impact on our ability to fulfill deliveries under our coal supply agreements.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nWe may not recover our investments in our mining, exploration and other assets, which may require us to recognize impairment charges related to those assets.\nThe value of our assets may be adversely affected by numerous uncertain factors, some of which are beyond our control, including unfavorable changes in the economic environments in which we operate, lower-than-expected coal pricing, technical and geological operating difficulties, an inability to economically extract our coal reserves and unanticipated increases in operating costs. These may cause us to fail to recover all or a portion of our investments in those assets and may trigger the recognition of impairment charges in the future, which could have a substantial impact on our results of operations.\nAs described in Note 2. \"Asset Impairment\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we recognized aggregate asset impairment and mine closure costs of $1,277.8 million, $154.4 million and $528.3 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Because of the volatile and cyclical nature of U.S. and international coal markets, it is reasonably possible that our current estimates of projected future cash flows from our mining assets may change in the near term, which may result in the need for further adjustments to the carrying value of those assets or adjustments to assets not previously impaired.\nOur ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or fail to attract qualified personnel.\nWe manage our business with a number of key personnel, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on us, absent the completion of an orderly transition. In addition, we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel, particularly personnel with mining experience. We cannot provide assurance that key personnel will continue to be employed by us or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 7,600 employees (excluding employees that were employed at operations classified as discontinued), which included approximately 5,700 hourly employees. Approximately 37% of our hourly employees were represented by organized labor unions and generated 20% of 2015 coal production. Additionally, those employed through contract mining relationships in Australia are also members of trade unions. Relations with our employees and, where applicable, organized labor are important to our success. If some or all of our current non-union operations were to become unionized, we could incur an increased risk of work stoppages, reduced productivity and higher labor costs. Also, if we fail to maintain good relations with our union workforce, we could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could negatively impact our profitability.\nOur mining operations could be adversely affected if we fail to appropriately secure our obligations.\nU.S. federal and state laws and Australian laws require us to secure certain of our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining, to pay federal and state workers\u2019 compensation, to secure coal lease obligations and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. The primary methods we use to meet those obligations are to post a corporate guarantee (i.e., self bond), provide a third-party surety bond or provide a letter of credit. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1,430.8 million of self bonding in place for our reclamation obligations. As of December 31, 2015, we also had outstanding surety bonds with third parties, bank guarantees and letters of credit of $1,045.7 million, of which $592.3 million was for post-mining reclamation, $75.0 million related to workers\u2019 compensation obligations, $110.5 million was for coal lease obligations and $267.9 million was for other obligations, including road maintenance and performance guarantees. During 2015, we were required to increase our total posted letters of credit by $429.2 million to the issuing parties of certain of our surety bonds and bank guarantees, whereas we had not previously been required to do so. Surety bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis. Surety bond issuers may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals, which may in turn affect our available liquidity. Our ability to maintain and acquire letters of credit is subject to us maintaining compliance under our two primary facilities used for such items, which are our 2013 Credit Facility and our accounts receivable securitization program.\nOur failure to retain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds, bank guarantees or letters of credit, or to provide a suitable alternative, would have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including the following:\n\u2022\nlack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the availability of collateral for current and future third-party surety bond issuers under the terms of our indentures or our 2013 Credit Facility;\n\u2022\nthe exercise by third-party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to renew our 2013 Credit Facility or our accounts receivable securitization program or a default or lack of availability of letters of credit thereunder.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nOur ability to self-bond reduces our costs of providing financial assurances. To the extent we are unable to maintain our current level of self-bonding due to legislative or regulatory changes, changes in our financial condition or for any other reason, we would be required to obtain replacement financial assurances. Further, self-bonding is permitted at the discretion of each state. While we have historically demonstrated compliance with the applicable financial requirements in the states in which we self-bond, our self-bonding status may be challenged or withdrawn at any time. The OSM has recently issued notices to one or more states alleging possible violations relating to the continued self-bonding by coal companies, including us, in that state. The notices require the violation to be corrected or for the state to explain why a violation does not exist. As a result of any adverse change in our ability to self-bond, our costs would increase and our liquidity available for other uses would be reduced to the extent of any collateral required to obtain replacement financial assurances.\nOur mining operations are extensively regulated, which impose significant costs on us, and future regulations and developments could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal.\nThe coal mining industry is subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to matters such as:\n\u2022\nemployee health and safety;\n\u2022\nlimitations on land use;\n\u2022\nmine permitting and licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nreclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed;\n\u2022\nthe storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n\u2022\nremediation of contaminated soil and groundwater;\n\u2022\nair quality standards;\n\u2022\nwater pollution;\n\u2022\nprotection of human health, plant-life and wildlife, including endangered or threatened species;\n\u2022\nprotection of wetlands;\n\u2022\nthe discharge of materials into the environment; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of mining on surface water and groundwater quality and availability.\nRegulatory agencies have the authority under certain circumstances following significant health and safety incidents to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed. In the event that such agencies ordered the closing of one of our mines, our production and sale of coal would be disrupted and we may be required to incur cash outlays to re-open the mine. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe possibility exists that new legislation or regulations and orders, including without limitation related to the environment or employee health and safety may be adopted and may materially adversely affect our mining operations, our cost structure or our customers\u2019 ability to use coal. New legislation or administrative regulations (or new interpretations by the relevant government of existing laws and regulations), including proposals related to the protection of the environment or the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs. Some of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchaser\u2019s plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use. These factors and legislation, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor additional information, see the sections entitled \"Regulatory Matters-U.S.\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Matters-Australia\u201d for more information about the various regulations affecting us.\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nOur operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time. A number of laws, including in the U.S., CERCLA and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), impose liability relating to contamination by hazardous substances. Such liability may involve the costs of investigating or remediating contamination and damages to natural resources, as well as claims seeking to recover for property damage or personal injury caused by hazardous substances. Such liability may arise from conditions at formerly, as well as currently, owned or operated properties, and at properties to which hazardous substances have been sent for treatment, disposal or other handling. Liability under RCRA, CERCLA and similar state statutes is without regard to fault, and typically is joint and several, meaning that a person may be held responsible for more than its share, or even all, of the liability involved.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nIn addition, we have accrued for liability arising out of contamination associated with Gold Fields Mining, LLC (Gold Fields), a dormant, non-coal-producing subsidiary of ours that was previously managed and owned by Hanson PLC, or with Gold Fields\u2019 former affiliates. Hanson PLC, which is a predecessor owner of ours, transferred ownership of Gold Fields to us in the February 1997 spin-off of its energy business. Gold Fields is currently a defendant in several lawsuits and has received notices of several other potential claims arising out of lead contamination from mining and milling operations. Gold Fields is also involved in investigating or remediating a number of other contaminated sites. See Note 24. \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements for a description of pending legal proceedings involving Gold Fields.\nWe may be unable to obtain and renew permits necessary for our operations, which would reduce our production, cash flows and profitability.\nNumerous governmental and tribal permits and approvals are required for mining operations. The permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex and are often subject to discretionary interpretations by regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or impractical. As part of this process, we are required to prepare and present to governmental authorities data pertaining to the effect that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment. The public, including non-governmental organizations, opposition groups and individuals, have statutory rights to comment upon and submit objections to requested permits and approvals. In recent years, the permitting required for coal mining has been the subject of increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and extensive litigation by environmental groups.\nThe costs, liabilities and requirements associated with these regulations and opposition may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production and as a result, adversely affect our coal production, cash flows and profitability. Further, required permits may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, or permits issued or renewed may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to efficiently and economically conduct our mining activities, any of which would materially reduce our production, cash flow and profitability.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates certain activities affecting navigable waters and waters of the U.S., including wetlands. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires mining companies like us to obtain Corps permits to place material in streams for the purpose of creating slurry ponds, water impoundments, refuse areas, valley fills or other mining activities. In recent years, the Section 404 permitting process has been subject to increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and a series of court challenges, which have resulted in increased costs and delays in the permitting process. Additionally, increasingly stringent requirements governing coal mining also are being considered or implemented under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit process and various other environmental programs. Potential laws, regulations and policies could result in material adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow, in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these potential laws, regulations and policies.\nOur mining operations are subject to extensive forms of taxation, which imposes significant costs on us, and future regulations and developments could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal competitively.\nFederal, state, provincial or local governmental authorities in nearly all countries across the global coal mining industry impose various forms of taxation, including production taxes, sales-related taxes, royalties, environmental taxes, mining profits taxes and income taxes. If new legislation or regulations related to various forms of coal taxation, which increase our costs or limit our ability to compete in the areas in which we sell our coal, are adopted, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf the assumptions underlying our asset retirement obligations for reclamation and mine closures are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated.\nOur asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. These obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, which is driven by the estimated economic life of the mine and the applicable reclamation laws. These cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. Our management and engineers periodically review these estimates. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation, mine closing and post-closure activities. The resulting estimated asset retirement obligation could change significantly if actual amounts change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nOur future success depends upon our ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves that are economically recoverable.\nOur recoverable reserves decline as we produce coal. We have not yet applied for the permits required or developed the mines necessary to use all of our reserves. Moreover, the amount of proven and probable coal reserves described in Part I, Item 2. \u201cProperties\u201d involved the use of certain estimates and those estimates could be inaccurate. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable coal reserve estimates include geological conditions, historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future prices and future operating costs. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our coal reserves may vary materially from estimates.\nOur future success depends upon our conducting successful exploration and development activities or acquiring properties containing economically recoverable reserves. Our current strategy includes increasing our reserves through acquisitions of government and other leases and producing properties and continuing to use our existing properties and infrastructure. In certain locations, leases for oil, natural gas and coalbed methane reserves are located on, or adjacent to, some of our reserves, potentially creating conflicting interests between us and lessees of those interests. Other lessees\u2019 rights relating to these mineral interests could prevent, delay or increase the cost of developing our coal reserves. These lessees may also seek damages from us based on claims that our coal mining operations impair their interests. Additionally, the U.S. federal government limits the amount of federal land that may be leased by any company to 75,000 acres in any one state and 150,000 acres nationwide. As of December 31, 2015, we leased a total of 69,145 acres from the federal government subject to those limitations. On January 15, 2016, the Interior Department announced that it will perform a review of the federal coal leasing program. The Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell ordered a pause on issuing new coal leases which the Interior Department expects to continue for three years. If this limitation were to continue significantly beyond three years, it could restrict our ability to lease additional U.S. federal lands and coal reserves critical to our Western U.S mining and Powder River Basin mining segments.\nOur planned mine development projects and acquisition activities may not result in significant additional reserves, and we may not have success developing additional mines. Most of our mining operations are conducted on properties owned or leased by us. Because we do not thoroughly verify title to most of our leased properties and mineral rights until we obtain a permit to mine the property, our right to mine some of our reserves may be materially adversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist. In order to conduct our mining operations on properties where these defects exist, we may incur unanticipated costs. In addition, in order to develop our reserves, we must also own the rights to the related surface property and receive various governmental permits. We cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the permits or appropriate land access necessary for us to operate profitably in the future. We may not be able to negotiate new leases from the government or from private parties, obtain mining contracts for properties containing additional reserves or maintain our leasehold interest in properties on which mining operations have not commenced or have not met minimum quantity or product royalty requirements. From time to time, we have experienced litigation with lessors of our coal properties and with royalty holders. In addition, from time to time, our permit applications have been challenged, causing production delays.\nTo the extent that our existing sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund our planned mine development projects and reserve acquisition activities, we may require access to capital markets, which may not be available to us or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. If we are unable to fund these activities, we may not be able to maintain or increase our existing production rates and we could be forced to change our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur global operations increase our exposure to risks unique to international mining and trading operations.\nOur international platform increases our exposure to country risks and the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. Some of our international activities are in developing countries where the economic strength, business practices and counterparty reputations may not be as well developed as in our U.S. or Australian operations. We are exposed to various political risks, including political instability, the potential for expropriation of assets, costs associated with the repatriation of earnings and the potential for unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. Despite our efforts to mitigate these risks, our results of operations, financial position or cash flow could be adversely affected by these activities.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nJoint ventures, partnerships or non-managed operations may not be successful and may not comply with our operating standards.\nWe participate in several joint venture and partnership arrangements and may enter into others, all of which necessarily involve risk. Whether or not we hold majority interests or maintain operational control in our joint ventures, our partners may, among other things, (1) have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with, or opposed to, ours; (2) seek to block actions that we believe are in our or the joint venture\u2019s best interests or (3) be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or other agreements, such as contributing capital, each of which may adversely impact our results of operations and our liquidity or impair our ability to recover our investments.\nWhere our joint ventures are jointly controlled or not managed by us, we may provide expertise and advice but have limited control over compliance with our operational standards. We also utilize contractors across our mining platform, and may be similarly limited in our ability to control their operational practices. Failure by non-controlled joint venture partners or contractors to adhere to operational standards that are equivalent to ours could unfavorably affect operating costs and productivity and adversely impact our results of operations and reputation.\nAs a result of our continuing efforts to reduce costs and optimize our organizational structure, we may undertake further restructuring plans that would require additional charges.\nIn 2015, we expanded our repositioning efforts to include voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions and office closures and initiated plans to consolidate certain shared services globally, and correspondingly incurred $23.5 million in aggregate charges during that period. As a result of our continuing review of our business, we may choose to further reduce our workforce and close additional offices in the future, which may result in further restructuring charges and cash expenditures and the consumption of management resources, any of which could cause our operating results to decline and may fail to yield the expected benefits.\nWe could be exposed to significant liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs or other risks if we sustain cyber attacks or other security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us, our customers or other third-parties.\nWe have implemented security protocols and systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our operations and protecting our and our counterparties' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access. Despite such efforts, we may be subject to security breaches which could result in unauthorized access to our facilities or the information we are trying to protect. Unauthorized physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, litigation by affected parties, damage to sources of competitive advantage, disruptions to our operations, loss of customers, financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information and costs to remediate such security vulnerabilities, any of which could have a substantial impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nRisks Associated with Our Indebtedness\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected by our substantial indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was $6.3 billion, and we had $940.0 million of maximum borrowing capacity under the 2013 Revolver portion of our 2013 Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. Our 2013 Credit Facility and our Senior Secured Second Lien Notes contain covenants limiting the amount of indebtedness we may incur, however, the indentures governing our Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures (the Debentures) and the 7.875%, 6.50%, 6.25% and 6.00% Senior Notes (collectively our Senior Notes) do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may issue. The addition of new debt to our current debt levels could increase the related risks that we now face. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreasing the costs of borrowing under our existing credit facilities or newly issued debt obligations;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy the financial covenants in our 2013 Revolver;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, business development or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business development or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness when it becomes due;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to obtain bank guarantees, surety bonds, letters of credit or other financing, particularly during periods in which credit markets are weak;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the coal industry;\n\u2022\ndemands by contract counterparties for adequate assurances or the refusal of third parties to contract with us could impact performance and reduce liquidity;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to provide credit support, or additional credit support, for our current obligations and future obligations which we may seek to incur;\n\u2022\ncausing a decline in our credit ratings; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors.\nIn addition, our debt agreements subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants. Failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us and result in amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, which could also result in a cross-default or cross-acceleration of our other indebtedness. As noted above, our current operating plan indicates that we will incur a loss from operations, generate negative cash flows and, unless we achieve certain targeted asset sales, violate certain financial and restrictive covenants. The inclusion of a \"going concern\" explanatory paragraph in the auditor's opinion covering our audited financial statements contained herein, absent a waiver or cure, would constitute a default under the 2013 Credit Facility after the expiration of any applicable grace period.\nPrevious downgrades in our credit ratings have resulted in us posting additional collateral with respect to derivative trading instruments and certain agreements with our customers. Any future downgrade in our credit ratings could result in additional requirements to post collateral on derivative trading instruments and certain agreements with our customers, the loss of trading counterparties for corporate hedging and trading and brokerage activities or an increase in the cost of, or a limit on our access to, various forms of credit used in operating our business.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt services obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations or seek to restructure or refinance certain debt obligations. We have engaged in discussions with certain holders of our debt regarding debt exchanges and debt buybacks, as well as new financings. However, these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt services obligations. In this regard, certain agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to sell assets and the manner in which we may use proceeds from asset sales. We also may not be able to complete any such asset sales or realize sufficient proceeds to meet debt service obligations then due. In addition, our ability to restructure our debt obligations may be impacted by cash tax liabilities that result from the cancellation of debt income if we are unable to offset that income with tax losses or other tax planning strategies. If the actions described above are not successful and we are unable to meet our debt service obligations when due, we could be required to reorganize our company in its entirety, including through bankruptcy proceedings.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nOur ability to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations is dependent upon market conditions and our continued access to borrowing capacity of our existing borrowing facilities.\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that we may not be able to generate or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity typically includes the available balances from the 2013 Revolver under the 2013 Credit Facility and our accounts receivable securitization program that expires in April 2016. In February 2016, we borrowed approximately $945 million under our 2013 Revolver, which represented the then-remaining undrawn available amount. In order for our liquidity to be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements, we must maintain our cash or, to the extent amounts once again become available for borrowing, continue to have access to a substantial portion of our maximum borrowing capacity under the 2013 Revolver. Our ability to borrow under the 2013 Revolver is dependent upon our ability to comply with the covenants in the 2013 Credit Facility. As noted above, our current operating plan indicates that we will incur a loss from operations, generate negative cash flows and, unless we achieve certain targeted asset sales, violate certain financial and restrictive covenants. The inclusion of a \"going concern\" explanatory paragraph in the auditor's opinion covering our audited financial statements contained herein, absent a waiver or cure, would constitute a default under the 2013 Credit Facility after the expiration of any applicable grace period.\nAs of March 11, 2016, our available liquidity declined to $0.9 billion, which consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The decline since December 31, 2015 was primarily due to operational expenditures and the issuance of additional letters of credit.\nDue to significant pressure on our business and current market conditions facing the coal industry, we have experienced losses of $1,996.0 million and $787.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and cash outflows from operations of $14.4 million in 2015. We expect to continue to experience operating losses and cash outflows from operations in the coming quarters, until the coal industry stabilizes. We have taken steps to reduce the cash outflow from operations in the near term through a realignment of our cost structure and anticipated reductions in production volumes, but these actions will not entirely address our cash outflows from operations.\nOther factors that could materially adversely impact our liquidity include an inability to maintain our current level of self-bonding, requirements to provide additional collateral to support our operations, an inability to renew our accounts receivable securitization program at an appropriate capacity when it expires in April 2016, further downgrades of our credit ratings and additional obligations or liabilities that we may incur as a result of the Patriot bankruptcy. Access to additional funds from liquidity-generating transactions or other sources of external financing may not be available to us and, if available, would be subject to market conditions and certain limitations including our credit rating and covenant restrictions in the agreements governing our debt, including our 2013 Credit Facility.\nWe have engaged in discussions with holders of our debt regarding new financings as well as debt exchanges and debt buybacks to improve our liquidity and reduce our financial obligations. If we are not able to timely, successfully or efficiently implement the strategies that we are pursuing to improve our operating performance and financial position, obtain alternative sources of capital or otherwise meet our liquidity needs or maintain covenant compliance under our 2013 Credit Facility, we may need to voluntarily seek protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nThe covenants in our 2013 Credit Facility, and the indentures governing our Senior Notes, Senior Secured Second Lien Notes and Debentures impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur 2013 Credit Facility, the indentures governing our Senior Notes, and our Senior Secured Second Lien Notes and the instruments governing our other indebtedness contain certain restrictions and covenants which restrict our ability to incur liens and/or debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person. Under our 2013 Credit Facility, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis, including a maximum consolidated net secured first lien leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, each as defined therein. The covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures and unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness and the imposition of liens on our assets. Also, because our ability to borrow under the 2013 Credit Facility is conditioned upon compliance with these covenants, any available borrowing capacity under the 2013 Credit Facility may be limited or may be altogether precluded. If we do not remain in compliance with the covenants in our 2013 Credit Facility, we may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, sell assets and make redemptions or repurchase capital stock. Also, because our ability to borrow under the 2013 Credit Facility is conditioned upon compliance with these covenants, our borrowing capacity under the 2013 Credit Facility may be limited or may be altogether precluded. As noted above, our current operating plan indicates that we will incur a loss from operations, generate negative cash flows and, unless we achieve certain targeted asset sales, violate certain financial and restrictive covenants in 2016. The inclusion of a \"going concern\" explanatory paragraph in the auditor's opinion covering our audited financial statements contained herein, absent a waiver or cure, would constitute a default under the 2013 Credit Facility after the expiration of any applicable grace period.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nWe currently anticipate that our reported Adjusted EBITDA and other sources of earnings or adjustments used to calculate Consolidated EBITDA (if such other sources of earnings or adjustments do not include the proceeds of certain targeted asset sales) will fall below our Consolidated Net Cash Interest Charges during 2016, and we anticipate we will not comply with our financial covenants as of March 31, 2016. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from our lenders and the debt under our 2013 Credit Facility is accelerated, there would be an event of default under our Senior Notes, and our Senior Secured Second Lien Notes and the debt owing thereunder could be accelerated. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our debt or equity securities and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions.\nUnder the indentures governing our Senior Notes, the amount of Indebtedness (as defined in the indentures governing the Senior Notes) that may be secured by Principal Property and Capital Stock (each as defined in the Senior Notes indentures) is limited in amount, unless the Senior Notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis. Our 2013 Credit Facility and our Senior Secured Second Lien Notes are secured by Principal Property and Capital Stock, among other collateral, in a manner that uses substantially all of such limited amount. While the 2013 Credit Facility and our Senior Secured Second Lien Notes provide us with flexibility to secure certain other debt with Principal Property and Capital Stock while maintaining compliance with the terms of our Senior Notes indentures and not requiring such notes to be equally and ratably secured, our ability to incur such other secured debt is limited, and our ability to secure any debt in the future, whether or not secured by Principal Property and Capital Stock, may be negatively affected by such constraints. In addition, under the 2013 Credit Facility, if we cannot meet our debt service obligations, payment of our outstanding debt could be accelerated, the lenders could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy.\nThe conversion of our Debentures, sales of additional shares of our common stock and the exercise or granting of additional equity securities may result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nIf the conditions permitting the conversion of our Debentures are met and holders of the Debentures exercise their conversion rights, any conversion value in excess of the principal amount will be delivered in shares of our common stock. If any common stock is issued in connection with a conversion of our Debentures, our existing stockholders will experience dilution in the voting power of their common stock.\nProvisions of our Debentures could discourage an acquisition of us by a third-party.\nCertain provisions of our Debentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third-party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a \u201cchange of control\u201d as defined in the indenture relating to our Debentures, holders of our Debentures will have the right, at their option, to convert their Debentures and thereby require us to pay the principal amount of such Debentures in cash and, if applicable, shares of our Common Stock. Future issuances of equity securities, including issuances pursuant to outstanding stock-based awards under our long-term incentive plans, could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders and could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. We may issue equity or equity-linked securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, adjust our ratio of debt to equity, satisfy claims or obligations or for other reasons.\nWe may be unable to repurchase or make payments associated with our debt if we experience a change of control\nIf we experiences specific kinds of changes in control and the credit rating assigned to our Senior Notes declines below specified levels within 90 days of that time, holders of such notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. In addition, as discussed above, certain provisions of our Debentures provide that upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a change of control, holders of our Debentures will have the right, at their option, to convert their Debentures and thereby require us to pay the principal amount of such Debentures in cash and, if applicable, shares of our Common Stock. If a change of control were to occur, we may not have sufficient funds to purchase our Senior Notes or pay amounts required by our Debentures. We also might not be able to obtain additional financing to fund those purchases and payments. Our failure to repurchase or make payments with respect to our Senior Notes and Debentures upon a change of control would cause a default under the relevant indentures and a cross default under our other indentures and our credit facility. A change of control (as defined for purposes of our credit facility) is also an event of default under the credit facility that would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of certain borrowings.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nOther Business Risks\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, most significantly Australia. As of December 31, 2015, we had gross deferred income tax assets and liabilities of $2,597.1 million and $1,167.0 million, respectively, as described further in Note 10. \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. At that date, we also had recorded a valuation allowance of $1,447.3 million, substantially comprised of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset positions in the U.S. and Australia driven by recent cumulative book losses, as determined by considering all sources of available income (including items classified as discontinued operations or recorded directly to \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\"), which limited our ability to look to future taxable income in assessing the likelihood of realizing those assets.\nAlthough we may be able to utilize some or all of those deferred tax assets in the future if we have income of the appropriate character in those jurisdictions (subject to loss carryforward and tax credit expiry, in certain cases), there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Further, we are presently unable to record tax benefits on future losses in the U.S. and Australia until such time as sufficient income is generated by our operations in those jurisdictions to support the realization of the related net deferred tax asset positions. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may adversely be affected in future periods by these limitations.\nWe are exposed to risk of loss due to Patriot's bankruptcy.\nIn 2012, Patriot Coal Company and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries (Patriot) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code. In 2013, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement with Patriot and the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), on behalf of itself, its represented Patriot employees and its represented Patriot retirees, to resolve all disputed issues related to Patriot\u2019s bankruptcy. In May 2015, Patriot again filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code in the Eastern District of Virginia and subsequently initiated a process to sell some or all of its assets to qualified third-party bidders. On October 9, 2015, the bankruptcy court overseeing Patriot's current bankruptcy confirmed a plan of reorganization that sold substantially all of Patriot's assets to two buyers and contributed the remainder to a liquidating trust. The plan became effective in late October 2015.\nWe have exposure related to a total of $83.1 million of credit support we provided to Patriot pursuant to the 2013 definitive settlement agreement (net of $8.5 million of underlying liabilities assumed and $29.9 million of financial instruments drawn upon in 2015). Refer to Note 25. \"Matters Related to the Bankruptcy of Patriot Coal Corporation\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information surrounding these risks.\nBy statute, we remain secondarily liable for the black lung liabilities related to Patriot\u2019s workers employed by our former subsidiaries. Whether we will ultimately be required to fund certain of those obligations in the future as a result of Patriot\u2019s May 2015 bankruptcy remains uncertain. We do believe that it is probable that we will be required to fund a portion of these obligations in the future and recorded a charge to \"Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\" of $114.4 million, net of $15.0 million previously accrued credit support related to Patriot's federal black lung obligations, during the year ended December 31, 2015. Refer to Note 25. \"Matters Related to the Bankruptcy of Patriot Coal Corporation\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information surrounding these risks.\nAdditionally, we are a party to proceedings alleging we have withdrawal liability of $644.2 million to the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan, which is discussed in Note 25. \"Matters Related to the Bankruptcy of Patriot Coal Corporation\". Other parties may make claims against us in relation to Patriot's bankruptcy, although we are unaware of any other claims at this time.\nOur expenditures for postretirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nWe provide postretirement health and life insurance benefits to eligible employees. Our total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation related to such benefits was a liability of $776.1 million as of December 31, 2015, of which $53.2 million was classified as a current liability. Certain of our U.S. subsidiaries also sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Net pension liabilities were $182.0 million as of December 31, 2015, of which $1.6 million was classified a current liability.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nThese liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, future cost trends, and rates of return on plan assets to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. A decrease in the discount rate used to determine our postretirement benefit and defined benefit pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of these obligations, thereby increasing the cost in subsequent fiscal years. We have made assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes or changes in healthcare benefits provided by the government could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Additionally, our reported defined benefit pension funding status may be affected, and we may be required to increase employer contributions, due to increases in our defined benefit pension obligation or poor financial performance in asset markets in future years.\nOur defined benefit pension plans are subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). It is implicit in our underlying assumptions that those plans continue to operate in the normal course of business. However, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) may terminate our plans under certain circumstances pursuant to ERISA laws, including in the event that the PBGC concludes that its risk may increase unreasonably if such plans continue to operate based on its assessment of the plans\u2019 funded status, our financial condition or other factors. Termination of the plans would require us to provide immediate funding or other financial assurance to the PBGC for all or a substantial portion of the underfunded amounts, as determined by the PBGC based on its own assumptions. Those assumptions may differ from our own. Any of those consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial conditions or available liquidity.\nOur common stock could be delisted or be suspended from trading.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In order for our common stock to continue to be listed on the NYSE, we are required to comply with various quantitative and qualitative listing standards. A renewed or continued decline in the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE could result in a breach of these requirements. If we were not able to cure the breach, the NYSE could commence suspension or delisting procedures in respect of our common stock. The commencement of suspension or delisting procedures by an exchange remains, at all times, at the discretion of such exchange and would be publicly announced by the exchange.\nIf a suspension or delisting were to occur, there would be significantly less liquidity in the suspended or delisted securities. In addition, our ability to raise capital and compensate personnel by means of share-based compensation would be greatly impaired. Furthermore, with respect to any suspended or delisted securities, we would expect decreases in institutional and other investor demand, analyst coverage, market making activity and information available concerning trading prices and volume, and fewer broker-dealers would be willing to execute trades with respect to such securities. A suspension or delisting would likely decrease the attractiveness of our common stock to investors and cause the trading volume of our common stock to decline, which could result in a further decline in the market price of our common stock.\nConcerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion, including perceived impacts on global climate issues, are resulting in increased regulation of coal combustion in many jurisdictions, unfavorable lending policies by government-backed lending institutions and development banks toward the financing of new overseas coal-fueled power plants and divestment efforts affecting the investment community, which could significantly affect demand for our products or our securities.\nGlobal climate issues continue to attract public and scientific attention. Numerous reports, such as the Fourth (and, more recently, the Fifth) Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have also engendered concern about the impacts of human activity, especially fossil fuel combustion, on global climate issues. In turn, increasing government attention is being paid to global climate issues and to emissions of what are commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, including emissions of carbon dioxide from coal combustion by power plants.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2015 Form 10-K\nEnactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S., some of its states or other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources or coal-fueled power plant closures. Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants could adversely impact the global demand for coal in the future. The potential financial impact on us of future laws, regulations or other policies will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws, regulations or other policies, the time periods over which those laws, regulations or other policies would be phased in, the state of commercial development and deployment of CCS technologies and the alternative markets for coal. From time to time, we attempt to analyze the potential impact on the Company of as-yet-unadopted potential laws, regulations and policies. Such analyses require that we make significant assumptions as to the specific provisions of such potential laws, regulations and policies. These analyses sometimes show that certain potential laws, regulations and policies, if implemented in the manner assumed by the analyses, could result in material adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow, in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these potential laws, regulations and policies. We do not believe that such analyses reasonably predict the quantitative impact that future laws, regulations or other policies may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThere have also been efforts in recent years affecting the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities and also pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. The impact of such efforts may adversely affect the demand for and price of securities issued by us, and impact our access to the capital and financial markets.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions that may discourage a takeover attempt.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our by-laws and certificate of incorporation impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nDiversity in interpretation and application of accounting literature in the mining industry may impact our reported financial results.\nThe mining industry has limited industry-specific accounting literature and, as a result, we understand diversity in practice exists in the interpretation and application of accounting literature to mining-specific issues. As diversity in mining industry accounting is addressed, we may need to restate our reported results if the resulting interpretations differ from our current accounting practices.
