{"cik": "731012", "company": "HEALTHCARE SERVICES GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors we have described below, as well as other related information contained within this annual report on Form 10-K as these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We believe that the risks described below are our most significant risk factors but there may be risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial.\nWe provide services to several clients which contribute significantly, on an individual as well as an aggregate basis, to our total revenues.\nGenesis contributed 15.6% and 19.3% of our total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Although we expect to continue the relationship with Genesis, there can be no assurance thereof. The loss of Genesis as a client, or a significant reduction in the revenues we receive from Genesis, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of our two operating segments and the Company. In addition, if Genesis fails to abide by current payment terms it could increase our accounts receivable balance and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows.\nOur clients are concentrated in the healthcare industry, which is subject to changes in government regulation. Many of our clients rely on reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors. Rates from such payors may be altered or reduced, thus affecting our clients\u2019 results of operations and cash flows.\nWe provide our services primarily to providers of long-term and post-acute care. We cannot predict what efforts, and to what extent, legislation and proposals to contain healthcare costs will ultimately impact our clients\u2019 revenues through reimbursement rate modifications. Congress has enacted a number of laws during the past decade that have significantly altered, and may continue to alter, overall government reimbursement for nursing home services. Because many of our clients\u2019 revenues are highly reliant on Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement funding rates and mechanisms, the overall effect of these laws and trends in the long-term care industry have affected and could adversely affect our clients\u2019 cash flows, resulting in their inability to make payments to us on agreed upon payment terms. These factors, in addition to delays in payments from clients have resulted in, and could continue to result in, significant additional bad debts in the future.\nChanges to federal healthcare legislation may adversely affect our operating costs and results of operations.\nContinued changes to the healthcare structure and regulations related to the health insurance industry in the United States could impact our operating costs. Any requirements to provide additional benefits to our employees or the payment of penalties if such benefits are not provided, would increase our expenses. If we are unable to pass-through these charges to our clients to cover these expenses, such increases could adversely impact our operating costs and our results of operations.\nIn addition, often new regulations result in additional reporting requirements for businesses. These and other requirements could result in increased costs, expanded liability exposure, and other changes in the way we provide healthcare insurance and other benefits to our employees.\nStates in which our clients are located could experience significant budget deficits and such deficits may result in reduction of reimbursements to nursing homes.\nStates in which our clients are located could have budget deficits as a result of lower than projected revenue collections and increased demand for the funding of entitlements. As a result of these and other adverse economic factors, state Medicaid programs have and may revise reimbursement structures for nursing home services. Any disruption or delay in the distribution of Medicaid and related payments to our clients will adversely affect their cash flows and impact their ability to pay us as agreed upon for the services provided.\nThe Company has substantial investment in the creditworthiness and financial condition of our customers.\nThe largest current asset on our balance sheet is the accounts and notes receivable balance from our customers. We grant credit to substantially all of our customers. Deterioration in the financial condition of a significant component of our customer base could hinder our ability to collect amounts due from our customers. Potential causes of such declines include national or local economic downturns, customers\u2019 dependence on continued Medicare and Medicaid funding and the impact of additional regulatory actions.\nWe have sometimes extended the period of payment for certain clients beyond contractual terms. Such clients include those who have terminated service agreements and slow payers experiencing financial difficulties. In order to provide for such collection issues and the general risk associated with the granting of credit terms, we have recorded bad debt provisions (in an Allowance for Doubtful Accounts) of $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $51.4 million and $6.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In making our credit evaluations, in addition to analyzing and anticipating, where possible, the specific cases described above, we consider the general collection risk associated with trends in the long-term care industry. We establish credit limits through our payment terms, perform ongoing credit evaluations and monitor accounts to minimize the risk of loss. Despite our efforts to minimize credit risk exposure, clients could be adversely affected if future industry trends change in such a manner as to negatively impact their cash flows. If our clients experience a negative impact on their cash flows, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have a Paid Loss Retrospective Insurance Plan for general liability and workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\nWe carry a high deductible general liability and workers\u2019 compensation program and therefore retain a substantial portion of the risk associated with the possible losses under such programs. Under our insurance plans for general liability and workers\u2019 compensation, predetermined loss limits are arranged with our insurance company to limit both our per occurrence cash outlay and annual insurance plan cost. We regularly evaluate our claims pay-out experience and other factors related to the nature of specific claims in arriving at the basis for our accrued insurance claims estimate. Our evaluation is based primarily on current information derived from reviewing our claims experience and industry trends. In the event that our known claims experience and/or industry trends result in an unfavorable change in initial estimates of costs to settle such claims resulting from, among other factors, the severity levels of reported claims and medical cost inflation, it would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Although we engage third-party experts to assist us in estimating appropriate reserves, the determination of the required reserves is dependent upon significant actuarial judgments. Changes in our insurance reserves as a result of our periodic evaluation of the related liabilities may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results.\nFederal, state and local tax rules can adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the United States. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. We believe our income tax estimates are reasonable. Although, if the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority disagrees on a tax position we\u2019ve taken and upon final adjudication we are required to change such position, we could incur additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. Such costs and expenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the taxability of our services is subject to various interpretations within the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. Consequently, in the ordinary course of business, a jurisdiction may contest our reporting positions with respect to the application of its tax code to our services. A conflicting position taken by a state or local taxation authority on the taxability of our services could result in additional tax liabilities and could negatively impact our competitive position in that jurisdiction. If we fail to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties in addition to the delinquent tax assessment. In the taxing jurisdictions where our services have been determined to be subject to tax, the jurisdiction may increase the tax rate assessed on such services. We seek to pass-through to our clients such tax increases. In the event we are not able to pass-through any portion of the tax increase, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by unfavorable results of material litigation or governmental inquiries.\nIn addition to the SEC investigation and class action lawsuit, we are currently involved in civil litigation and government inquiries which arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters relate to, among other things, general liability, payroll or employee-related matters. Legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages and expenses and may adversely affect our reputation and business status with our clients, whether or not we are ultimately determined to be liable. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action and collective action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. The plaintiffs in these types of actions may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and estimates may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nWe assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual in our financial statements. We would accrue an estimated loss contingency in our financial statements if it were probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of the loss could be reasonably estimated. Due to the unpredictable nature of litigation, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The amount of actual losses may differ from our current assessment. As a result of the costs and expenses of defending ourselves against lawsuits or claims, and risks and consequences of legal actions, regardless of merit, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected or cause variability in our results compared to expectations.\nA significant majority of our customer base are multi-facility management groups and independent facility operators who lease the buildings in which they operate and may experience risks relating to their leases including termination, escalators, extensions and special charges.\nThe credit worthiness of our existing clients, and potential clients, is impacted by their ability to maintain positive relationships with their respective landlords. Any loss or deterioration in the relationship between our clients and their respective landlords may adversely affect their financial condition and ability to make payments on their service agreement with us on agreed upon terms. Any failure by our clients to make rent payments or comply with the provisions of their lease terms could result in the termination of such lease agreements. In such cases, our clients may lose their ability to continue conducting operations and as a result terminate their service agreements with us.\nWe primarily provide our services pursuant to agreements which have a one year term, cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice after an initial 60 to 120 day service agreement period.\nWe do not enter into long-term contractual agreements with our clients for the rendering of our services. Our agreements with clients typically provide for a renewable one year service term, cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice after an initial period of 60 to 120 days. Consequently, our clients can unilaterally decrease the amount of services we provide or terminate all services pursuant to the terms of our service agreements. Although we have historically had a favorable client retention rate and expect to continue to maintain satisfactory relationships with our clients, in the event the Company were to lose a significant number of clients, such loss could in the aggregate materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s business success depends on the management experience of our key personnel.\nWe manage and provide our services through a network of management personnel, from on-site facility managers to our executive officers. Therefore, we believe that our ability to recruit and sustain the internal development of managerial personnel is an important factor impacting future operating results and our ability to successfully execute projected growth strategies. Our professional management personnel are the key personnel in maintaining current and selling additional services to existing clients and obtaining new clients.\nGovernmental regulations related to labor, employment, immigration and health and safety could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations in areas such as labor, employment, immigration, and health and safety. These laws frequently evolve through case law, legislative changes and changes in regulatory interpretation, implementation and enforcement. Our policies and procedures and compliance programs are subject to adjustments in response to these changing regulatory and enforcement environments, which could increase our cost of services provided. Although we have contractual rights to pass through cost increases we incur to our clients due to regulatory changes, our delay in, or inability to pass such costs through to our clients, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws, we may be subject to lawsuits, investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, penalties, damages, reimbursements, or injunctions. Also, our clients\u2019 facilities are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state, and local authorities for compliance with state and local departments of health requirements. Expenses resulting from failed inspections of the departments that we service could result in our clients being fined and seeking recovery from us, which could also adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by inflationary or market fluctuations, including impact of tariffs, in the cost of products consumed in providing our services or our cost of labor. Additionally, we rely on certain vendors for housekeeping, laundry and dietary supplies.\nThe prices we pay for the principal items we consume in performing our services are dependent primarily on current market prices. We have consolidated certain supply purchases with national vendors through agreements containing negotiated prospective pricing. In the event such vendors are not able to comply with their obligations under the agreements and we are required to seek alternative suppliers, we may incur increased costs of supplies.\nDietary supplies, to a much greater extent than Housekeeping supplies, are impacted by commodity pricing factors, including the impact of tariffs, which in many cases are unpredictable and outside of our control. We seek to pass on to clients such increased costs but sometimes we are unable to do so. Even when we are able to pass on such costs to our clients, from time to time, sporadic unanticipated increases in the costs of certain supply items due to market or economic conditions may result in a timing delay in passing on such increases to our clients. It is this type of spike in Dietary supplies costs that could most adversely affect Dietary\u2019s operating performance. The adverse effect would be realized if we delay in passing on such costs to our clients or in instances where we may not be able to pass such increase on to our clients until the time of our next scheduled service billing review. We seek to mitigate the impact of an unanticipated increase in such supplies\u2019 costs through consolidation of vendors, which increases our ability to obtain more favorable pricing.\nOur cost of labor may be influenced by factors in certain market areas or changes in the respective collective bargaining agreements to which we are a party. A substantial number of our employees are hourly employees whose wage rates are affected by increases in the federal or state minimum wage rates, wage inflation or local job market adjustments. As collective bargaining agreements are renegotiated, we may need to increase the wages paid to bargaining unit employees covered by such collective bargaining agreements. Although we have contractual rights to pass such union and minimum wage increases through to our clients, our delay in, or inability to pass such wage increases through to our clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn fiscal 2019, one distributor distributed approximately 50% of our food and non-food dining supplies, and if our relationship or their business were to be disrupted, we could experience disruptions to our operations and cost structure.\nAlthough we negotiate the pricing and other terms for the majority of our purchases of food and dining supplies directly with national manufacturers, we procure these products and other items through Sysco Corporation. Sysco, is responsible for tracking our orders and delivering products to our specific locations. If our relationship with, or the business of, Sysco were to be disrupted, we would have to arrange alternative distributors and our operations and cost structure could be adversely affected in the short term.\nAny perceived or real health risks related to the food industry could adversely affect our Dietary segment.\nWe are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally including food spoilage and food contamination. Our products are susceptible to contamination by disease-producing organisms, or pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, campylobacter, hepatitis A, trichinosis and generic E. coli. Because these pathogens are generally found in the environment, there is a risk that these pathogens could be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the manufacturing, processing or food service level. Our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities and products are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to health, food preparation, sanitation and safety standards. Difficulties or failures by these companies in obtaining any required licenses or approvals or otherwise complying with such laws and regulations could disrupt their operations which could adversely affect our operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that compliance with governmental regulations by our suppliers will eliminate the risks related to food safety. To the extent there is an outbreak of food related illness in any of our client facilities, it could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the Company may be subject to liability if the consumption of our food products causes injury, illness or death. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused injury or illness could adversely affect our reputation.\nChanges in interest rates and changes in financial market conditions may result in fluctuating and even negative returns in our investments, and could increase the cost of the borrowings under our borrowing agreements.\nAlthough management believes we have a prudent investment policy, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and in the market value of our investment portfolio which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Our marketable securities consist of municipal bonds. We believe that our investment criteria, which include diversification among issuers of bonds, requirements regarding credit ratings and monitoring of our investments\u2019 duration periods, reduce our exposure related to the financial distress and budget shortfalls that many state and local governments currently face. Increases in market interest rates could adversely affect our payment obligations with respect to our variable-rate borrowing agreements and adversely affect our liquidity and earnings.\nInvestor and market expectations regarding our financial performance are high and rely greatly on execution of our growth strategy and related increases in financial performance.\nThe historical performance of our Common Stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Our business strategy focuses on growth and improving profitability through obtaining service agreements with new clients, providing new services to existing clients, obtaining modest price increases on service agreements with clients and maintaining internal cost reduction strategies at our various operational levels. With respect to providing new services to new or existing clients, our strategy is to achieve corresponding profit margins in each of our segments. If we are unable to continue either historical client revenue and profitability growth rates or projected improvement, our operating performance may be adversely affected and the high expectations for our market performance may not be met. Any failure to meet the market\u2019s high expectations for our revenue and operating results may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation into our earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) calculation practices could result in potential sanctions or penalties, distraction to our management and result in litigation from third parties, each of which could adversely affect or cause variability in our financial results.\nBeginning in November 2017, the Company has been in dialogue with the SEC regarding EPS calculation, rounding and reporting practices and in March 2018 we learned that the SEC had opened a formal investigation into these matters. In response to the SEC\u2019s investigation, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company authorized its outside counsel to conduct an internal investigation, under the direction of the Company\u2019s Audit Committee regarding these matters. The internal investigation was completed in March 2019 and prior to the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nNotwithstanding the completion of the internal investigation, the SEC\u2019s investigation is ongoing and there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulatory body will not make further regulatory inquiries or pursue further action that could result in significant costs and expenses including potential sanctions or penalties as well as distraction to management. The ongoing SEC investigation and/or any related litigation could adversely affect or cause variability in our financial results.\nOn March 22, 2019, a putative shareholder class action lawsuit alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed against the Company and our Chief Executive Officer in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in connection with the matters related to the SEC investigation. The class action complaint was amended on September 17, 2019. Please refer to \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and \u201cNote 17-Other Contingencies \u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information. We cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuit, the magnitude of any potential losses or the effect such litigation may have on us or our operations. Regardless of the outcome, lawsuits and investigations involving us, or our current or former officers and directors, could result in significant expenses and divert attention and resources of our management and other key employees. We could be required to pay damages or other penalties or have injunctions or other equitable remedies imposed against us or our current or former directors and officers including any obligation to indemnify our current and former directors and officers in connection with lawsuits, governmental investigations and related litigation or settlement amounts. Such amounts could exceed the coverage provided under our insurance policies. Any of these factors could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the Company may be subject to further litigation from third parties related to the matters under review by the SEC.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis.\nFailure to maintain appropriate and effective internal controls over our financial reporting could result in misstatements in our financial statements and potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and could cause us to delay the filing of required reports with the SEC and our reporting of financial results. Any of these events could result in a decline in the market price of our Common Stock. Although we have taken steps to maintain our internal control structure as required, we cannot guarantee that control deficiencies will not result in a misstatement in the future.\nAny decrease in or suspension of our dividend could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend. However, our dividend policy and the payment of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including the impact of changing laws and regulations, economic conditions, our results of operations and/or financial condition, capital resources, financial covenants under our credit facility and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. While we have continually increased the amount of our dividends, given these considerations, there can be no assurance these increases will continue and our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of the payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.\nCyber-attacks and breaches could cause operational disruptions, fraud or theft of sensitive information.\nAspects of our operations are reliant upon internet-based activities, such as ordering supplies and back-office functions such as accounting and transaction processing, making and accepting payments, processing payroll and other administrative functions, etc. A significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems may have a significant impact on our operations, potentially resulting in service interruptions, security violations, regulatory compliance failures and other operational difficulties. In addition, any attack perpetrated against our information systems including through a system failure, security breach or disruption by malware or other damage, could similarly impact our operations and result in loss or misuse of information, litigation and potential liability. Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate the risks presented by potential cyber incidents, it is not possible to protect against every potential power loss, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack or similar event that may arise. Moreover, the safeguards we use are subject to human implementation and maintenance and to other uncertainties. Any of these cyber incidents may result in a violation of applicable laws or regulations (including privacy and other laws), damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers and give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. Such events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nShareholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our board of directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our shareholders. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of a proxy contest or matters arising from a proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.", "PERMNO": 41292, "SIC": 7340, "TIC": "HCSG"}
