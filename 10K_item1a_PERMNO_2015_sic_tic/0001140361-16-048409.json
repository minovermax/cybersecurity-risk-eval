{"cik": "1030206", "company": "VASCULAR SOLUTIONS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-01-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nWe will not be successful if the interventional medical device community does not adopt our new products or services.\nWe have launched over 100 new products or services since our inception. Our success will depend on the continued launch of new products and services and the medical community\u2019s acceptance of our new products and services. We cannot predict how quickly, if at all, the medical community will accept our new products and services, or, if accepted, the continuation or extent of their use. Our potential customers must:\n\u00b7 believe that our products or services offer benefits compared to the methodologies and/or devices that they are currently using;\n\u00b7 use our products or services and obtain acceptable clinical outcomes;\n\u00b7 believe that our products or services are worth the price that they will be asked to pay; and\n\u00b7 be willing to commit the time and resources required to change their current methodology.\nBecause we are often selling a new technology, we have limited ability to predict the level of growth or timing of sales of these products or services. If we encounter difficulties in growing our sales of our new medical devices or services, our business will be seriously harmed.\nWe and our Chief Executive Officer are defendants in a criminal indictment that could result in a substantial disruption to our business.\nThe products and business activities of medical device companies are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and international governmental authorities under statutes and regulations governing health care fraud. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices have increased their scrutiny over the medical device industry in recent years. The U.S. Congress, Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Defense have all issued subpoenas and other requests for information to conduct investigations of, and commenced civil and criminal litigation against, medical device manufacturers, primarily related to financial arrangements with health care providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices.\nDuring 2012, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Texas intervened in a qui tam civil lawsuit initiated against us involving allegations of off-label promotion of our Vari-Lase Short Kit endovenous laser product (see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings: Government Litigation of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015). Subsequently, we learned that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office also had commenced a criminal investigation of the same matter. On January 22, 2014, we agreed with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to settle the civil lawsuit, and the settlement agreement was executed on July 28, 2014. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we made a payment of $520,000, we made no admission of fault or liability, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office dismissed the civil lawsuit with prejudice and released all civil claims brought against us in the civil lawsuit.\nSettlement of the civil lawsuit had no effect upon the criminal investigation, and on November 13, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a criminal indictment in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas related to the Vari-Lase Short Kit investigation. The original indictment alleged that we and our Chief Executive Officer introduced adulterated and misbranded medical devices into interstate commerce and conspired to introduce adulterated and misbranded medical devices into interstate commerce through the alleged off-label promotion of the Vari-Lase Short Kit product. On December 2, 2015, a superseding indictment was issued that removed the allegations related to introducing adulterated medical devices. We believe the remaining allegations are false and are contesting them vigorously.\nA trial on the indictment is scheduled to commence on February 1, 2016 in San Antonio, Texas. Continuing to defend ourselves against the indictment entails costs that are material and requires significant attention from our management. If we were to be convicted of the crimes alleged in the indictment, remedies could include fines, penalties, forfeitures and compliance conditions. We cannot estimate the amount or range of loss if we were to be convicted; however, it would likely be material. If we were to be convicted of a crime related to the delivery of an item or service under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, or a felony related to health care fraud, we would become automatically excluded by the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) from participation in U.S. government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. If we were to be convicted of a misdemeanor related to health care fraud, we could be immediately excluded by HHS from participation in U.S. government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Exclusion from participation in U.S. government health care programs would substantially prevent us from continuing to sell our products in the U.S., and thereby would seriously damage our business. Conviction of our Chief Executive Officer of a crime under statutes related to misbranding and health care fraud could require the termination of his employment with us. The consequences of the current criminal litigation, as well as consequences of any future governmental investigation or lawsuit of any related or unrelated matter, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and stock price.\nWe may become subject to shareholder litigation, which could divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operation of our business or result in us incurring substantial costs and liabilities.\nFollowing the announcement on November 13, 2014 of the criminal indictment of Vascular Solutions and our Chief Executive Officer, several law firms publicly stated that they were conducting investigations of us or our officers and directors for potential securities law and shareholder derivative action lawsuits. Such investigations often result in litigation. Although no securities law or shareholder derivative action lawsuit has been filed against the Company to date, such a lawsuit may be filed in the future. If securities or shareholder derivative litigation were to be commenced against us, our defense of such litigation could divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operation of our business or result in us incurring substantial costs and liabilities, irrespective of the merits of the litigation.\nWe may face intellectual property litigation, which could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or services or result in us incurring substantial costs and liabilities.\nThe interventional medical device industry is characterized by numerous patent filings. As a result, participants in the industry frequently experience substantial intellectual property litigation. While we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation, in the recent past we have been involved in litigation concerning multiple products.\nSome companies in the interventional medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage. In addition, non-practicing patent assertion entities have accumulated patent rights related to the medical device industry and are asserting them against operating companies in attempt to collect settlements or licensing fees. Intellectual property litigation has proven to be very complex, and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict. While we do not believe that any of our products or services infringe any existing patent or other intellectual property right, we previously have been involved in substantial intellectual property litigation and expect to continue to become subject to intellectual property claims with respect to our new or existing products or services.\nAn adverse determination in any intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings against us could prohibit us from selling a product or service, subject us to significant immediate payments to third parties and require us to seek licenses from third parties. The costs associated with these license arrangements may be substantial and could include substantial up-front payments and ongoing royalties. Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a product or service.\nOur involvement in any future intellectual property claims, regardless of the merits of any asserted claim against us, could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel away from the development and marketing of our products and services for significant periods of time. Furthermore, the penalties involved with an adverse outcome may be severe, and the costs incurred related to defending such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, even if we ultimately prevail in them.\nOur future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe ongoing introduction of new products and services that affect our overall product mix make the prediction of future operating results difficult. You should not rely on our past revenue growth as any indication of future growth rates or operating results. The price of our common stock will likely fall in the event that our operating results do not meet the expectations of analysts and investors. Comparisons of our operating results between quarters are an unreliable indication of our future performance because they are likely to vary significantly based on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the level of sales of our products and services in our markets;\n\u00b7 our ability to introduce new products or services and enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u00b7 the demand for, and acceptance of, our products and services;\n\u00b7 the success of our competition and the introduction of alternative products or services;\n\u00b7 our ability to command favorable pricing for our products and services;\n\u00b7 the growth of the market for our products and services;\n\u00b7 the expansion and rate of success of our direct sales force in the United States and our independent distributors internationally;\n\u00b7 actions relating to ongoing FDA compliance;\n\u00b7 the effects of intellectual property disputes;\n\u00b7 the effects of government investigations and litigation;\n\u00b7 the size and timing of orders from independent distributors or customers;\n\u00b7 the attraction and retention of key personnel, particularly in sales and marketing, regulatory, manufacturing and research and development;\n\u00b7 unanticipated delays or an inability to control costs;\n\u00b7 general economic conditions, as well as those specific to our customers and markets; and\n\u00b7 seasonal fluctuations in revenue due to the elective nature of some procedures.\nWe may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities.\nThe manufacture and sale of medical products entails significant risk of product liability claims. Any product liability claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, reduced sales, cause us to incur significant liabilities and divert our management\u2019s time, attention and resources. We cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe market for interventional medical devices and services is highly competitive and will likely become more competitive, and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products or services obsolete.\nThe existing market for interventional medical devices and services is intensely competitive. We expect competition to increase further as companies develop new products and services or modify their existing products and services to compete directly with ours. Each of our products and services encounters competition from several medical device companies, including Medtronic plc., Boston Scientific Corporation, Terumo Corporation, and Cook Medical Inc., the Abbott Vascular division of Abbott Laboratories, and Asahi Intecc Co., Ltd. Each of these companies has:\n\u00b7 better name recognition;\n\u00b7 broader product lines;\n\u00b7 greater sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u00b7 significantly greater financial resources;\n\u00b7 larger research and development staffs and facilities; and\n\u00b7 existing relationships with some of our potential customers.\nWe may not be able to effectively compete with these companies. In addition, broad product lines may allow our competitors to negotiate exclusive, long-term supply contracts and offer comprehensive pricing for their products or services. Broader product lines may also provide our competitors with a significant advantage in marketing competing products or services to group purchasing organizations and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralized purchasing. Greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products or services obsolete.\nWe rely on continued development and improvement of our products and service, which if not successful, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are continually engaged in developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. New or improved products and services represent a significant component of our sales growth. We dedicate significant financial and managerial resources to product and services development and improvement. We may not achieve our development objectives within our schedule and budget, or at all, due to technical or operational challenges. Failure to achieve our development objectives on schedule may increase our development expenses and adversely impact our revenues. If we do achieve our development objectives, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new or improved products or services, and we may not be successful in marketing and selling such products or services. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or successfully market and sell new or improved products and services could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations.\nConstraints or interruption in production from any of our key suppliers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the interest of operational efficiency and due to quality considerations, we obtain some of the components for the products that we manufacture from a sole source. If the availability of components from a sole source of supply is constrained or interrupted, there is no assurance that we could find an alternative source of supply quickly and cost effectively, if at all. In addition, due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and equivalent regulatory entities regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials. Unavailability of components could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and sell products and our results of operations.\nWe also distribute finished products that are available only from their manufacturer. In addition, the reprocessing services that we offer are performed by a single provider. Operational, quality or regulatory issues of the manufacturers of the products we distribute, or the provider of our reprocessing services, could constrain or interrupt the availability of those products or services. Any constraint or interruption in supply of finished products that we distribute, or the reprocessing services that we offer, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell products and services to customers, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nOur international sales are subject to a number of risks that could seriously harm our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services in any international market.\nOur international sales are subject to several risks, including:\n\u00b7 the ability of our independent distributors to sell our products and services;\n\u00b7 the impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;\n\u00b7 greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs or other trade barriers;\n\u00b7 potential exposure to legal liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws for the action of our international business associates;\n\u00b7 weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u00b7 political and economic instability.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm our future international sales and our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services in any international market.\nWe depend on information technology and communications systems to operate our business and unauthorized access to, or breaches or other failures of, these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations and for communication with our direct domestic sales force. Our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and protect the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary data. Third-party cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. Any successful cyber-attack against us could result in the theft of intellectual property, misappropriation of employee or customer information or of our other assets, and disruption of our communication with our direct domestic sales force, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. If we fail to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could be subject to increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business and results of operations may be seriously harmed by changes in third-party reimbursement policies and healthcare industry cost-containment measures.\nWe could be seriously harmed by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payors, particularly to the extent any changes affect reimbursement for catheterization procedures in which our products or services are used. Failure by physicians, hospitals and other users of our products or services to obtain sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payors for procedures in which our products or services are used, or adverse changes in governmental and private third-party payors\u2019 policies toward reimbursement for such procedures, would seriously harm our business.\nIn the United States, healthcare providers, including hospitals and clinics that purchase medical devices or services such as our products and services, generally rely on third-party payors, principally federal Medicare, state Medicaid and private health insurance plans, to reimburse all or part of the cost of catheterization procedures. Any changes in this reimbursement system could seriously harm our business.\nIn an effort to reduce costs, many existing and potential customers for our products in the United States have become members of group purchasing organization (GPOs) and integrated delivery networks (IDNs). GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with medical device manufacturers and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. GPOs and IDNs typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. Bids generally are solicited from multiple manufacturers with the intention of driving down pricing. The increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products, thereby reducing our profitability.\nIn international markets, acceptance of our products and services is dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country. Our failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have a negative impact on market acceptance of our products and services in the markets in which these approvals are sought.\nOur products and services and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could prevent us from selling our products or services in the United States or introducing new and improved products or services.\nOur products and services and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including the FDA and comparable international agencies. We are required to:\n\u00b7 obtain the clearance of the FDA and international agencies before we can market and sell our products and services;\n\u00b7 satisfy these agencies\u2019 content requirements for all of our labeling, sales and promotional materials; and\n\u00b7 undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies.\nCompliance with the regulations of these agencies may delay or prevent us from introducing any new model of our existing products or other new products or services. Furthermore, we may be subject to sanctions, including temporary or permanent suspension of operations, product recalls and marketing restrictions if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business.\nWe are also required to demonstrate compliance with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations. The FDA enforces its quality system regulations through pre-approval and periodic post-approval inspections. These regulations relate to product testing, vendor qualification, design control and quality assurance, as well as the maintenance of records and documentation. If we are unable to conform to these regulations, the FDA may take actions which could seriously harm our business. In addition, government regulation may be established that could prevent, delay, modify or rescind regulatory clearance or approval of our products or services.\nOur industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur products and business activities are subject to rigorous regulation, including by the U.S. FDA, Department of Justice, and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities have been increasing scrutiny of our industry and enforcement actions related to companies in it. In addition, certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation that requires disclosure of certain of our interactions with health care providers. As a result, we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to health care providers licensed by certain states and to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the federal level. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement policies, systems, and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business. We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.", "PERMNO": 88475, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "VASC"}
