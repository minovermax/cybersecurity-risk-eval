{"cik": "1056285", "company": "KIRKLAND'S, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes before investing in our common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial. We can provide no assurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts, although we believe they are reasonable, will be successful.\nRisks Related to Strategy and Strategy Execution\nIf we fail to identify, develop and successfully implement immediate action plans and longer-term strategic initiatives, our financial performance could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to address the challenges currently facing the business and to deliver improved financial performance is dependent on successfully identifying, developing and implementing plans and initiatives intended to drive near-term improvement and to return the business to sustainable financial performance, including, but not limited to, our efforts to right size our store base. If such plans and initiatives are not properly identified, developed and successfully executed, or if execution or realization of positive results takes longer than expected, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If we continue to incur losses, additional actions will be required to address our long-term financial performance. The success of our plans and initiatives is subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to execution, market conditions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially, and adversely, from our plans and expected results.\nIf we are unable to successfully maintain, improve and grow a best-in-class omni-channel experience for our customers, it could adversely affect our sales, results of operations and reputation.\nAs consumers continue to migrate online, we face pressures to stay relevant in retail\u2019s ever-changing environment and to compete with other omni-channel retailers, online only retailers and brick-and-mortar retailers. We continue to significantly invest in our omni-channel capabilities to provide a seamless shopping experience between our brick-and-mortar locations and our online and mobile environments. Insufficient, untimely or misguided investments in this area could significantly impact our profitability and growth and affect our ability to attract new customers, as well as maintain our existing ones. In addition, declining customer store traffic and migration of sales from brick-and-mortar stores to digital platforms could lead to additional store closures, restructuring and other costs that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business has evolved from an in-store experience to interactions with customers across multiple channels (in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others). Our customers are using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop on our website and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments and technology investments by our competitors.\nSuccessful operation of our e-commerce initiatives are dependent on our ability to maintain uninterrupted availability of the Company\u2019s website and supporting applications, adequate and accurate inventory levels, timely fulfillment of customer orders, accurate shipping of undamaged products, and coordination of those activities within our retail stores when appropriate. In addition, the Company\u2019s call center must maintain a high standard of customer care. Failure to successfully manage this process may negatively impact sales, result in the loss of customers, and damage our reputation.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support our omni-channel efforts, implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our customers, regardless of the ultimate sales channel, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if www.kirklands.com and our other customer-facing technology systems do not appeal to our customers or reliably function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, which, if significant, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to profitably operate our existing stores, grow online sales and effectively execute our store closing strategy, we may not be able to execute our business strategy, resulting in a decrease in net sales and profitability.\nA key element of our strategy is to operate and relocate profitable stores, both in existing markets and in new geographic markets that we select based on customer data and demographics. Our ability to relocate existing stores depends on a number of factors, including the prevailing conditions in the commercial real estate market, our ability to locate favorable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms, and hire and train skilled managers and personnel. There also can be no assurance that we will be able to open or relocate stores. Furthermore, there is no assurance that existing stores will generate the net sales levels necessary to achieve store-level profitability. Also, stores that we open in our existing markets may draw customers away from our existing stores resulting in lower net sales growth compared to stores opened in new markets.\nOur stores face great competition and could have lower than anticipated net sales volumes. Traffic decline to our stores could negatively impact operating results. Our newer stores that we opened in new markets, where we are less well-known and where we are less familiar with the target customer, may face different or additional risks and increased marketing and other costs compared to stores operated in existing markets. These factors, together with increased pre-opening expenses at our newer stores, may reduce our average store contribution and operating margins. If we are unable to profitably operate our newer stores and maintain the profitability of our existing stores, our net income could suffer.\nEvery year we decide to close certain stores based on a number of factors, including but not limited to excessive rent or other operating cost increases, inadequate profitability, short term leases, or the landlord\u2019s ability to replace us with another tenant at more favorable terms to the landlord. Store closings have the effect of reducing net sales. We may choose to close under-performing stores before lease expiration and incur termination costs associated with those closings. If we are not able to increase online sales at a pace that exceeds the closing of existing under-performing stores, or transfer customers from closing stores to a nearby existing store, our revenue could decrease.\nWe closed 27 stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, if our closing strategy, including negotiating lease termination costs with landlords, does not go as planned and/or we are unable to transfer these existing store customers to other nearby stores or to online sales, our revenue could decrease and results of operations could suffer.\nWe may not be able to successfully anticipate consumer trends, and our failure to do so may lead to loss of consumer acceptance of our products, resulting in reduced net sales.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer demands in a timely manner. While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, consumer spending patterns and preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. Our product introductions and product improvements, along with our other marketplace initiatives, are designed to capitalize on consumer trends. In order to remain successful, we must anticipate and react to these trends and develop new products or processes to address them. If we fail to identify and respond to emerging trends, consumer acceptance of the merchandise in our stores and our image with our customers may be harmed, which could reduce customer traffic in our stores and materially adversely affect our net sales.\nAdditionally, if we misjudge market trends, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit and cash flow. Conversely, shortages of items that prove popular could reduce our net sales. In addition, a major shift in consumer demand away from home d\u00e9cor could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends upon our marketing, advertising and promotional efforts, and loyalty programs. If we are unable to implement them successfully, or if our competitors market, advertise or promote more effectively than we do, our revenue may be adversely affected.\nWe use marketing, promotional and loyalty programs to attract customers to our stores and to encourage purchases by our customers. We use various media for our promotional efforts, including customer-targeted direct mail and email communications, as well as various digital and social media initiatives. If we fail to choose the appropriate medium for our efforts, or fail to implement and execute loyalty programs or marketing opportunities, our competitors may be able to attract some of our customers.\nIf our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, if our loyalty program or advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A failure to sufficiently innovate, develop customer loyalty programs, or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales.\nWe may not be able to successfully respond to technological change, our website could become obsolete and our financial results and conditions could be adversely affected.\nWe maintain a corporate website through which we market and sell our products to customers and publicize Company information to customers, investors and other constituencies. Maintenance of our website requires substantial development and maintenance efforts, and entails significant technical and business risks. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our website. The sale of products through e-commerce is characterized by rapid technological change, the emergence of new industry standards and practices and changes in customer requirements and preferences. Therefore, we may be required to license emerging technologies, enhance our existing website, develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers, and adapt to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our ability to remain technologically competitive may require substantial expenditures and lead time, and our failure to do so may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain a positive social media brand perception, it could have a negative impact on our operations, financial results and reputation.\nMaintaining a good reputation is critical to our business. Social media has increased the risk that our reputation could be negatively impacted in a short amount of time. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to occurrences of negative publicity through social media or otherwise, we may suffer declines in customer loyalty and traffic, vendor relationship issues, diversion of management\u2019s time to respond and other adverse effects, all of which could negatively impact our operations, financial results and reputation.\nRisk Related to Liquidity\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may not be able to implement our business strategies and fund our obligations.\nThe ability to execute our strategic initiatives will depend on, among other factors, the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt capital. The cost of expanding our omni-channel capabilities including improving our online sales capabilities, closing under-performing stores, opening new stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores may increase in the future compared to historical costs. There can be no assurance that our business will generate adequate cash flow or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, our senior credit facility contains provisions that restrict the amount of debt we may incur in the future. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital, we may be unable to increase sales generated online and optimize our store footprint, which may adversely affect our business strategy. There can be no assurances that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations or adequate capital to achieve our plans for omni-channel growth including growing online sales and optimizing our store footprint.\nInsufficient cash flows from operations could result in the substantial utilization of our secured revolving credit facility or similar financing, which may limit our ability to conduct certain activities.\nWe dependent upon generating sufficient cash flows from operations to fund our obligations and strategic investments. We maintain a secured revolving credit facility to enable us to acquire merchandise, fund working capital requirements as well as to support standby letters of credit. Borrowings under the secured revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base calculation consisting of a percentage of certain of our eligible assets and are subject to advance rates and commercially reasonable reserves. Substantial utilization of the available borrowing base will result in various restrictions, including restrictions on the ability to repurchase our common stock or pay dividends and an increase in the lender\u2019s control over the Company\u2019s cash accounts. We renewed our revolving credit facility in December 2019. The facility contains a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants that may also limit our actions. Continued negative cash flows from operations could result in increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund operational needs, increased utilization of letters of credit and greater dependence on the availability of the revolving credit facility. These actions could result in us being subject to increased restrictions, incurring increased interest expense and increasing of our leverage. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nThe uncertainty regarding the potential phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur secured revolving credit facility bears interest based on LIBOR. Any changes in regulatory standards or industry practices, such as the transition away from LIBOR as a benchmark reference for short-term interest, may result in the usage of a higher reference rate for our variable debt.\nRisks Related to Profitability\nWe face an extremely competitive specialty retail business market, and such competition could result in a reduction of our prices and a loss of our market share.\nThe retail market is a highly competitive market. We compete against a diverse group of retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, catalog and internet-based retailers, which sell similar lines of merchandise to those carried by us. The substantial sales growth in the e-commerce industry within the last decade has encouraged the entry of many new competitors, including discount retailers selling similar products at reduced prices, new business models, and an increase in competition from established companies, many of whom are willing to spend significant funds and/or reduce pricing in order to gain market share. Our competitors, many of which are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, include HomeGoods, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Cost Plus World Market, Hobby Lobby, Pier 1 Imports, At Home, Target, Ebay, Amazon and Wayfair. Our \u201cbrick-and-mortar\u201d stores and our www.kirklands.com website also compete with the ever-increasing number of internet retail websites offering home d\u00e9cor merchandise. The availability of home d\u00e9cor merchandise from various competitors on the internet could result in increased price competition as our customers are more readily able to comparison shop, which could reduce our sales, prices and margins and adversely affect our results of operations. Further, unanticipated changes in pricing or other practices of our competitors, including promotional activity, such as thresholds for free shipping and rapid price fluctuation enabled by technology, may adversely affect our performance.\nCompetitors may have greater financial, distribution, logistics, marketing and other resources available to them and may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the design, sourcing, distribution, marketing and sale of their products, generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our competitors may also be able to increase sales in their new and existing markets faster than we do by emphasizing different distribution channels than we do.\nIf we are unable to overcome these potential competitive disadvantages, such factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results could be negatively impacted if our merchandise offering suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues.\nMaintaining, promoting and growing our merchandise offering will depend largely on the success of our design, merchandising, and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. If we fail to achieve these objectives, our public image and reputation could be tarnished by negative publicity.\nIf our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or customer expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns with respect to our products could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative customer perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us to regain customer confidence.\nOur business depends upon hiring, training and retaining qualified employees.\nThe success of our strategic plans are dependent on our ability to promote and recruit a sufficient number of quality employees in our stores, distribution centers and headquarters. Our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense, and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage and benefits. In addition, the implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions and benefits for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively impact our operating results. We cannot be assured that we can continue to hire, train and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk of market increases in compensation.\nThe success of our store strategy depends on our ability to hire, train and retain qualified multi-unit managers, store managers and sales associates to support our stores. In addition, the time and effort required to train and supervise a large number of new managers and associates due to seasonal hiring practices, excessive turnover or new store openings may divert resources from our existing stores and adversely affect our operating and financial performance.\nWe also depend on hiring qualified personnel at our distribution centers, especially during our peak season in the third and fourth quarters leading up to the holiday selling season. Not being able to hire or find temporary qualified help during this season, could lead to bottlenecks in the supply chain and products not arriving timely in stores, which could negatively impact sales.\nWeather conditions could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability by affecting consumer shopping patterns.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. Adverse weather conditions or other extreme changes in the weather, including resulting electrical and technological failures, may disrupt our business and may adversely affect our ability to sell and distribute products. Frequent or unusual snow, ice or rain storms or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our performance by affecting customer shopping patterns or diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and thereby reduce our sales and profitability.\nWe are exposed to the risk of natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, global political events, war and terrorism that could disrupt our business and result in lower sales, increased operating costs and capital expenditures.\nOur headquarters, store locations, distribution centers and warehouses, as well as certain of our vendors and customers, are located in areas that have been and could be subject to natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires or earthquakes. In addition, we operate in markets that may be susceptible to pandemic outbreaks, war, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, such as civil unrest in countries in which our vendors are located or products are manufactured. Our business may be harmed if our ability to sell and distribute products is impacted by any such events, any of which could influence customer trends and purchases and may negatively impact our net sales, properties or operations. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of some or all of our stores or distribution centers, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary or long-term disruption in the transport of goods, delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution center or stores, disruption of our technology support or information systems, or fuel shortages or dramatic increases in fuel prices, which increase the cost of doing business. These events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage. Any of these factors, or combination thereof, could adversely affect our operations.\nThe recent Coronavirus outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and recently has spread to the United States and many other parts of the world and may adversely affect our business operations, store traffic, employee availability, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow both in the U.S. and globally and related government and private sector responsive actions may adversely affect our business operations. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has already affected our supply chain. In recent days, this outbreak has resulted in reduced customer traffic and the temporary reduction of store operating hours, which was then followed by the temporary closure of all our stores. These recent developments are expected to negatively impact sales and gross margin in the near term. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the situation is rapidly evolving. While it appears that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States is in the early stages, the recent downturn in financial market indices appear to have been primarily driven by uncertainties associated with the pandemic. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the potential adverse effect of the pandemic on the economy, our supply chain partners, travel and transportation services, our employees and customers, customer sentiment in general and traffic within the shopping centers containing our stores. The pandemic could adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows and may require significant actions in response including but not limited to employee furloughs, reduced store hours, store closings, expense reductions or discounting of the pricing of our products, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nOur performance may be affected by general economic conditions.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors that have had, and may in the future have, an impact on discretionary consumer spending include national or global economic downturns, an increase in consumer debt (and a corresponding decrease in the availability of affordable consumer credit), reductions in net worth based on recent severe market declines, softness in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, changes in taxation, increases in fuel and energy prices, fluctuation in interest rates, low consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors.\nSpecialty retail is a cyclical industry that is heavily dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending. Purchases of home d\u00e9cor tend to be highly correlated with cycles in consumers\u2019 disposable income and trends in the housing market. A weak retail environment could impact customer traffic in our stores and also adversely affect our net sales. Because of the seasonality of our business, economic downturns, increased sourcing costs, or scarcity in equipment during the last quarter of our fiscal year could adversely affect us to a greater extent than if such downturns occurred at other times of the year. As purchases of home d\u00e9cor items may decline during recessionary periods, a prolonged recession, including any related decrease in consumers\u2019 disposable incomes, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShould credit markets tighten or turmoil in the financial markets develop, our ability to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities would be adversely impacted.\nThe impact of any such credit crisis or market turmoil on our major suppliers cannot be accurately predicted. The inability of key suppliers to access liquidity, or the insolvency of key suppliers, could lead to their failure to deliver our merchandise. Worsening economic conditions could also result in difficulties for financial institutions (including bank failures) and other parties with whom we do business, which could potentially impair our ability to access financing under existing arrangements or to otherwise recover amounts as they become due under our other contractual arrangements.\nOur profitability is vulnerable to inflation and cost increases.\nFuture increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise, shipping rates, freight costs, fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability. These cost increases may be the result of inflationary pressures that could further reduce our sales or profitability. Increases in other operating costs, including changes in energy prices, wage rates and lease and utility costs, may increase our cost of goods sold or operating expenses. Competitive pressures in our industry may have the effect of inhibiting our ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of our products and therefore reduce our profitability.\nOur business is highly seasonal and our fourth quarter contributes to a disproportionate amount of our net sales, net income and cash flow, and any factors negatively impacting us during our fourth quarter could reduce our net sales, net income and cash flow, leaving us with excess inventory and making it more difficult for us to finance our capital requirements.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, substantial seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results, which are typical of many specialty retailers and common to most retailers generally. Due to the importance of the fall selling season, which includes Thanksgiving and Christmas, the last quarter of our fiscal year has historically contributed, and is expected to continue to contribute, a disproportionate amount of our net sales, net income and cash flow for the entire fiscal year. Any factors negatively affecting us during the last quarter of our fiscal year, including unfavorable economic or weather conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, reducing our cash flow, leaving us with excess inventory and making it more difficult for us to finance our capital requirements.\nInventory loss and theft and the inability to anticipate inventory needs may result in reduced net sales.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. We have experienced inventory shrinkage in the past, and we cannot assure that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft, our financial condition could be affected adversely.\nEfficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers\u2019 demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results. If our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends or purchasing actions, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial results. Though we attempt to reduce these risks, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in our inventory management, which may negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nFailure to control merchandise returns could negatively impact the business.\nWe have established a provision for estimated merchandise returns based upon historical experience and other known factors. If actual returns are greater than those projected by management, additional reductions of revenue could be recorded in the future. Also, to the extent that returned merchandise is damaged, we may not receive full retail value from the resale of the returned merchandise. Introductions of new merchandise, changes in merchandise mix, associate selling behavior, merchandise quality issues, changes to our return policy, e-commerce return behavior, changes in consumer confidence, or other competitive and general economic conditions may cause actual returns to exceed the provision for estimated merchandise returns. An increase in merchandise returns that exceeds our current provision could negatively impact the business and financial results.\nWe may experience significant variations in our quarterly results.\nOur quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly based upon such factors as the timing of new store openings, pre-opening expenses associated with new stores, the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores, net sales contributed by new stores, timing of store closures, increases or decreases in comparable store net sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of holidays, the timing and level of markdowns, changes in fuel and other shipping costs, changes in our product mix and actions taken by our competitors. Consequently, comparisons between quarters are not necessarily meaningful and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOur comparable store net sales fluctuate due to a variety of factors.\nNumerous factors affect our comparable store net sales results, including among others, weather conditions, retail trends, the retail sales environment, economic conditions, the impact of competition and our ability to execute our business strategy efficiently. Our comparable store net sales results have historically experienced fluctuations, including declines in some fiscal periods. Our comparable store net sales may not increase from quarter to quarter, or may decline. As a result, the unpredictability of our comparable store net sales may cause our revenues and operating results to vary quarter to quarter, and an unanticipated decline in revenues or comparable store net sales may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nOur Freight Costs and thus Our Cost of Goods Sold are Impacted by Changes in Fuel Prices.\nOur freight cost is impacted by changes in fuel prices through surcharges. Fuel prices and surcharges affect freight costs with respect to both inbound freight from vendors to our distribution centers and outbound freight from our distribution centers to our stores. Increased fuel prices or surcharges may increase freight costs and thereby increase our cost of goods sold.\nRisks Related to New Legislation, Regulation and Litigation\nNew legal requirements could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. We routinely incur costs in complying with these laws and regulations. We are exposed to the risk that federal, state or local legislation may negatively impact our operations. Changes in product regulations (including changes in labeling or disclosure requirements), federal or state wage requirements, employee rights (including changes in the process for our employees to join a union), health care, social welfare or entitlement programs such as health insurance, paid leave programs, or other changes in workplace regulation or tax laws could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial targets. Changes in other regulatory areas, such as consumer credit, privacy and information security, or environmental regulation may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and/or could materially increase our costs of doing business. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to legal risk, including government enforcement action, significant fines and penalties and class action litigation, as well as reputational damage, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nConcern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. If domestic or international laws or regulations were expanded to require GHG emission reporting or reduction by us or our third-party manufacturers, or if we engage third-party contract manufacturers in countries that have existing GHG emission reporting or reduction laws or regulations, we would need to expend financial and other resources to comply with such regulations and/or to monitor our third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with such regulations. In addition, we cannot control the actions of our third-party manufacturers or the public\u2019s perceptions of them, nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using climate change proactive or sustainable practices. Violations of climate change laws or regulations by third parties with whom we do business could result in negative public perception of us and/or delays in shipments and receipt of goods, and could subject us to fines or other penalties, any of which could restrict our business activities, increase our operating expenses or cause our sales to decline.\nThe costs and other effects of new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. Additional laws may directly or indirectly affect our production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients or water, any of which could impact our business and financial results. In addition, our efforts to comply with new legislation or regulations may increase our costs.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, vendors, competitors, intellectual property rights holders, shareholders, government agencies and others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation means. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property claims, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our consolidated financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our reputation.\nDespite our best efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the products we sell, we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to allegations that the products sold by us are misbranded, contain contaminants or impermissible ingredients, provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or misuse, or include inadequate warnings concerning flammability or interactions with other substances. Such claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling and transportation phases. All of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product and safety laws. We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers. However, if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturer\u2019s lack of understanding of United States product liability or other laws, which may make it more likely that we be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. Our litigation expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.\nIf we fail to protect our brand name, competitors may adopt trade names that dilute the value of our brand name.\nWe may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce our trademarks in each jurisdiction in which we do business. Also, we may not always be able to successfully enforce our trademarks against competitors or against challenges by others. Our failure to successfully protect our trademarks could diminish the value and efficacy of our brand recognition and could cause customer confusion, which could, in turn, adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nRisks Associated with Vendors and Distribution\nWe are dependent on foreign imports for a significant portion of our merchandise, and any changes in the trading relations and conditions between the United States and the relevant foreign countries may lead to a decline in inventory resulting in a decline in net sales, or an increase in the cost of sales resulting in reduced gross profit.\nMost of our merchandise is purchased through vendors in the United States who import the merchandise from foreign countries, primarily China. Our vendors are subject to the risks involved with relying on products manufactured abroad, and we remain subject to those risks to the extent that their effects are passed through to us by our vendors or cause disruptions in supply. These risks include changes in import duties, quotas, loss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status with the United States for a particular foreign country, work stoppages, delays in shipments, first cost price increases, freight cost increases, exchange rate fluctuations, terrorism, public health crises, war, economic uncertainties (including inflation, foreign government regulations and political unrest), trade restrictions (including the United States imposing anti-dumping or countervailing duty orders, safeguards, remedies or compensation and retaliation due to illegal foreign trade practices) and other factors relating to foreign trade, including costs and uncertainties associated with efforts to identify and disclose sources of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d used in products that the Company causes to be manufactured and potential sell-through difficulties and reputational damage that may be associated with the inability of the Company to determine that such products are classified as \u201cDRC conflict-free.\u201d If any of these or other factors were to cause a disruption of trade from the countries in which the suppliers of our vendors are located, our inventory levels may be reduced or the cost of our products may increase. For example, the recent outbreak of Covid-19 first identified in Wuhan, China has led to work and travel restrictions in and out of China as well as temporary closures or production and logistics constraints due to workforce availability of certain factories in China. These travel restrictions, factory closures, production and logistics constraints may result in delayed shipments and increased shipping costs for some of our fiscal 2020 merchandise.\nWe cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in foreign countries may have on our operations. Although we believe that we could access alternative sources in the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic, political or health conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays may adversely affect our results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements can be made. In addition, merchandise purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the merchandise we currently purchase abroad.\nCountries from which our vendors obtain these products may, from time to time, impose new or adjust prevailing quotas or other restrictions on exported products, and the United States may impose new duties, quotas and other restrictions on imported products. This could disrupt the supply of such products to us and adversely affect our operations. The United States Congress periodically considers other restrictions on the importation of products obtained for us by vendors. The cost of such products may increase for us if applicable duties are raised or import quotas with respect to such products are imposed or made more restrictive.\nA substantial portion of our fiscal 2019 net sales were derived from merchandise produced in China. We have developed strategies to try to mitigate the impact of current and future proposed tariffs, including collaborative efforts with our vendor partners and raising retail prices. There can be no assurance as to the final scope of the tariffs that will be imposed or the course or timing of trade negotiations between the United States and China to resolve the issues that led the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to impose the tariffs. Imposition of the tariffs in 2020 or future fiscal years could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods sold and results of operations.\nWe depend on a number of vendors to supply our merchandise, and any delay in merchandise deliveries from certain vendors may lead to a decline in inventory, which could result in a loss of net sales.\nAny disruption in the supply or increase in pricing of our merchandise could negatively impact our ability to achieve anticipated operating results. We purchase our products from approximately 200 vendors with which we have no long-term purchase commitments or exclusivity contracts. Historically, we have retained our vendors, and we have generally not experienced difficulty in obtaining desired merchandise from vendors on acceptable terms. However, our arrangements with these vendors do not guarantee the availability of merchandise, establish guaranteed prices or provide for the continuation of particular pricing practices. Our current vendors may not continue to sell products to us on current terms or at all, and we may not be able to establish relationships with new vendors to ensure delivery of products in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us. In addition, a period of unfavorable financial performance may make it difficult for some of our vendors to arrange for the financing or factoring of their orders with manufacturers, which could result in our inability to obtain desired merchandise from those vendors.\nFor part of fiscal 2019, our largest vendor was deemed to be a related party for financial reporting purposes because its principal owner is the spouse of our former Vice President of Product Development and Trends. As of June 14, 2019, the vendor is no longer a related party. During fiscal 2019, the Company\u2019s purchases from our largest vendor totaled approximately $44.7 million, or 17.4% of total merchandise purchases. Any disruption in the relationship with this vendor could negatively impact our ability to achieve anticipated operating results.\nWe may not be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future. Also, our business would be adversely affected if there were delays in product shipments to us due to freight difficulties, strikes or other difficulties at our principal transport providers or otherwise. We have from time to time experienced delays of this nature. We are also dependent on vendors for assuring the quality of merchandise supplied to us. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise in the future or the loss of one or more of our vendors and our failure to replace any one or more of them may harm our relationship with our customers resulting in a loss of net sales.\nOur success is highly dependent on our planning and control processes and our supply chain, and any disruption in or failure to continue to improve these processes may result in a loss of net sales and net income.\nAn important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies, cost reductions and net sales growth is the continued identification and implementation of improvements to our planning, logistical and distribution infrastructure and our supply chain, including merchandise ordering, transportation and receipt processing. In addition, recent increases in energy prices have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in increased merchandise and freight costs, which cannot readily be offset through higher prices because of competitive factors.\nA significant portion of the distribution of products to our stores and directly to our customers is coordinated through our west coast bypass operation, our two distribution facilities in Jackson, Tennessee and our third-party distribution center in Dallas, Texas. We depend on the orderly operation of these receiving and distribution facilities, which rely on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management. We are also currently exploring alternative distribution methods and from time to time we make significant upgrades to our warehouse management software. If these changes or upgrades do not go smoothly, then we could face significant disruptions with our distribution process. In addition, we cannot assure that events beyond our control, such as disruptions due to fire or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or shipping problems, will not result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores. We also cannot guarantee that our insurance will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us, in the event our distribution center is shut down for any reason. Any significant disruption in the operations of our distribution facilities would have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain proper inventory levels in our stores and satisfy our online orders, which could result in a loss of net sales and net income.\nOur business could suffer if a manufacturer fails to use acceptable labor and environmental practices.\nWe do not control our vendors or the manufacturers that produce the products we buy from them, nor do we control the labor and environmental practices of our vendors and these manufacturers. The violation of labor, safety, environmental and/or other laws and standards by any of our vendors or these manufacturers, or the divergence of the labor and environmental practices followed by any of our vendors or these manufacturers from those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S., could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt, the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. In that regard, most of the products we sell are manufactured overseas, primarily in China, which may increase the risk that the labor and environmental practices followed by the manufacturers of these products may differ from those considered acceptable in the U.S.\nAdditionally, our products are subject to regulation of and regulatory standards set by various governmental authorities with respect to quality and safety. These regulations and standards may change from time to time. Our inability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements could result in significant fines or penalties, which could adversely affect our reputation and sales. Issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we sell, regardless of our culpability, or customer concerns about such issues, could result in damage to our reputation, lost sales, uninsured product liability claims or losses, merchandise recalls and increased costs.\nRisks Related to Dependence on Technology\nFailure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our customers and employees could expose us to litigation and damage our reputation; the expansion of our e-commerce business has inherent cybersecurity risks that may result in business disruptions.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and employees in the ordinary course of business. Our use of this information is regulated at the international, federal and state levels, as well as by certain third parties with whom we contract for such services. If our security and information systems are compromised or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, as well as operations, results of operations, and financial condition and could result in litigation or the imposition of penalties. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance. Our business requires collection of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various information systems and those of our service providers. The integrity and protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to us. If that data is inaccurate or incomplete, we or the store employees could make faulty decisions. Customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding. Our existing systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time to do so. Despite implementation of various measures designed to protect our information systems and records, including those we maintain with our service providers, we may be subject to security breaches, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee, or company data maintained by us or by a service provider or failure to comply with the various United States and international laws and regulations applicable to the protection of such data or with Payment Card Industry data security standards, could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines, or litigation. A breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits.\nCertain aspects of the business, particularly our website, heavily depend on consumers entrusting personal financial information to be transmitted securely over public networks. We have experienced increasing e-commerce sales over the past several years, which increases our exposure to cybersecurity risks. We invest considerable resources in protecting the personal information of our customers but are still subject to the risks of security breaches and cyber incidents resulting in unauthorized access to stored personal information. Any breach of our cybersecurity measures could result in violation of privacy laws, potential litigation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, all of which could have a negative impact on our financial results and our reputation. In addition, a privacy breach or other type of cybercrime or cybersecurity attack could cause us to incur significant costs to restore the integrity of our system, could require the devotion of significant management resources, and could result in significant costs in government penalties and private litigation.\nOur hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage that could harm our business.\nWe rely upon our existing information systems for operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business, including sales, warehousing, distribution, purchasing, inventory control, merchandise planning and replenishment, as well as various financial functions. These systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022\nfire, flood and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\npower loss, computer systems failures, internet and telecommunications or data network failure, operator negligence, improper operation by or supervision of employees, physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events; and\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses and malicious attacks and security breaches.\nAny disruption in the operation of our information systems, the loss of employees knowledgeable about such systems or our failure to continue to effectively modify such systems could interrupt our operations or interfere with our ability to monitor inventory, which could result in reduced net sales and affect our operations and financial performance. We also need to ensure that our systems are consistently adequate to handle our anticipated store growth and are upgraded as necessary to meet our needs. The cost of any such system upgrades or enhancements would be significant. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe also rely heavily on our information technology staff. Failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems. We rely on certain vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business. The software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. The inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology, or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.\nRisks Related to Company Governance and Ownership\nWe depend on key personnel, and, if we lose the services of any member of our senior management team, we may not be able to run our business effectively.\nWe have benefited substantially from the leadership and performance of our senior management team. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our current senior management members and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management personnel is intense, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to retain our personnel.\nOn January 16, 2020, we announced that we had mutually parted ways with President and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Cairnes. Steve Woodward, Chief Executive Officer, added the role of President, and Mr. Woodward now oversees operations in addition to his ongoing responsibilities across merchandising and marketing. There can be no assurance that the reduced executive team can suitably perform these additional operational responsibilities.\nOur charter and bylaw provisions and certain provisions of Tennessee law may make it difficult in some respects to cause a change in control of Kirkland\u2019s and replace incumbent management.\nOur charter authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. Holders of our common stock do not have preemptive rights to subscribe for a pro rata portion of any capital stock that may be issued by us. In the event of issuance, such preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of Kirkland\u2019s.\nOur charter and bylaws contain certain corporate governance provisions that may make it more difficult to challenge management, deter and inhibit unsolicited changes in control of Kirkland\u2019s and have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock in the event of an attempted hostile takeover. First, the charter provides for a classified Board of Directors, with directors (after the expiration of the terms of the initial classified board of directors) serving three-year terms from the year of their respective elections and being subject to removal only for cause and upon the vote of 80% of the voting power of all outstanding capital stock entitled to vote (the \u201cVoting Power\u201d). Second, our charter and bylaws do not generally permit shareholders to call, or require that the Board of Directors call, a special meeting of shareholders. The charter and bylaws also limit the business permitted to be conducted at any such special meeting. In addition, Tennessee law permits action to be taken by the shareholders by written consent only if the action is consented to by holders of the number of shares required to authorize shareholder action and if all shareholders entitled to vote are parties to the written consent. Third, the bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for shareholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before meetings of the shareholders. Only those shareholder nominees who are nominated in accordance with this procedure are eligible for election as directors of Kirkland\u2019s, and only such shareholder proposals may be considered at a meeting of shareholders as have been presented to Kirkland\u2019s in accordance with the procedure. Finally, the charter provides that the amendment or repeal of any of the foregoing provisions of the charter mentioned previously in this paragraph requires the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Voting Power. In addition, the bylaws provide that the amendment or repeal by shareholders of any bylaws made by our Board of Directors requires the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Voting Power.\nFurthermore, Kirkland\u2019s is subject to certain provisions of Tennessee law, including certain Tennessee corporate takeover acts that are, or may be, applicable to us. These acts, which include the Investor Protection Act, the Business Combination Act and the Tennessee Greenmail Act, seek to limit the parameters in which certain business combinations and share exchanges occur. The charter, bylaws and Tennessee law provisions may have an anti-takeover effect, including possibly discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.\nAs a public company, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can certify the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, we may incur substantial expenses to test our systems, to make any necessary improvements, and to hire additional personnel.\nWe maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, but there are limitations inherent in internal control systems. If we are unable to maintain adequate and effective internal control over financial reporting, our financial reporting could be adversely affected. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be appropriate relative to their costs.\nIf our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could harm our business and cause a decline in our common stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our common stock price and harm our ability to raise capital.\nThe market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in the value of your investment.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends and prospects for the retail industry, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, the condition of the financial markets and other factors. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance.\nIf we fail to remain in compliance with The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted.\nThe Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements include maintaining a stock price over $1, having a minimum number of stockholders, maintaining a minimum market value and other requirements. If we fail to stay in compliance with any of these requirements, our stock could be delisted from the Nasdaq. The delisting of our common stock on any exchange could reduce the liquidity of the market for our common stock, which could reduce the price of our common stock and increase the volatility of our common stock price.", "PERMNO": 89449, "SIC": 5990, "TIC": "KIRK"}
