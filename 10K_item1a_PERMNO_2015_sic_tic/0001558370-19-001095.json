{"cik": "805928", "company": "Axogen, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAxogen\u2019s business involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond its control. The risk and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Set forth below is a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that management believes to be material to Axogen.\nRisks Related To The Company\nAxogen has not experienced positive cash flow from its operations, and the ability to achieve positive cash flow from operations will depend on increasing revenue from distribution of its products, which may not be achievable.\nAxogen has historically operated with negative cash flow from its operations. As of December 31, 2018, Axogen had an accumulated deficit of approximately $151 million. If revenue does not increase as anticipated, then it will continue to experience negative cash flows and adverse operating conditions. Axogen\u2019s continuing capital needs and other factors could cause the Company to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or from other sources. The sale of additional equity may result in dilution to Axogen\u2019s shareholders. There is no assurance that Axogen will be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to it, or at all.\nAxogen\u2019s revenue growth depends on its ability to expand its sales force, increase distribution and sales to existing customers and develop new customers, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will result in significant increases in sales.\nAxogen is in the process of investing in its distribution and sales channels composed of a combination of its direct sales force and independent agencies/distributors to allow it to increase distribution and sales to existing customers and reach new customers. There can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in expanding Axogen\u2019s revenue. Axogen currently distributes tissue and sells products directly through its sales force and indirectly through agency relationships. Axogen is engaged in an initiative to build and further expand sales and marketing capabilities. The incurrence of these expenses impacts Axogen\u2019s operating results, and there can be no assurance of their effectiveness. If Axogen is unable to develop its sales force, increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers, it may not be able to grow revenue or maintain its current level of revenue generation.\nAxogen\u2019s revenue depends primarily on four products.\nSubstantially all of Axogen\u2019s revenue is currently derived from only four products, Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft, Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane, Axoguard\u00ae Nerve Protector and Axoguard\u00ae Nerve Connector, for the treatment of peripheral nerve damage. Of these four products, the Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft represents approximately half of the Company\u2019s total revenues. Any disruption in Axogen\u2019s ability to generate revenue from the distribution of tissue and sale of products will have a material adverse impact on Axogen\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nThe Axoguard\u00ae products are only available through an exclusive distribution agreement with Cook Biotech. The agreement was amended February 26, 2018 to run through June 30, 2027. However, there are conditions for continuation of the agreement, including payment terms and minimum purchase requirements, that if breached could result in an earlier termination of the agreement; except that through mutual agreement the parties have not established such minimums and to date have not enforced such minimum purchase provision. Additionally, in the event that Axogen and Cook Biotech were to fail to reach an agreement as to minimum purchase quantities, Cook Biotech could terminate the agreement if it was deemed that Axogen had failed to generate commercially reasonable sales of Axoguard\u00ae as measured by sales similar to a competitive product at the same stage in its commercial launch as verified by a mutually acceptable third party. Although there are products that Axogen believes it could develop or obtain that would replace the Axoguard\u00ae products obtained through the agreement with Cook Biotech, the loss of the ability to sell the Axoguard\u00ae products could have a material adverse effect on Axogen\u2019s business until other replacement products are available.\nAxogen\u2019s success will be dependent on continued acceptance of its products by the medical community.\nContinued market acceptance of Axogen\u2019s products will depend on its ability to demonstrate that its products are an attractive alternative to existing nerve reconstruction treatment options and provide appropriate solutions for nerve repair. Its ability to do so will depend on surgeons\u2019 evaluations of clinical safety, efficacy, ease of use, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of Axogen\u2019s nerve repair products. For example, although Axogen\u2019s Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft follows stringent safety standards, including sterilization by gamma irradiation, Axogen believes that a small portion of the medical community has lingering concerns over the risk of disease transmission through the use of allografts in general. Furthermore, Axogen believes that even if its products receive general acceptance within the medical community, acceptance and clinical recommendations by influential surgeons will be important to the commercial success of Axogen\u2019s products.\nNegative publicity concerning methods of donating human tissue and screening of donated tissue, in the industry in which Axogen operates, may reduce demand for its products and negatively impact the supply of available donor tissue.\nAxogen is highly dependent on its ability to recover human peripheral nerve tissue from tissue donors for its Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft product and acquire birth tissue for its Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane. The availability of acceptable donors is relatively limited, and this availability is impacted by regulatory changes, general public opinion of the donation process and Axogen\u2019s reputation for its handling of the donation process. Media reports or other negative publicity concerning both improper methods of tissue recovery from donors and disease transmission from donated tissue, including bones and tendons, may limit widespread acceptance of Axogen\u2019s Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft and Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane. Unfavorable reports of improper or illegal tissue recovery practices, both in the U.S. and internationally, as well as incidents of improperly processed tissue leading to transmission of disease, may broadly affect the rate of future tissue donation and market acceptance of allograft technologies and donated tissue use. Potential patients may not be able to distinguish Axogen products, technologies, and tissue recovery and processing procedures from others engaged in tissue recovery. In addition, unfavorable reports could make families of potential donors or donors themselves from whom Axogen is required to obtain consent before processing tissue reluctant to agree to donate tissue to for-profit tissue processors. Any disruption in the supply could have negative consequences for Axogen\u2019s revenue, operating results and continued operations.\nAxogen is highly dependent on the continued availability of its facilities and could be harmed if the facilities are unavailable for any prolonged period of time.\nAny failure in the physical infrastructure of Axogen\u2019s facilities, including the facility it licenses from CTS, could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce its revenues and harm its business reputation and financial results. Any natural or man-made event that impacts Axogen\u2019s ability to utilize its facilities could have a significant impact on its operating results, reputation and ability to continue operations. This includes termination of the CTS Agreement which is subject to earlier termination by either party at any time for cause (subject to the non-terminating party\u2019s right to cure, in certain circumstances), or without cause by Axogen upon 6 months prior notice wherebysuch notice cannot be provided until March 1, 2021. Axogen believes it can find and make operational a new licensed facility in less than six months, if required. In addition, Axogen acquired property which is located near the CTS facility and it is expected that renovations will be completed by the termination date of the CTS Agreement to provide a new processing facility that can be included in our BLA for the Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft. However, the regulatory process for approval of facilities whether licensed or owned is time-consuming and unpredictable. Axogen\u2019s ability to license, renovate, rebuild or find acceptable service facilities takes a considerable amount of time and expense and could cause a significant disruption in service to its customers if it were to lose the availability of its production or distribution facilities. Although Axogen has business interruption insurance which would, in instances other than service agreement termination, cover certain costs, it may not cover all costs nor help to regain Axogen\u2019s standing in the market.\nAxogen must maintain high quality processing of its products.\nAxogen\u2019s Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft is processed through its Avance\u00ae Process which requires careful calibration and precise, high-quality processing and manufacturing. Its Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane is also human tissue that requires skill in its processing. Achieving precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by its personnel. If it fails to achieve and maintain these high levels of quality control and processing standards, including avoidance of processing errors, defects or product failures, Axogen could experience recalls or withdrawals of its product, delays in delivery, cost overruns or other problems that would adversely affect its business. Axogen reported two (2) biological deviations in 2018 for quality system issues related to human tissue distribution (no patient safety issues were involved) and corrective action was taken without a material adverse consequence to Axogen. Axogen cannot completely eliminate the risk of errors, defects or failures. In addition, Axogen may experience difficulties in scaling-up processing of its Avance\u00ae and Avive\u00ae products, including problems related to yields, quality control and assurance, tissue availability, adequacy of control policies and procedures, and lack of skilled personnel. If Axogen is unable to process and produce its human tissue products on a timely basis, at acceptable quality and costs, and in sufficient quantities, or if it experiences unanticipated technological problems or delays in production, its business would be adversely affected.\nDelays, interruptions or the cessation of production by Axogen\u2019s third party suppliers of important materials or delays in qualifying new materials, may prevent or delay Axogen\u2019s ability to manufacture or process the final products.\nMost of the raw materials used in the process for Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft and Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane are available from more than one supplier. However, one of the chemicals Axogen used in the processing of Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft, Triton X-200, is no longer manufactured by the original single source provider. Axogen developed and outsourced an identical chemical replacement for Triton X-200 and validated Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft processing using that replacement. The FDA was notified of this change in August of 2018 with an IND Amendment and Axogen has transitioned to using the new supplier. In addition, some of the test results, packaging and reagents/chemicals Axogen uses in its manufacturing process are also obtained from single suppliers. Axogen does not have written contracts with any of its single source suppliers, and at any time they could stop supplying Axogen\u2019s orders. FDA review of a new supplier may be required if these materials become unavailable from Axogen\u2019s current suppliers. Although there may be other suppliers that have equivalent materials that would be available to Axogen, FDA review of any alternate suppliers, if required, could take several months or years to obtain, if able to be obtained at all. Any delay, interruption or cessation of production by Axogen\u2019s third party suppliers of important materials, or any delay in qualifying new materials, if necessary, would prevent or delay Axogen\u2019s ability to manufacture products. In addition, an uncorrected impurity, a supplier\u2019s variation in a raw material or testing, either unknown to Axogen or incompatible with its manufacturing process, or any other problem with Axogen\u2019s materials, testing or components, would prevent or delay its ability to\nprocess tissue. These delays may limit Axogen\u2019s ability to meet demand for its products and delay its clinical trial, which would have a material adverse impact on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure of third parties to perform many necessary services for the commercialization of Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft and Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane, including services related to recovery/acquisition, distribution and transportation, would impair Axogen\u2019s ability to meet commercial demand.\nAxogen relies upon third parties for certain recovery/acquisition, distribution and transportation services for its Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft and Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane. In accordance with product specifications, third parties ship Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft in specially validated shipping containers at frozen temperatures. If any of the third parties that Axogen relies upon in its recovery/acquisition, distribution or transportation process fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to Axogen, or encounter physical damage or natural disaster at their facilities, Axogen\u2019s ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand may be significantly impaired.\nAxogen is dependent on its relationships with independent agencies to generate revenue.\nAxogen derives material revenues through its relationships with independent agencies. If certain agency relationships were terminated for any reason, it could materially and adversely affect Axogen\u2019s ability to generate revenues and profits. If Axogen required additional agencies it may not be able to find additional agencies who will agree to market and distribute Axogen\u2019s products on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If Axogen is unable to establish new agency relationships or renew certain current distribution agreements on commercially acceptable terms, its operating results could suffer.\nLoss of key members of management, who it needs to succeed, could adversely affect its business.\nAxogen\u2019s future success depends on the continued efforts of the members of its senior management team. Competition for experienced management personnel in the healthcare industry is intense. If one or more of Axogen\u2019s senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, or if Axogen is unable to attract and retain high quality senior executives or key personnel in the future, its business may be adversely affected.\nAxogen\u2019s operating results will be harmed if it is unable to effectively manage and sustain its future growth or scale its operations.\nThere can be no assurance that Axogen will be able to manage its future growth efficiently or profitably. Its business is unproven on a large scale and actual revenue and operating margins, or revenue and margin growth, may be less than expected. If Axogen is unable to scale its production capabilities efficiently or maintain pricing without significant discounting, it may fail to achieve expected operating margins, which would have a material and adverse effect on its operating results. Growth may also stress Axogen\u2019s ability to adequately manage its operations, quality of products, safety and regulatory compliance. If growth significantly decreases it will negatively impact Axogen\u2019s cash reserves, and it may be required to obtain additional financing, which may increase indebtedness or result in dilution to shareholders. Further, there can be no assurance that Axogen would be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms if all at.\nThere may be significant fluctuations in Axogen\u2019s operating results.\nSignificant quarterly fluctuations in Axogen\u2019s results of operations may be caused by, among other factors, its volume of revenues, seasonal changes in nerve repair activity, timing of sales force expansion and general economic conditions. There can be no assurance that the level of revenues and profits, if any, achieved by Axogen in any particular fiscal period, will not be significantly lower than in other comparable fiscal periods. Axogen\u2019s expense levels are based, in part, on its expectations as to future revenues. As a result, if future revenues are below expectations, net income or loss may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues, as any corresponding reduction in expenses may not be proportionate to the reduction in revenues.\nAxogen\u2019s revenues depend upon prompt and adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. The ability of a hospital or an ambulatory surgery center (\u201cASC\u201d) to pay fees for Axogen\u2019s products depends in part on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for either our products specifically, the procedures associated with the use of our products, or both. Providers that purchase our products generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with our products or the products themselves. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, therefore, is important for obtaining product acceptance and widespread adoption in the marketplace.\nWhen our products (Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft, Axoguard\u00ae Connector, Axoguard\u00ae Protector, Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane) are used in the operating room of a hospital, they are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in surgery and the cost is included in payment to the facility for the procedure. When Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft and Axoguard\u00ae Connector are used in an outpatient setting where the nerve repair is the primary reason for the procedure, facilities may use a Category I CPT code to facilitate payment.\nIn January 2018, the American Medical Association created a Category I CPT code (64912) specific to nerve repair with nerve allograft (Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft) and a separate code (+64913) for each additional strand of allograft used in a procedure. Category I CPT codes are used by providers to facilitate payment to the provider (either hospital or ASC) for outpatient procedures. Additionally, Category I CPT codes are used to facilitate payment to the surgeon, for both time spent in outpatient and inpatient procedures. Prior to January 2018, there was no designated Category I CPT code for nerve repair cases that included nerve allograft. To date, the Company has not been able to determine whether there has been either a positive or negative effect as a result of the availability of the new code.\nThe process for securing coding for a product or procedure is separate from the process of securing coverage and establishing a reimbursement payment rate. In the United States, coverage and reimbursement for medical devices vary among payors. In addition, payors review coverage policies on an ongoing basis and can, without notice, change or deny coverage for these new products and procedures. We estimate that commercial payors covering a significant number of U.S. covered lives have legacy non-coverage policies relating to our Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft and our Axoguard\u00ae product lines, designating these products investigational or experimental. Some commercial payors do not currently cover or reimburse our products because they have determined insufficient evidence of favorable clinical outcomes is available. Although some consider the Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft and our Axoguard\u00ae product lines investigational or experimental at this time, these payors may in the future determine sufficient evidence has been developed to cover and reimburse our products and related procedures. We are actively working to reverse these non-coverage decisions but cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. If we are not successful in reversing existing non-coverage policies, or if other third-party payors issue similar policies, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Further, third-party payors who currently cover and reimburse customers for procedures using our products may in the future choose to decrease current levels of reimbursement or eliminate reimbursement altogether, either of which will cause our business to suffer.\nThe amount of reimbursement received by our customers from third-party payors is dependent generally on fee schedules established by these payors for the existing CPT codes. For governmental payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, the fee schedule amount is determined by statutory and regulatory formulas. For commercial payors, the reimbursement amount generally is dependent upon the specific contract terms between the provider and payor. We cannot provide assurance that government or commercial payors will continue to reimburse for procedures with our products using the existing codes, nor can we provide assurance that the payment rates will be adequate. If providers and physicians are unable to obtain reimbursement for the procedure at cost-effective levels when use of our products is included, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Hospitals and ASCs may not purchase our products if they do not receive payment sufficient to cover the cost of our products and related procedures. In addition, in the event that the current coding and/or payment methodology for these procedures changes, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and business operations.\nAxogen may be subject to future product liability litigation which could be expensive and its insurance coverage may not be adequate.\nAlthough Axogen is not currently subject to any product liability proceedings and it has no provision for product liability disbursements, it may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future, including product liability claims arising out of the usage of Axogen products. Although Axogen currently carries product liability insurance in an amount consistent with industry averages, its insurance coverage and any provision it may maintain in the future for product related liabilities may not be adequate and Axogen\u2019s business could suffer material adverse consequences.\nTechnological change could reduce demand for Axogen\u2019s products.\nThe medical technology industry is intensely competitive. Axogen competes with both U.S. and international companies that engage in the development and production of medical technologies and processes including:\n\u00b7\nbiotechnology, orthopedic, pharmaceutical, biomaterial, chemical and other companies;\n\u00b7\nacademic and scientific institutions; and\n\u00b7\npublic and private research organizations.\nAxogen products compete with autograft, hollow-tube conduits, commercially available wraps and amnion products, as well as with alternative medical procedures. For the foreseeable future, Axogen believes a significant number of surgeons will continue to choose to perform autograft procedures when feasible, despite the necessity of performing a second operation and its drawbacks. In addition, many members of the medical community will continue to prefer the use of hollow-tube conduits due in part to their familiarity with these products and the procedures required for their use. Amnion products are widely available and Axogen may not be able to distinguish the Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane from such other products so as to produce significant revenue from its distribution. Also, steady improvements have been made in synthetic human tissue substitutes, which could compete with Axogen\u2019s products in the future. Unlike allografts, synthetic tissue technologies are not dependent on the availability of human or animal tissue. Although Axogen\u2019s growth strategy contemplates the introduction of new technologies, the development of these technologies is a complex and uncertain process, requiring a high level of innovation, as well as the ability to accurately predict future technology and market trends. Axogen may not be able to respond effectively to technological changes and emerging industry standards, or to successfully identify, develop or support new technologies or enhancements to existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all. There can be no assurance that in the future Axogen\u2019s competitors will not develop products that have superior performance or are less expensive relative to Axogen\u2019s products rendering Axogen\u2019s products obsolete or noncompetitive. In this regard, Integra and Baxter have each announced that they will provide a new product consisting of a hollow tube conduit filled with material which they suggest is superior to their current hollow conduit products. Due to Axogen\u2019s limited resources, its smaller size and its relatively early stage, Axogen may face competitive challenges from these new products or existing products and barriers that are difficult to overcome and could negatively impact its growth. Finally, a Chinese company provides a human peripheral nerve allograft in China, however, such product is not sold in markets of interest of Axogen because of Axogen\u2019s IP protection in its identified markets.\nAxogen may be unsuccessful in commercializing its products outside the U.S.\nTo date, Axogen has focused its commercialization efforts in the U.S., except for minor revenues in certain countries outside the U.S. Axogen intends to expand distribution and sales in these and other countries outside the U.S. and will need to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, including obtaining the requisite approvals to do so. The regulatory environment for Axogen\u2019s portfolio of products is complex. Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft is distributed in Canada, United Kingdom, and certain other countries. Distribution in Spain currently allows only for compassionate use and Axogen is proceeding with the regulatory submission process in Germany. Axogen is not seeking approval for France and Italy at this time. Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane is currently available in the U.S. and select other countries for expansion. Cook Biotech is currently renewing the Axoguard\u00a9 product CE Mark and until such renewal Axogen can only sell those Axoguard products that are currently in inventory in the E.U., which inventory may not be sufficient to\nsatisfy all product sales prior to obtaining the renewal. In addition, the United Kingdom voted to exit the E.U. (\u201cBrexit\u201d) and Axogen cannot be sure what changes could occur or the cost of regulatory compliance with both the United Kingdom and E.U. Until such time as Axogen can obtain, if at all, the necessary registrations and approvals for its products, material expansion beyond the United States will be limited. Finally, the cost of regulatory compliance for sales outside the U.S. can be significant and time consuming.\nAdditionally, Axogen will need to either enter into distribution agreements with third parties or develop a direct sales force in foreign markets. If it does not obtain adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payers outside of the U.S., it may be unable to develop and grow its revenue internationally. Outside of the U.S., reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Many ex-U.S. markets have government-managed healthcare systems that govern reimbursement for medical devices, implants and procedures. Additionally, some ex-U.S. reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods. If Axogen is unable to successfully commercialize its products internationally, its long-term growth prospects may be limited.\nIf Axogen does not manage tissue and tissue donation in an effective and efficient manner, it could adversely affect its business.\nMany factors affect the supply, quantity and timing of donor medical releases, such as effectiveness of donor screening, the effective recovery of tissue, the timely receipt, recording, review and approval of required medical and testing documentation, and employee loss and turnover in Axogen\u2019s and its contractor\u2019s recovery department. Axogen can provide no assurance that tissue recovery or donor medical releases will occur at levels that will maximize processing efficiency and minimize Axogen\u2019s costs.\nIf Axogen does not manage product inventory in an effective and efficient manner, it could adversely affect profitability.\nMany factors affect the efficient use and planning of product inventory, such as effectiveness of predicting demand, effectiveness of preparing manufacturing to meet demand, efficiently meeting product mix and product demand requirements and product expiration. Axogen may be unable to manage its inventory efficiently, keep inventory within expected budget goals, keep its work-in-process inventory on hand or manage it efficiently, control expired product or keep sufficient product on hand to meet demand. Finally, Axogen can provide no assurance that it can keep inventory costs within its target levels. Failure to do so may harm long term growth prospects.\nAxogen\u2019s failure to protect its technology systems and comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against Axogen, and adversely impact Axogen\u2019s operating results.\nWe rely on information technology systems, including technology from third party vendors, to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations.\nIn the U.S., federal and state privacy and security laws require certain of our operations to protect the confidentiality of personal information including patient medical records and other health information. E.U. member states and other foreign jurisdictions, including Switzerland, have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. Moreover, the collection and use of personal health data in the E.U., which was formerly governed by the provisions of the E.U. Data Protection Directive, was replaced with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in May 2018. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several\nrequirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the E.U. to the United States, provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The recent implementation of the GDPR has increased Axogen\u2019s responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that Axogen processes, including in clinical trials, and Axogen may in the future be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management's attention and increase Axogen\u2019s cost of doing business. In addition, new regulation or legislative actions regarding data privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase Axogen\u2019s costs of doing business. In this regard, Axogen expects that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the United States, the E.U. and other jurisdictions, and Axogen cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on its business.\nAxogen\u2019s management has broad discretion in the use of Axogen\u2019s cash and cash equivalents and, despite management\u2019s efforts, cash and cash equivalents may be used in a manner that does not increase the value of shareholders\u2019 investments.\nAxogen\u2019s management has broad discretion in the use of Axogen\u2019s cash and cash equivalents, and investors must rely on the judgment of management regarding the use of such cash and cash equivalents. Management may invest Axogen\u2019s cash and cash equivalents in short-term or long-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield favorable returns to shareholders. If Axogen does not invest or apply its cash and cash equivalents in ways that enhance shareholder value, Axogen may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause its stock price to decline.\nAxogen incurs costs as a result of operating as a public company, and its management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, Axogen incurs legal, accounting and other expenses to comply with relevant securities laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the requirement of establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Axogen\u2019s management devotes substantial time and financial resources to these compliance initiatives. Failure to comply with public company requirements could have a material adverse effect on Axogen\u2019s business. In addition, activity by shareholders or others that bring into question aspects of Axogen\u2019s business or financial reporting, whether based on facts or baseless and contrived for individual economic gain, can have a negative impact on the price of Axogen\u2019s stock and can result in substantial time and financial resources being expended to address the situation.\nOur business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal controls are not effective.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that public companies conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, each year we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting and our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning it.\nIn our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported material weaknesses in our internal control as of December 31, 2016 relating to the design and operation of key controls around the calculations of significant judgment and estimates and quarterly cycle count procedures related to consigned inventories. These control deficiencies did not result in any changes of prior period financial statements or previously released financial results. We believe we took appropriate actions to remediate the control deficiencies we identified in these instances.\nAlthough we have taken actions to correct the control deficiencies we identified and to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that we will not discover other material weaknesses in the future or that no material weakness will result from any difficulties, errors, delays or disruptions while we implement and transition to new internal systems. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could result in errors in our\nfinancial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify these or other internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business and our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities.\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters (such as hurricanes and other natural disasters), terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact Axogen directly as a result of damage to our facilities or by preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course, or indirectly as a result of their impact on our customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region.\nAxogen\u2019s ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of disasters or terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment in which Axogen Operates\nAxogen\u2019s business is subject to continuing regulatory compliance by the FDA and other authorities which is costly and could result in negative effects on its business.\nAxogen is subject to extensive regulation by foreign and domestic government entities, including compliance with regulations governing appropriate relationships with healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals and those to whom and through whom we may market our products. We are subject to various federal, state and territorial laws in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These include, for example, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, health care fraud laws, and anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Violations of these laws can be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws are administered by, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, state attorneys general, and their respective counterparts in the applicable foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years. There can also be changes to the regulations by foreign and domestic government entities that require Axogen to update or upgrade business processes or to perform additional validation activities for product or processes. Compliance with such changes can be costly to implement or result in non-compliance, thus restricting the ability to distribute tissue or sell products that could have a material adverse effect.\nOur products are also subject to regulation by the FDA in the U.S. The FDA regulates the development, clinical testing, marketing, distribution, manufacturing, labeling, and promotion of biological products, such as that of Axogen\u2019s Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft product. The FDA requires the approval of a biological product, like Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft, through a BLA prior to marketing. Although Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft product has not yet been approved by FDA through a BLA, FDA is permitting the product to be distributed, subject to FDA enforcement discretion, provided that Axogen: (1) transitions to compliance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act, the cGMP regulations in 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and the applicable regulations and standards in 21 CFR Parts 600-610 prior to initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial designed to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft; (2) conducts a phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety, purity and potency of Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft under an SPA; (3) continues to comply with the requirements of 21 CFR Part 1271; and (4) exercises due diligence in executing the transition plan. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulations - U.S. Government Regulation Review.\u201d\nAvive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane is processed and distributed in accordance with FDA requirements for Human Cellular and Tissue-based Products (HCT/P) under 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations and U.S. State regulations. The FDA also regulates medical devices, for example the Axoguard\u00ae products, and requires them to be cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process prior to marketing. The FDA\u2019s premarket review process for new and modified existing devices that precedes product marketing can be time consuming and expensive. Some of the future products and enhancements to such products that Axogen expects to develop and market may require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that clearance or approval will be granted with respect to any of Axogen\u2019s device products or enhancements of marketed products or that Axogen\u2019s Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft will meet FDA\u2019s requirements for continued marketing and transition to a BLA or ultimately an approved BLA. FDA review of Axogen\u2019s devices or biological products may encounter significant delays during FDA\u2019s premarket review process that would adversely affect Axogen\u2019s ability to market its products or enhancements. In addition, there can be no assurance that Axogen products, including the Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft, or enhancements will not be subject to a lengthy and expensive approval process with the FDA.\nIt is possible that if regulatory clearances or approvals to market a product are obtained from the FDA, the clearances or approvals may contain limitations on the indicated uses of such product and other uses may be prohibited. Product approvals by the FDA can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. Furthermore, the FDA could limit or prevent the distribution of Axogen products and the FDA has the power to require the recall of such products. FDA regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation, and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the FDA or other regulatory bodies will not adversely affect Axogen\u2019s operations. Axogen, and its facilities, may be inspected by the FDA from time to time to determine whether it is in compliance with various regulations relating to specifications, development, documentation, validation, testing, quality control and product labeling. A determination that Axogen is in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of civil penalties, including fines, product recalls or product seizures and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions.\nThe use, misuse or off-label use of Axogen\u2019s products may harm its reputation or the image of its products in the marketplace, or result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to Axogen\u2019s business or result in FDA sanctions if the company is deemed to have engaged in off-label promotion. Axogen is seeking a biologics license through the BLA process for specific uses of Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft under specific circumstances. Its promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA requirements and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition against off-label promotion. Axogen\u2019s promotion of the Axoguard\u00ae products, which are regulated as medical devices, also must comply with FDA\u2019s requirements and must only use labeling that is consistent with the specific indication(s) for use included in the FDA substantial equivalence order that results in marketing the devices. Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane is processed and distributed in accordance with FDA requirements for (HCT/P) under 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations and is to be dispensed only by or on the order of a licensed physician and is contraindicated for use in any patient in whom soft tissue implants are contraindicated. The FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s use of a medical product within the practice of medicine, and Axogen cannot prevent a physician from using its products for an off-label use. However, the FD&C Act and the FDA\u2019s regulations restrict the kind of promotional communications that may be made about Axogen\u2019s products and if the FDA determines that Axogen\u2019s promotional or training materials constitute the unlawful promotion of an off-label use, it could request that Axogen modify its training or promotional materials and/or subject the Company to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, civil money penalties, seizure, injunction or criminal fines and penalties. Other federal, state or foreign governmental authorities might also take action if they consider Axogen promotion or training materials to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement, or exclusion from participation in federal health programs. In that event, Axogen\u2019s reputation could be damaged and the use of its products in the marketplace could be impaired.\nIn addition, there may be increased risk of injury if physicians or others attempt to use Axogen products off-label. Furthermore, the use of Axogen\u2019s product for indications other than those for which its products have been approved, cleared or licensed by the FDA may not effectively treat the conditions not referenced in product indications, which\ncould harm Axogen\u2019s reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients. Physicians may also misuse Axogen\u2019s product or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained in the particular use, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention from its primary business and result in substantial damage awards against Axogen. Any of these events could harm Axogen\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAxogen\u2019s Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft product is currently allowed to be distributed pursuant to a transition plan with the FDA and a change in position by the FDA regarding its use of enforcement discretion to permit the sale of Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft would have a material adverse effect on Axogen.\nThe FDA considers Axogen\u2019s Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft product to be a biological product, subject to BLA approval requirements. Although the Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft product has not yet been approved by FDA through a BLA, Axogen\u2019s Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft product is currently distributed under the controls applicable to a HCT/P pursuant to Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271 of FDA\u2019s regulations, subject to FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion and Axogen\u2019s compliance with a transition plan established by the FDA. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulations - U.S. Government Regulation Review.\u201d Axogen has continued to communicate with the CBER since the acceptance of the transition plan on clinical trial design, preclinical studies, Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (\u201cCMC\u201d) for Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft, and other issues related to the effective IND. Subject to the FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion, Axogen can commercially distribute Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft until the FDA makes a final determination on an Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft BLA submission, assuming Axogen remains in compliance with the transition plan and exercises due diligence in executing the transition plan. In the event that the FDA becomes dissatisfied with Axogen\u2019s progress or actions with respect to the transition plan or the FDA changes its position for any reason regarding its use of enforcement discretion to permit Axogen to distribute Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft product in accordance with the transition plan, Axogen would no longer be able to distribute Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft, which would have a material adverse effect on Axogen\u2019s operations and financial viability. In addition, if Axogen does not meet the conditions of the transition plan, or fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA could impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures, injunctions or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions. These consequences also would have a material adverse effect on Axogen\u2019s operations and financial viability.\nAxogen\u2019s business is subject to continuing compliance to standards by various accreditation and registration bodies which is costly and loss of accreditation or registration could result in negative effects on its business.\nAxogen is subject to accreditation such as that by the AATB and as a Verified-Accredited Wholesale Distributor by National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. Axogen has registration requirements such as that with ISO 13485 registration bodies. These accreditations and regulations can affect distribution and sale of Axogen products on a state-by-state basis, within the United States and also affects distribution and sale of Axogen products outside of the United States. The loss of accreditation or registration could keep Axogen from selling and distributing its products which may have negative effects on its business.\nAxogen\u2019s Axoguard\u00ae and Avive\u00ae products are subject to FDA and other regulatory requirements.\nAxogen\u2019s Axoguard\u00ae product line is regulated as a medical device under the FD&C Act and subject to premarket notification and clearance requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation) and other FDA regulations. Axogen distributes for Cook Biotech the Axoguard\u00ae product line and Cook Biotech is responsible for the regulatory compliance of the Axoguard\u00ae Connector and Protector product lines. Cook Biotech has obtained a 510(k) premarket clearance for Axoguard\u00ae Nerve Connector from the FDA for porcine (pig) small intestine submucosa for the repair of peripheral nerve transections where gap closure can be achieved by flexion of the extremity. Cook Biotech has also obtained a 510(k) premarket clearance for Axoguard\u00ae Nerve Protector for the repair of peripheral nerve damage in which there is no gap or where a gap closure is achieved by flexion of the extremity. Axogen is responsible for the regulatory compliance of the Axoguard\u00ae Nerve Cap. Axogen has obtained a 510(k) premarket clearance for Axoguard\u00ae Nerve Cap to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment and to prevent or to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma. If Axogen or Cook Biotech fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA could deny or withdraw\n510(k) clearance for the Axoguard\u00ae products, or impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions.\nAvive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane is processed and distributed in accordance with U.S. FDA requirements for Human Cellular and Tissue-based Products (361 HCT/P) and as such, complies with 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations, U.S. State regulations and the guidelines of the American Association of Tissue Banks (\u201cAATB\u201d). FDA could determine that Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane should be regulated under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act and cannot be marketed without a BLA. If so, FDA could take enforcement action including requiring that AxoGen remove the product from the market until a BLA is approved. If Axogen fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA could also impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions.\nAxogen\u2019s Axotouch\u00ae and Acroval\u00ae products are subject to FDA and other regulatory requirements.\nAxogen\u2019s Axotouch\u00ae and Acroval\u00ae products are regulated as medical devices under the FD&C Act and subject to premarket notification and clearance requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation) and other FDA regulations. If Axogen fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA could deny or withdraw 510(k) clearance for these products, or impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions.\nDefective Axogen product could lead to recall or other negative business conditions.\nIf Axogen\u2019s products are defective or otherwise pose safety risks, the FDA could require their recall or Axogen may initiate a voluntary recall of its products. The FDA may require recall of a marketed medical device product, such as the Axoguard\u00ae products, in the event that it determines the medical device presents a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death. However, most device recalls do not rise to this level of health significance and result from voluntary action. The FDA has authority to recall biological products when a batch, lot or other quantity of the product presents an imminent or substantial hazard to the public health. However, in such circumstances, the FDA usually initially requests voluntary recalls of biological products, such as the Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft. If a company does not comply with an FDA request for a recall, the FDA can order one under the above-referenced circumstances or take other enforcement actions, such as product seizure. In addition, manufacturers may, on their own initiative, recall a product to remove or correct a deficiency or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may pose a risk to health. A government-mandated, government-requested or voluntary recall could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, reports of safety issues, failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls and other field corrections for any of Axogen\u2019s products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. A recall could harm Axogen\u2019s reputation with customers and negatively affect its sales. Axogen may initiate recalls involving some of its products in the future that it determines do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA were to disagree with Axogen\u2019s determinations, it could request that it report those actions as recalls, and take regulatory or enforcement action against Axogen or the product.\nIf Axogen\u2019s products cause or contribute to a death, a serious injury or any adverse reaction involving a communicable disease related to its products, or malfunction in certain ways, it will be subject to reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Education Grants, U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws - Pervasive and False Claims.\u201d If Axogen fails to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take regulatory or enforcement action against Axogen. Any adverse event involving Axogen\u2019s products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as Axogen defending itself in a lawsuit, would require the dedication of time and capital, distract management from operating its business, and may harm Axogen\u2019s reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAxogen\u2019s operations must comply with FDA and other governmental requirements.\nAxogen\u2019s operations require it to comply with the FDA\u2019s and other governmental authorities\u2019 laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and production of medical products, which is costly and could subject Axogen to enforcement action. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulations - Education Grants, U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws - Fraud, Abuse and False Claims\u201d. Any of these actions could impair Axogen\u2019s ability to produce its products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet customer demands. Axogen may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have an adverse impact on its future revenue and its ability to generate profits. Furthermore, Axogen\u2019s key material suppliers, licensors and or other contractors may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in Axogen\u2019s failure to produce its products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nDistribution of Axogen human tissue products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. In the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), human tissue regulations, if applicable, differ from one E.U. member state to the next. Because of the absence of a harmonized regulatory framework and the proposed regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products in the E.U., as well as for other countries, the approval process for human derived cell or tissue based medical products may be extensive, lengthy, expensive and unpredictable. Axogen products will be subject to E.U. member states\u2019 regulations that govern the donation, procurement, testing, coding, traceability, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells and cellular or tissue-based products. In addition, some E.U. member states have their own tissue banking regulations. The inability to meet foreign regulatory requirements could materially affect Axogen\u2019s future growth and compliance with such requirements could place a significant financial burden on Axogen.\nIn addition, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) and the timing and scope remain unclear. To date there is no business disruption, but Axogen cannot be sure what changes could occur.. The cost of regulatory compliance with both the United Kingdom and E.U. could be significant and time consuming.\nFinally, regulations in both the United States and other countries are subject to constant change. There can be no assurance that Axogen can meet the requirements of future regulations or that compliance with current regulations assures future capability to distribute and sell its products.\nClinical trials can be long, expensive and results are ultimately uncertain which could jeopardize Axogen\u2019s ability to obtain regulatory approval and continue to market its Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft product.\nAxogen is required to perform a clinical trial for its Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft under FDA\u2019s statutory requirements to obtain approval of a BLA for the product. This trial is expensive, is expected to take several years to execute, and is subject to factors within and outside of Axogen\u2019s control. The outcome of this trial is uncertain.\nAxogen submitted for RECON an IND for the Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft in April 2013 and received FDA approval in March 2015. The phase 3 clinical trial was initiated in the second quarter of 2015. The RECON study is designed to assess the outcome of peripheral nerve repair in approximately 170 subjects in up to 20 centers. The study completed initial subject enrollment in January 2019. No outcome data is available at this time. As required by the SPA and agreed to by FDA and Axogen, an independent statistical analysis was conducted to determine if greater study enrollment is appropriate to maintain the planned statistical power of the study. Axogen is working with FDA to review the interim analysis findings and obtain agreement on the next study phase. If additional enrollment results from these discussions an amended IND will be filed. Any such changes will increase the time and cost of RECON and extend the timeframe for final determination of Axogen\u2019s BLA submission.\nAxogen is working to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations by having ongoing discussions on the transition of the quality system to 21 CFR Parts 210/211 and 600-610 regulations with the FDA. Final determination of regulatory compliance with 21 CFR Parts 210/211 and 600-610 will be made during FDA\u2019s pre-license inspection as part of the BLA review. If the FDA is unable to agree with Axogen, or Axogen is unable to meet the standards required of it by the FDA, regarding preclinical studies, clinical studies and CMC, the approval of Axogen\u2019s BLA would not occur or be delayed.\nAxogen continues to work diligently with the FDA and, in this context, continues to distribute the Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft products. The FDA will end the period of enforcement discretion upon a final determination of Axogen\u2019s BLA submission or if the FDA finds that Axogen does not meet the conditions for the transition plan or is not exercising due diligence in executing the transition (e.g., not progressing toward study completion or BLA submission in a timely or adequate fashion). If final action on the BLA is negative or Axogen is found to not meet the conditions for the transition plan or its execution, Axogen will not be able to continue to distribute Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft, and Axogen\u2019s business and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nThe results of non-clinical studies do not necessarily predict future clinical trial results and predecessor clinical trial results may not be repeated in subsequent clinical trials. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with Axogen\u2019s interpretation of the data from its non-clinical studies and clinical trials and may require the company to pursue additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, or not approve Axogen\u2019s BLA. If Axogen is unable to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of its product through its clinical trials, it will be unable to obtain regulatory approval to market the Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft and will not be able to continue to provide it.\nAxogen will rely on third parties to conduct its clinical trial and they may not perform as contractually required or expected.\nAxogen will rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct its clinical trial and certain nonclinical studies. Axogen and its CROs are required to comply with all applicable regulations governing clinical research, including good clinical practice, or GCP. The FDA enforces these regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, CROs and trial sites. If Axogen or its CROs fail to comply with applicable FDA regulations, the data generated in its clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require Axogen to perform additional clinical trials before approving its applications. Axogen cannot be certain that, upon inspection, the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities will determine that Axogen\u2019s clinical trial complies or complied with clinical trial regulations, including GCP. In addition, Axogen\u2019s clinical trial must be conducted with product produced under applicable cGMP regulations. Failure to comply with the clinical trial regulations may require Axogen to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to Axogen\u2019s clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, Axogen\u2019s non-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and it would not be able to obtain regulatory approval for its products on a timely basis, if at all, and its business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects would be adversely affected. Furthermore, Axogen\u2019s third party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting its clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.\nU.S. governmental regulation could restrict the use of Axogen\u2019s Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft and Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane product, restrict Axogen\u2019s procurement of tissue or increase costs.\nIn addition to the FDA requirements for biological products, Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft will continue to be subject to, as is Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane, various requirements for human tissue under 21 CFR Part 1271 controls. Human tissues intended for transplantation have been regulated by the FDA since 1993. In May 2005, three new comprehensive regulations went into effect that address manufacturing activities associated with HCT/P. The first regulation requires that companies that produce and distribute HCT/Ps register with the FDA. The second regulation provides criteria that must be met for donors to be eligible to donate tissues and is referred to as the \u201cDonor Eligibility\u201d rule. The third regulation governs the processing and distribution of the tissues and is often referred to as the \u201cCurrent Good Tissue Practices\u201d rule. The Current Good Tissue Practices rule covers all stages of allograft processing, from procurement of tissue to distribution of final allografts. Together, the three basic requirements of 21 CFR Part 1271 are designed to ensure that sound, high quality practices are followed to reduce the risk of tissue contamination and of communicable disease transmission to recipients. These regulations increased regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which Axogen operates and have led to increased enforcement actions, which affects the conduct of its business. In addition, new guidance was issued by the FDA in late 2017 on Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and\nTissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use and FDA Commissioner Gottlieb has publicly announced that other guidance for cell and gene therapy products are forthcoming. FDA actions interpreting these guidance will need to be followed closely, and the potential implications on the regulatory status of Avive\u00ae and future HCT/P products is being evaluated by the Company.\nAdditional regulations or guidance documents may be implemented by the FDA in the future. These changes may require new documentation requirements, process changes or testing that could increase costs and regulatory burden. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulations.\u201d These regulations can also increase the cost of tissue recovery activities. Finally, Avance\u00ae Nerve Graft and Avive\u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane are subject to certain state and local regulations, as well as compliance with the standards of the tissue bank industry\u2019s accrediting organization, the AATB.\nThe procurement and transplantation of allograft nerve tissue is also subject to federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act (\u201cNOTA\u201d), a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation, including nerve and related tissue, for \u201cvaluable consideration.\u201d NOTA only permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human nerve tissue. Axogen makes payments to certain of its clients and tissue banks for their services related to recovering allograft nerve and umbilical cord tissue on its behalf. If NOTA is interpreted or enforced in a manner which prevents Axogen from receiving payment for services it renders, or which prevents it from paying tissue banks or certain of its clients for the services they render for Axogen, its business could be materially and adversely affected.\nAxogen has engaged, through its marketing employees, independent sales agents and sales representatives in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to the benefits of Axogen products, and Axogen intends to continue its educational activities. Although Axogen believes that NOTA permits payments in connection with these educational efforts as reasonable payments associated with the processing, transportation and implantation of Axogen products, payments in connection with such education efforts are not exempt from NOTA\u2019s restrictions and Axogen\u2019s inability to make such payments in connection with its education efforts may prevent it from paying Axogen sales representatives for their education efforts and could adversely affect Axogen\u2019s business and prospects. No federal agency or court has determined whether NOTA is, or will be, applicable to every allograft nerve tissue-based material which Axogen\u2019s processing technologies may generate. Assuming that NOTA applies to Axogen\u2019s processing of allograft nerve and umbilical cord tissue, Axogen believes that it complies with NOTA, but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of, or amendments to, NOTA will not be adopted in the future, which would call into question one or more aspects of Axogen\u2019s method of operations.\nOther regulatory entities include state agencies with statutes covering tissue banking. Regulations issued by Florida, New York, California and Maryland, among other states, are particularly relevant to Axogen\u2019s business. Most states do not currently have tissue banking regulations. However, incidents of allograft related issues in the industry may stimulate the development of regulation in other states. It is possible that third parties may make allegations against Axogen or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks about non-compliance with applicable FDA regulations or other relevant statutes or regulations. Allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action, or could cause negative publicity for Axogen\u2019s business and the industry in which it operates.\nHealthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on Axogen.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), which Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and encourages improvements in the quality of healthcare items and services. While implementation of the Act has been uneven, several provisions significantly impact the biotechnology and medical device industries and could have a material adverse impact on numerous aspects of Axogen\u2019s business.\nThis Act includes, among other things, the following measures:\n\u00b7\na 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S., with limited exceptions, beginning in 2013, referred to as the Device Tax, which has been suspended through 2019;\n\u00b7\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research;\n\u00b7\nreporting and disclosure requirements on healthcare manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as reporting of certain physician ownership interests (\u201cSunshine Act\u201d);\n\u00b7\npayment system reforms, including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and\n\u00b7\na new abbreviated pathway for the licensure of biologic products that are demonstrated to be biosimilar or biosimilar and interchangeable with a licensed biologic product.\nThere are also a number of states (such as Vermont, Massachusetts, Minnesota) with their own Sunshine Acts that implement the reporting and disclosure requirements on healthcare manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as reporting of certain physician ownership interests.\nIn the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices Axogen is able to charge for its products or the amounts of reimbursement available for its products and could also limit the acceptance and availability of its products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on Axogen\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector in the U.S. and elsewhere to limit the growth of healthcare costs, especially for drugs and biologics, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where Axogen does business. Axogen could experience an adverse impact on operating results due to increased pricing pressure in the U.S. and in other markets. Governments, hospitals, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and other third-party payors could reduce the amount of approved reimbursement for Axogen\u2019s products, deny coverage altogether, or impose new requirements on manufacturers to justify their prices. Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect Axogen\u2019s future operating results.\nRisks Related to Axogen\u2019s Intellectual Property\nFailure to protect Axogen\u2019s IP rights could result in costly and time-consuming litigation and its loss of any potential competitive advantage.\nAxogen\u2019s success will depend, to a large extent, on its ability to successfully obtain and maintain patents, prevent misappropriation or infringement of IP, maintain trade secret protection, and conduct operations without violating or infringing on the IP rights of third parties. See \u201cBusiness - Intellectual Property.\u201d There can be no assurance that Axogen\u2019s patented and patent-pending technologies will provide it with a competitive advantage, that Axogen will be able to develop or acquire additional technology that is patentable, or that third parties will not develop and offer technologies which are similar to Axogen\u2019s. Moreover, Axogen can provide no assurance that confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants and other parties, trade secrecy agreements or similar agreements intended to protect unpatented technology or prevent unauthorized use, disclosure, or misappropriation will not be breached by those third parties. IP litigation is extremely expensive and time-consuming, and it is often difficult, if not impossible, to predict the outcome of such litigation. A failure by Axogen to protect its IP, or a breach by third parties of agreements aimed at protecting Axogen\u2019s IP, could have a materially adverse effect on its business and operating results and its ability to successfully compete in its industry.\nFuture protection for Axogen\u2019s proprietary rights is uncertain which may impact its ability to successfully compete in its industry.\nThe degree of future protection for Axogen\u2019s proprietary rights is uncertain. Axogen cannot ensure that:\n\u00b7\nit, or its licensors, were the first to make the inventions covered by each of Axogen\u2019s patents;\n\u00b7\nit, or its licensors, were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of Axogen\u2019s technologies;\n\u00b7\nany of Axogen\u2019s pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u00b7\nany of Axogen\u2019s issued patents or those of its licensors are valid and enforceable;\n\u00b7\nany patents issued to Axogen or its collaborators will provide any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7\nit will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7\nthe patents of others will not have a material adverse effect on our business rights; or\n\u00b7\nthe measures Axogen relies on to protect its IP underlying its products are adequate to prevent third parties from using, disclosing or misappropriating that IP, all of which could harm its ability to compete in the market.\nAxogen\u2019s commercial success depends in part on its ability and the ability of its collaborators and licensors to avoid infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties which could expose it to litigation or commercially unfavorable licensing arrangements. Third parties may accuse Axogen or collaborators and licensors of employing their proprietary technology in Axogen products, or in the materials or processes used to make Axogen products, without authorization. Any legal action against Axogen collaborators, licensors or it claiming damages and/or seeking to enjoin Axogen\u2019s commercial activities relating to the affected products, materials and processes could, in addition to subjecting Axogen to potential liability for damages, require it or its collaborators and licensors to obtain a license to continue to utilize the affected materials or processes or to manufacture or market the affected products. Axogen cannot predict whether it or its collaborators and licensors would prevail in any of these actions or whether any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If Axogen were unable to obtain such a license, it and its collaborators and licensors may be unable to continue to utilize the affected materials or processes, or manufacture or market the affected products, or Axogen may be obligated by a court to pay substantial royalties and/or other damages to the patent holder. Even if Axogen were able to obtain such a license, the terms of such a license could substantially reduce the commercial value of the affected product or products and impair Axogen\u2019s prospects for profitability. Accordingly, Axogen cannot predict whether, or to what extent, the commercial value of the affected product or products or Axogen\u2019s prospects for profitability may be harmed as a result of any of the liabilities discussed above. Furthermore, infringement and other IP claims, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and can divert management\u2019s attention from its core business. Axogen and its licensors may be unable to obtain and enforce IP rights to adequately protect its products and related IP.\nThe patent protection for our products may expire before we are able to maximize their commercial value which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenue.\nThe patents for our commercialized products and products in development have varying expiration dates and, when these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition and we may not be able to recover our development costs. For example, the material U.S. patents covering the formulations used in our Axoguard\u00ae product line, which are held by Cook Biotech, have expired. Expiration of these patents could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our business strategy to maximize the value of Axoguard\u00ae products and could negatively impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nOthers may claim an ownership interest in Axogen IP which could expose it to litigation and have a significant adverse effect on its prospects.\nA third party may claim an ownership interest in one or more of Axogen\u2019s patents or other IP. A third party could bring legal actions against Axogen claiming it infringes their patents or proprietary rights, and seek monetary damages\nand/or enjoin clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the affected product or products. While Axogen believes it owns the right, title and interest in the patents for which it or its licensors have applied and Axogen\u2019s other IP (including that which is licensed from third parties), and is presently unaware of any claims or assertions by third-parties with respect to Axogen\u2019s patents or IP, it cannot guarantee that a third party will not assert a claim or an interest in any of such patents or IP. If Axogen becomes involved in any litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of Axogen\u2019s resources and cause a significant diversion of effort by Axogen\u2019s technical and management personnel regardless of the outcome of the litigation. If any of these actions were successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, Axogen could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the affected product, in which case Axogen may be required to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to Axogen\u2019s patents. Axogen cannot, however, assure you that any such license will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Ultimately, Axogen could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of its business operations as a result of claims of patent infringement or violation of other IP rights, which could have a material and adverse effect on Axogen\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, the outcome of IP litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance, including the demeanor and credibility of witnesses and the identity of the adverse party. This is especially true in IP cases that may turn on the testimony of experts as to technical facts or the scope or meaning of patent claims upon which experts may reasonably disagree.\nAxogen depends on maintenance of exclusive licenses.\nAxogen depends fundamentally on keeping and satisfying the terms of exclusive licenses of its nerve repair technologies from UFRF and UTA. Nonetheless, a disagreement between Axogen and either licensor could have a negative impact on its ability to operate its business effectively. In addition, Axogen could learn that the technologies it has licensed do not perform as purported, are not efficacious, or are not the property of the licensor, any of which would have an immediate and negative impact on Axogen\u2019s business.\nAxogen trademarks are valuable\nIn the U.S. and other countries, we currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks to protect our brand and, in part, differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks, including trade dress, that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market in our common stock may not be maintained.\nThe trading market in our common stock has been extremely volatile. The quotation of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market will exist. We cannot predict whether an active market for our common stock will be maintained in the future. An absence of an active trading market could adversely affect our shareholders\u2019 ability to sell our common stock at current market prices in short time periods, or possibly at all. Additionally, market visibility for our common stock may be limited and such lack of visibility may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 7.41% of our outstanding shares of common stock was held by our officers, directors, beneficial owners of 5% or more of our securities and their respective affiliates, which adversely affects the liquidity of the trading market for our common stock, in as much as federal securities laws restrict sales of our shares by these shareholders. If our affiliates continue to hold their shares of common stock, there will be limited trading volume in our common stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares or increase the volatility of our stock price.\nThe price of Axogen\u2019s common stock could be highly volatile due to a number of factors, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cAXGN.\u201d The stock market in general, and the market for medical technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The trading price of our common stock has experienced substantial volatility and is likely to continue to be highly volatile in response to a number of factors including, without limitation, the following:\n\u00b7\nlimited daily trading volume resulting in the lack of a liquid market;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in price and volume due to investor speculation and other factors that may not be tied to the financial performance of Axogen;\n\u00b7\nperformance by Axogen in the execution of its business plan;\n\u00b7\nfinancial viability;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of developments by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in our industry;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nadoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nperformance of products sold and advertised by licensees in the marketplace;\n\u00b7\neconomic and other external factors;\n\u00b7\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in financial results; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, including the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, and several recent situations, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has been initiated against such company. Axogen has experienced such situation and is subject to a class action. Litigation initiated against us, including that which we are currently involved, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nOn January 9, 2019, Plaintiff Neil Einhorn, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, filed a putative class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws against Axogen, Inc., certain of its directors and officers (\u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d), and Axogen\u2019s 2017 Offering Underwriters and 2018 Offering Underwriters (collectively, with the Individual Defendants, the \u201cDefendants\u201d), captioned Einhorn v. Axogen, Inc., et al., No. 8:19-cv-00069 (M.D. Fl.). Plaintiff asserts that Defendants made false or misleading statements in connection with the Company\u2019s November 2017 registration statement issued regarding its secondary public offering in November 2017 and May 2018 registration statement issued regarding its secondary public offering in May 2018, and during a class period of August 7, 2017 to December 18, 2018. In particular, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants issued false and misleading statements and failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the Company aggressively increased prices to mask lower sales; (2) that the Company\u2019s pricing alienated customers and threatened the Company\u2019s future growth; (3) that ambulatory surgery centers form a significant part of the market for the Company\u2019s products; (4) that such centers were especially sensitive to price increases; (5) that the Company was dependent on a small number of surgeons whom the Company paid to generate sales; (6) that the Company\u2019s consignment model for inventory was reasonably likely to lead to channel stuffing; (7) that the Company offered purchase incentives to sales representatives to encourage channel stuffing; (8) that the Company\u2019s sales representatives were encouraged to backdate revenue to artificially inflate metrics; (9) that the Company lacked adequate internal controls to prevent such channel stuffing and backdating of revenue; (10) that the Company\u2019s key operating metrics, such as number of active accounts, were overstated; and (11) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects, were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. Axogen was served on January 15, 2019. On February 4, 2019, the court granted the parties\u2019 stipulated motion which provided that Axogen is not required to file a response to the complaint until thirty days after Plaintiff files a consolidated amended complaint, which will not occur until thirty days after the court appoints a lead plaintiff and lead counsel.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe operation and expansion of our business will continue to require funding. We do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, if any investor purchases shares of common stock, realization of a gain on such investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in Minnesota law may deter acquisition bids for us that you might consider favorable.\nWe are governed by the provisions of Sections 302A.671, 302A.673 and 302A.675 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the \u201cMBCA\u201d). These provisions may discourage a negotiated acquisition or unsolicited takeover of us and deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their common stock at a premium over the market price.\nIn general, Section 302A.671 of the MBCA provides that a corporation\u2019s shares acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights unless voting rights are approved in a prescribed manner. A \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d is a direct or indirect acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares that would, when added to all other shares beneficially owned by the acquiring person, entitle the acquiring person to have voting power of 20% or more in the election of directors.\nIn general, Section 302A.673 of the MBCA prohibits a public Minnesota corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person\nbecame an interested shareholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The term \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested shareholder. An \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d is a person who is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of a corporation\u2019s voting stock or who is an affiliate or associate of the corporation, and who, at any time within four years before the date in question, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. Section 302A.673 does not apply if a committee of our Board of Directors consisting of all of its disinterested directors (excluding current and former officers) approves the proposed transaction or the interested shareholder\u2019s acquisition of shares before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder.\nIf a tender offer is made for our common stock, Section 302A.675 of the MBCA precludes the offeror from acquiring additional shares of stock (including in acquisitions pursuant to mergers, consolidations or statutory share exchanges) within two years following the completion of the tender offer, unless shareholders selling their shares in the later acquisition are given the opportunity to sell their shares on terms that are substantially the same as those contained in the earlier tender offer. Section 302A.675 does not apply if a committee of our Board of Directors consisting of all of its disinterested directors (excluding its current and former officers) approves the proposed acquisition before any shares are acquired pursuant to the earlier tender offer.", "PERMNO": 10966, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "AXGN"}
