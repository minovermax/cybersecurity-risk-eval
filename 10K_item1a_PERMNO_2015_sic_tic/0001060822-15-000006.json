RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC in evaluating our business. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impact our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our operating results may be affected.\nThe loss of one or more of our major customers could result in a material loss of revenues; financial difficulties for our\nmajor customers or licensees could have a significant impact on us.\nWe derived approximately 25% of our consolidated net sales from our top five customers for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2015. We do not enter into long-term sales contracts with our major customers, relying instead on product performance, long-standing relationships, and on our position in the marketplace. As a result, we face the risk that one or more of these or other customers may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us as a result of\ncompetitive forces, consolidation, reorganization, financial difficulties, including bankruptcy or insolvency, or other reasons, which could result in significant levels of excess inventory, a material decrease in our sales, or material impact on our operating results. Further, a large percentage of our gross accounts receivables are typically from our largest wholesale customers. For example, approximately 75% of our gross accounts receivable at January 3, 2015 were from our ten largest wholesale customers, with five of these customers having individual receivable balances in excess of 10% of our gross accounts receivable. Our reserves for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments may prove not to be sufficient if any one or more of our customers are unable to meet outstanding obligations to us, which could materially adversely affect our operating results. If the financial condition or credit position of one or more of our customers or licensees were to deteriorate, or such customer or licensee fails, or is unable to pay the amounts owed to us in a timely manner, this could have a significant adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe acceptance of our products in the marketplace is affected by consumers\u2019 tastes and preferences, along with fashion\ntrends.\nWe believe that continued success depends on our ability to provide a compelling value proposition for our consumers in the\nCompany's distribution channels. There can be no assurance that the demand for our products will not decline, or that we will\nbe able to successfully and timely evaluate and adapt our products to changes in consumers' tastes and preferences or fashion\ntrends. If our product offerings are not aligned with consumers' tastes and preferences demand for our products may decline,\npromotional pricing may be required to move seasonal merchandise, and our gross margins and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nThe value of our brands, and our sales, could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity, including through actions by our vendors, independent manufacturers and licensees, over whom we have limited control.\nAlthough we maintain policies with our vendors, independent manufacturers and licensees that promote ethical business\npractices and our employees, agents, and third-party compliance auditors periodically visit and monitor the operations of our\nvendors, independent manufacturers, and licensees, we do not control these vendors, independent manufacturers, and licensees, or their labor practices. A violation of our vendor policies, licensee agreements, health and safety standards, labor laws, or other laws by these vendors, independent manufacturers, or licensees could damage the image and reputation of our brands and could subject us to liability. As a result, negative publicity regarding our Company, brands or products, including licensed products, could adversely affect our reputation and sales. Further, while the Company takes steps to ensure the reputation of its brands is maintained through its license agreements, there can be no guarantee that the Company's brand image will not be negatively impacted through its association with products or actions of licensees. In addition, we are subject to certain rules as a public company, such as the conflict minerals rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, that require disclosure of certain activities notwithstanding their compliance with the substantive provisions of applicable law. If we are required to make such disclosures, it is possible that our reputation could be harmed.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive\nposition, and adversely affect our results.\nWe currently rely on a combination of trademark, unfair competition, and copyright laws, as well as licensing arrangements, to\nestablish and protect our intellectual property rights. The steps taken by us or by our licensees to protect our proprietary rights\nmay not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks or proprietary rights by others. In addition, intellectual property\nprotection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect\nour proprietary rights and where third parties may have rights to conflicting marks, and it may be more difficult for us to\nsuccessfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in those countries. If we fail to protect and maintain our\nintellectual property rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. Further, third\nparties may assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business geographically, and any such\nclaim could be expensive and time consuming to defend, regardless of its merit. Successful infringement claims against us\ncould result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products, which could have an adverse\neffect on our results of operations.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of investigations or other proceedings related to previously disclosed\ninvestigations.\nAs previously reported, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the SEC and the United States Attorney's Office began conducting investigations, with which the Company cooperated, related to customer margin support provided by the Company, including undisclosed margin support commitments and related matters. In December 2010, the Company and the SEC entered into a non-prosecution agreement pursuant to which the SEC agreed not to charge the Company with any violations of federal securities laws, commence any enforcement action against the Company, or require the Company to pay any financial penalties in connection with the SEC's investigation of customer margin support provided by the Company, conditioned upon the Company's continued cooperation with the SEC's investigation and with any related proceedings. The Company has incurred and may continue to incur substantial expenses for legal services due to the SEC and United States Attorney's Office investigations and any related proceedings. These matters may continue to divert management's time and attention away from operations. The Company also expects to bear additional costs pursuant to its advancement and indemnification obligations to directors and officers under our organizational documents in connection with proceedings related to these matters. Our insurance does not provide coverage to offset all of the costs incurred in connection with these proceedings.\nThe Company's and its vendors' databases containing personal information and payment card data of our retail store and eCommerce customers, employees and other third parties, could be breached, which could subject us to adverse publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation, and expenses. In addition, if we are unable to comply with security standards created by banks and the payment card industry, our operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on the security of our networks, databases, systems and processes and, in certain circumstances, those of third parties,\nsuch as vendors, to protect our proprietary information and information about our customers, employees, and vendors. Criminals are constantly devising schemes to circumvent information technology security safeguards and other retailers have recently suffered serious data security breaches. If unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases, or those of our vendors, they may be able to steal, publish, delete, or modify our private and sensitive third-party information including credit card information and personal identification information. In addition, employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data or security breaches that result in unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In such circumstances, we could be held liable to our customers, other parties, or employees as well as be subject to regulatory or other actions for breaching privacy law or failing to adequately protect such information. This could result in costly investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties, operational changes or other response measures, loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, and negative publicity that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. Further, if we are unable to comply with the security standards, established by banks and the payment card industry, we may be subject to fines, restrictions, and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could adversely affect our retail operations.\nOur profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.\nThe apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, the promotional retail environment and changes in consumer demand. If these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability could decline. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIncreases in production costs and deflationary pressures on our selling prices may adversely affect our results.\nThe Company's product costs are subject to fluctuations in costs such as manufacturing, cotton, labor, fuel, and transportation. At various time in recent years, we have experienced increased costs of cotton, labor, fuel, and transportation, and have also had higher costs for foreign sourced products as a result of the devaluation of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies. In recent years, the Company experienced deflationary pressure on its selling prices, in part driven by intense price competition in\nthe young children's apparel industry. If future product cost increases are more than anticipated, or if we are unable to offset such cost increases through selling price increases or otherwise, our profitability could be adversely affected. Future deflationary pressures on our selling prices could also adversely affect our profitability.\nOur business is sensitive to overall levels of consumer spending, particularly in the young children's apparel segment.\nConsumers' demand for young children's apparel, specifically brand name apparel products, is impacted by the overall level of\nconsumer spending. Discretionary consumer spending is impacted by employment levels, weather, gasoline and utility costs,\nbusiness conditions, availability of consumer credit, tax rates, interest rates, levels of consumer indebtedness, and overall levels\nof consumer confidence. Recent and further reductions, or lower-than-expected growth, in the level of discretionary spending\nmay have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales and results of operations.\nWe source substantially all of our products through foreign production arrangements. Our dependence on foreign supply\nsources are subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing which could result in disruptions to our operations.\nWe source substantially all of our products through a network of vendors primarily in Asia, principally coordinated by our\nsourcing agents and directly through our Hong Kong sourcing office. The following factors could disrupt our foreign supply chain, increase our cost of goods sold, decrease our gross profit, or impact our ability to get products to our customers:\n\u2022 financial instability, including bankruptcy or insolvency, of one or more of our major vendors;\n\u2022 political instability or other international events resulting in the disruption of trade in foreign countries from which we source our products;\n\u2022 interruptions in the supply of raw materials, including cotton, fabric, and trim items;\n\u2022 increases in the cost of labor in our sourcing locations;\n\u2022 the imposition of new regulations relating to imports, duties, taxes, and other charges on imports;\n\u2022 the occurrence of a natural disaster, unusual weather conditions, or a disease epidemic in foreign countries from which we source our products;\n\u2022 changes in the United States customs procedures concerning the importation of apparel products;\n\u2022 unforeseen delays in customs clearance of any goods;\n\u2022 disruptions in the global transportation network such as a port strike, work stoppages or other labor unrest, capacity withholding, world trade restrictions, acts of terrorism or war;\n\u2022 the application of adverse foreign intellectual property laws;\n\u2022 the ability of our vendors to secure sufficient credit to finance the manufacturing process including the acquisition of\nraw materials;\n\u2022 potential social compliance concerns resulting from our use of international vendors, independent manufacturers and licensees, over whom we have limited control;\n\u2022 manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for products may require the use of faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air-freight services;\n\u2022 compliance with disclosure rules regarding the identification and reporting on the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in our products; and\n\u2022 other events beyond our control that could interrupt our supply chain and delay receipt of our products into the United States.\nOur revenues, product costs and other expenses are subject to foreign economic and currency risks due to our operations outside of the United States.\nWe have operations in Canada and our vendors, independent manufacturers, and licensees are located around the world. The value of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies has seen significant volatility recently. While our business is primarily conducted in U.S. dollars, we source virtually all of our production overseas, and we generate significant revenues in Canada. Cost increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations could make our products less competitive or have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials or products more expensive and more difficult to finance. Additionally, fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of our reported sales and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA small number of vendors supply a significant amount of our products, and losing one or more of these vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn fiscal 2014, we purchased approximately 60% of our products from ten vendors, of which approximately half comes from three vendors. We expect that we will continue to source a significant portion of our products from these vendors. We do not have agreements with our major vendors that would provide us with assurances on a long-term basis as to adequate supply or pricing of our products. If any of our major vendors (i) decide to discontinue or significantly decrease the volume of products they manufacture for us, (ii) raise prices on products we purchase from them, or (iii) become unable to perform their responsibilities (e.g., if our vendors experience financial difficulties, lack of capacity or significant labor disputes) our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe currently source a significant portion of our products through a single port. Labor disruptions at that port or otherwise along our supply chain may adversely affect our relationships with customers, reputation with consumers, and results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. Labor disputes at independent factories where our goods are produced, the shipping ports we use, or our transportation carriers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes, or other disruptions during our peak manufacturing and importing times. The existing labor agreement between the Pacific Maritime Association (\u201cPMA\u201d), which represents operators of West Coast ports including the port through which we source a significant portion of our products, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, expired on July 1, 2014, and the parties recently reached a tentative labor agreement that must be ratified by union employees and the PMA. The negotiations led to work slowdowns and stoppages, which resulted in a significant backlog of cargo containers at West Coast ports. We have experienced delays in the shipment of our products as a result of this backlog, and we have not been able to meet our planned inventory allocations. In the event that these slow-downs continue or expand, disruptions or a strike occurs in connection with the labor agreement negotiations or otherwise, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe source substantially all of our products through a network of vendors. We have limited control over these vendors and\nwe may experience delays, product recalls, or loss of revenues if our products do not meet our quality standards.\nOur vendors may not continue to provide products that are consistent with our standards. We have occasionally received, and\nmay in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. A failure in our\nquality control program may result in diminished product quality, which in turn may result in increased order cancellations and returns, decreased consumer demand for our products, or product recalls, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Because we do not control our vendors, products that fail to meet our standards, or other unauthorized products, could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge. This could materially harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe may experience delays, product recalls, or loss of revenues if our products do not meet regulatory requirements.\nOur products are subject to regulation of and regulatory standards with respect to quality and safety set by various governmental authorities around the world, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada. These regulations and standards may change from time to time. Our inability, or that of our vendors, to comply on a timely basis with regulatory\nrequirements could result in significant fines or penalties, which could adversely affect our reputation and sales. Issues with the compliance of merchandise we sell with these regulations and standards, regardless of our culpability, or\ncustomer concerns about such issues, could result in damage to our reputation, lost sales, uninsured product liability claims or\nlosses, merchandise recalls, and increased costs.\nThe loss of a sourcing agent or our inability to effectively source inventory directly could negatively impact our ability to timely deliver our inventory supply and disrupt our business, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nCurrently, one sourcing agent manages approximately 70% of our inventory purchases. Although we believe that other buying\nagents could be retained, or that we could procure some of the inventory directly, the loss of this buying agent could delay our\nability to timely receive inventory supply and disrupt our business, which could result in a material adverse effect on our\noperating results. In addition, we source a significant amount of inventory directly and plan to continue to further increase such amounts. If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new vendors, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in producing our products and adhering to our quality control standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete\nmore effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of market share and, as a result, a decrease in revenue and gross profit.\nThe baby and young children's apparel market is highly competitive. Both branded and private label manufacturers compete in the baby and young children's apparel market. Our primary competitors in our wholesale businesses include private label product offerings and Disney and Gerber. Our primary competitors in the retail store channel include, in alphabetical order, Disney, Gap, Gymboree, Old Navy, and The Children's Place. Because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with many other manufacturers and retailers. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and larger customer bases than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to:\n\u2022 adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly;\n\u2022 take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily;\n\u2022 devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products; and\n\u2022 adopt more aggressive pricing strategies than we can.\nThe Company's retail success and future growth is dependent upon identifying locations and negotiating appropriate lease\nterms for retail stores.\nA significant portion of our revenues are through the Company's retail stores in leased retail locations across the United States and Canada. Successful operation of a retail store depends, in part, on the overall ability of the retail location to attract a consumer base sufficient to make store sales volume profitable. If we are unable to identify new retail locations with consumer traffic sufficient to support a profitable sales level, our retail growth may be limited. Further, if existing stores do not maintain a sufficient customer base that provides a reasonable sales volume or we are unable to negotiate appropriate lease terms for the retail stores, there could be a material adverse impact on our sales, gross margin, and results of operations.\nWe also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases on acceptable terms. In addition, from time to time, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to renew existing store leases, secure adequate new locations or successfully modify existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously\nnegotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur eCommerce business faces distinct risks, and our failure to successfully manage it could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nThe successful operation of our eCommerce business as well as our ability to provide a positive shopping experience that will generate orders and drive subsequent visits depends on efficient and uninterrupted operation of our order-taking and fulfillment operations. Risks associated with our eCommerce business include:\n\u2022 risks associated with the failure of the computer systems that operate our website including, among others, inadequate system capacity, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, security breaches, system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems;\n\u2022 disruptions in telephone service or power outages;\n\u2022 reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software, as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers;\n\u2022 rapid technology changes;\n\u2022 credit or debit card fraud;\n\u2022 the diversion of sales from our physical stores;\n\u2022 natural disasters or adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022 changes in applicable federal, state and international regulations;\n\u2022 liability for online content; and\n\u2022 consumer privacy concerns and regulation.\nProblems in any of these areas could result in a reduction in sales, increased costs and damage to our reputation and brands, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nProfitability and our reputation and relationships could be negatively impacted if we do not adequately forecast the demand\nfor our products and, as a result, create significant levels of excess inventory or insufficient levels of inventory.\nIf we do not adequately forecast demand for our products and purchases inventory to support an inaccurate forecast,\nwe could experience increased costs and lower selling prices due to the need to dispose of excess inventory. In\naddition, if we forecast demand for our products that is lower than actual demand, we may experience insufficient levels of\ninventory, which could result in damage to our relationships with customers and our reputation with consumers.\nWe may not achieve sales growth plans, cost savings, and other assumptions that support the carrying value of our\nintangible assets.\nThe carrying value of our goodwill, tradename assets, and brands are subject to annual impairment reviews as of the last day of each fiscal year or more frequently, if deemed necessary, due to any significant events or changes in circumstances. Estimated future cash flows used in these impairment reviews could be negatively impacted if we do not achieve our sales plans, planned cost savings, and other assumptions that support the carrying value of these intangible assets, which could result in impairment of the remaining asset values. Any material impairment would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have substantial debt, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to obtain financing\nin the future and to react to changes in our business.\nAs of January 3, 2015, we had approximately $586.0 million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding (excluding\napproximately $6.5 million of outstanding letters of credit), and approximately $182.5 million of undrawn availability under\nour senior secured revolving credit facility after giving effect to $6.5 million of letters of credit issued under our senior secured revolving credit facility.\nOur substantial debt could have significant consequences. Because of our substantial debt:\n\u2022 our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt may be adversely affected;\n\u2022 we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations,\nbecause a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022 we may be unable to make strategic acquisitions or be required to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, or general corporate or other purposes may be limited;\n\u2022 a significant portion of our cash flow from operations may have to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use that cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022 it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such debt;\n\u2022 we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and who, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns or to finance capital expenditures or acquisitions;\n\u2022 our costs of borrowing may increase;\n\u2022 we may be unable to renew or refinance our debt on terms as favorable as our existing debt or at all; and\n\u2022 our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be\nlimited, or we may be prevented from carrying out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth\nstrategy and efforts to improve the operating margins of our businesses.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to\nsatisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and\noperating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business,\nlegislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating\nactivities sufficient to permit us to fund our day-to-day operations or to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our\nindebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and other cash requirements, we\ncould be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital, or\nrestructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled\ndebt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems\nand might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our secured\nrevolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted\nsubsidiaries to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions and also restrict our and our restricted\nsubsidiaries\u2019 ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be\nable to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then\ndue.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all, could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability\nto satisfy our obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we could be in default and, as a result, lenders under the secured revolving\ncredit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing such borrowings the holders of our senior notes could accelerate the maturity of our obligations thereunder, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe terms of our secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictions and\nlimitations that could significantly impact our management\u2019s flexibility or our financial and operational flexibility to operate\nour business.\nOur secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, restricts our subsidiary, The William Carter Company (\"TWCC\"), and certain of its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022 incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 issue disqualified stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022 pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments;\n\u2022 redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022 prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022 make loans and investments (including joint ventures);\n\u2022 incur liens;\n\u2022 make dividends, loans or asset transfers from TWCC\u2019s subsidiaries;\n\u2022 sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022 consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of TWCC\u2019s assets to, another person;\n\u2022 designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022 enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022 enter into new lines of business.\nIn addition, our secured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial\ncondition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot\nassure that we will meet them.\nThe indenture governing the senior notes contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict TWCC and certain of its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022 incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments;\n\u2022 make loans and investments (including joint ventures);\n\u2022 incur liens;\n\u2022 sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022 create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to TWCC or TWCC's subsidiaries that are guarantors of the senior notes from certain subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the senior notes;\n\u2022 consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of TWCC\u2019s assets to, another person;\n\u2022 designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates.\nThe restrictions in the indenture that govern the senior notes as well as those under our secured revolving credit facility may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nA breach of the covenants under the indenture that governs the senior notes or under the secured revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such default may allow the holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the secured revolving credit facility could permit the lenders under the secured revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may need to seek waivers from the holders of our indebtedness to avoid being in\ndefault under the instruments governing such indebtedness. If we breach our covenants under our indebtedness, we may not be\nable to obtain a waiver from the holders of such indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all. If this occurs, we could be in\ndefault under such indebtedness, and the holders of such indebtedness and other lenders could exercise their rights as described\nabove, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nFurthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured revolving credit facility, those\nlenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or holders of\nsenior notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to repay such\nindebtedness.\nThe Company's success is dependent upon retaining key individuals within the organization to execute the Company's\nstrategic plan.\nThe Company's ability to attract and retain qualified executive management, marketing, merchandising, design, sourcing,\noperations, and support function staffing is key to the Company's success. If the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified individuals in these areas, this may result in an adverse impact on the Company's growth and results of operations. Our inability to retain personnel could cause us to experience business disruption due to a loss of historical knowledge and a lack of business continuity and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nOur failure to properly manage strategic projects in order to achieve our objectives may negatively impact our business.\nThe implementation of our business strategy periodically involves the execution of complex projects, which could place significant demands on our accounting, financial, information and other systems and on our business overall. Our ability to successfully implement such projects is dependent on management\u2019s ability to manage these projects effectively and implement them successfully. If we miscalculate the resources or time we need to complete a project or fail to implement the project effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nFailure to implement new information technology systems or needed upgrades to our systems, including operational and financial systems, could adversely affect our business.\nAs our business grows in size, complexity, and geography, we expect our information technology infrastructure to be in regular\nneed of enhancement and upgrades. Failure to implement new systems or upgrade systems, including operation and financial systems, as needed or complications encountered in implementing new systems or upgrading existing systems could cause\ndisruptions that may adversely affect our business results or operations. Further, additional investment needed to upgrade and expand our information technology infrastructure will require significant investment of additional resources and capital.\nOur Braselton, Georgia distribution facility handles a large portion of our merchandise distribution. If we encounter problems with this facility, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected.\nWe handle a large portion of our merchandise distribution for all of our stores, including our online retail operations, from\na single facility in Braselton, Georgia. Our ability to meet consumer expectations manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on proper operation of this facility. If we are not able to distribute merchandise to our stores or customers because we have exceeded our capacity at the distribution facility (such as due to a high level of demand during peak periods) or because of natural disasters, accidents, system failures, disruptions or other events, our sales could decline, which may have a materially adverse effect on our earnings, financial position and our reputation. In addition, we use an automated system that manages the order processing for our eCommerce business. In the event that this system becomes inoperable for any reason, we may be unable to ship direct-to-consumer orders in a timely manner, and as a result, we could experience a reduction in our direct-to-consumer business, which could negatively impact our sales and profitability.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding into international markets.\nWe cannot be sure that we can successfully complete any planned international expansion or that new international business will be profitable or meet our expectations. We do not have significant experience operating in markets outside of the United States and Canada. Consumer demand, behavior, tastes, and purchasing trends may differ in international markets and, as a result, sales of our products may not be successful or meet our expectations, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. We may encounter differences in business culture and the legal environment that may make working with commercial partners and hiring and retaining an adequate employee base more challenging. We may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations with our current operations. Any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets. Our entry into new markets may have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and such costs may be greater than expected. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, our results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur results of operations, financial position, and cash flows, and our ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.\nOur ability to conduct business in new and existing international markets is subject to legal, regulatory, political, and economic\nrisks. These include:\n\u2022 the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations, including trade and labor restrictions;\n\u2022 compliance with U.S. and other countries' laws relating to foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022 new tariffs or other barriers in some international markets.\nWe are also subject to general political and economic risks in connection with our international operations, including:\n\u2022 political instability and terrorist attacks;\n\u2022 differences in business culture;\n\u2022 different laws governing relationships with employees and business partners;\n\u2022 changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u2022 general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.\nWe cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the United States or foreign countries upon the import or export of our products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have, if any, on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social or economic policies, and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to income taxes in federal and applicable state and local tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, and other foreign jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of current and future payments, which include reserves for estimates of uncertain tax positions. At any time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may impact the ultimate settlement of these tax positions. As a result, there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in any financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings.\nThe Company's future success and growth through expansion of its international operations could be adversely affected by\nviolations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar world-wide anti-bribery laws.\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar world-wide anti-bribery laws, prohibit companies and their\nintermediaries from making improper payments to non-United States officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining\nbusiness. The Company's policies mandate compliance with anti-bribery laws. Our internal control policies and procedures, or those of our vendors, may not adequately protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by the Company's employees, agents, or vendors. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to various claims and pending or threatened lawsuits, and, as a result, may incur substantial costs\nthat adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims and pending or threatened lawsuits in the course of its business. In the event we are\nrequired or determine to pay amounts in connection with any such lawsuits, such amounts could be significant and could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price for our common stock\nto decline.\nIn 2013, we initiated a quarterly cash dividend. Future declarations of quarterly cash dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are at the discretion of our Board of Directors based on a number of factors, including our future financial performance and other investment priorities. Additionally, provisions in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes could have the effect of restricting our ability to pay future cash dividends on, or make future repurchases of, our common stock. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 89876, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "CRI"}
