{"cik": "1230245", "company": "PIPER JAFFRAY COMPANIES", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nDevelopments in market and economic conditions have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business and profitability and cause volatility in our results of operations.\nEconomic and market conditions have had, and will continue to have, a direct and material impact on our results of operations and financial condition because performance in the financial services industry is heavily influenced by the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity. For example:\n\u2022\nOur equities investment banking revenue, in the form of underwriting, placement and financial advisory fees, is directly related to macroeconomic conditions and corresponding financial market activity. When the outlook for macroeconomic conditions is uncertain or negative, financial market activity generally tends to be decreased, which can reduce our equities investment banking revenues. As an example, a significant component of our investment banking revenues are derived from initial public offerings of middle-market companies in growth sectors, and activity in this area is highly correlated to the macroeconomic environment and market conditions. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, volatility in equity markets began increasing leading up to the Federal Reserve's decision to raise the federal funds rate in December. This volatility has continued into the first quarter of 2016 as the markets weigh falling commodity prices, depressed energy markets, a slowdown in global economic growth, including in China and other developing markets, and weakening growth in the U.S. In addition, U.S. financial markets remain vulnerable to the potential risks posed by exogenous shocks, which could include, among other things, further conflict in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe, political and financial uncertainty in the European Union and further government debt crises, and a more severe and prolonged downturn in China's economy. If these factors were to worsen or if an exogenous shock were to materialize, it could lead to further or more severe equity market declines and volatility, which would likely have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\n\u2022\nInterest rates have a significant impact on our business, particularly our fixed income institutional business. This includes the direction and rate of change in rates, as well as uncertainy around both of these. Volatility generally increased in 2015, reflecting the uncertainty and volatility around the Federal Reserve's decision to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade, slowing economic growth in China, and the potential for a global economic slowdown. Yields are expected to be impacted in 2016 by perceptions around the strength of the U.S. economy and the ability of the Federal Reserve to gradually raise the federal funds rate through the year. As to the impact to our business, a large percentage of our securities inventory - both that held for facilitating client activity as well as our own proprietary trading - consist of fixed income securities, and a rapid increase in interest rates would decrease the value of these positions, possibly significantly. Further, our interest rate hedging strategies may not mitigate this volatility as we generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk and volatility may reduce the correlation (i.e., effectiveness) between certain hedging vehicles and the securities inventory we are attempting to hedge. In addition, interest rate increases in 2016, both gradual and more severe, may negatively impact the volume of debt\nrefinancing issuances underwritten by our public finance investment banking business, as well as our managed funds focused on master limited partnerships (\"MLPs\"), which may underperform in a rising interest rate environment.\n\u2022\nAn unsustainable U.S. economic recovery, or a significant worsening of global economic conditions, would likely result in a decline in the financial markets, reducing asset valuations and adversely impacting our asset management business. A reduction in asset values would negatively impact this business by reducing the value of assets under management, and as a result, the revenues generated from this business.\nIt is difficult to predict the market conditions for 2016, which are dependent in large part upon the pace of global and U.S. economic growth. Our smaller scale compared to many of our competitors and the cyclical nature of the economy and this industry leads to volatility in our financial results, including our operating margins, compensation ratios and revenue and expense levels. Our financial performance may be limited by the fixed nature of certain expenses, the impact from unanticipated losses or expenses during the year, and the inability to scale back costs in a timeframe to match decreases in revenue-related changes in market and economic conditions. As a result, our financial results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nDevelopments in specific business sectors of the U.S. and global economy, as well as areas of the markets in which we conduct our business, have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business and profitability.\nOur results for a particular period may be disproportionately impacted by declines in specific sectors of the U.S. or global economy, or for certain products within the financial services industry, due to our business mix and focus areas. For example:\n\u2022\nOur equities investment banking business focuses on specific sectors, specifically healthcare, consumer, diversified industrials and services, business services, technology, financial institutions, and agriculture, clean technologies and renewables. Volatility, uncertainty, or slowdowns in these sectors, particularly healthcare, may adversely affect our business, sometimes disproportionately, and may cause volatility in the net revenues we receive from our capital markets and corporate advisory activities. In recent years, the healthcare sector has been a significant contributor to our overall results, and negative developments in this sector would materially and disproportionately impact us, even if general economic conditions were strong. Further, energy markets are currently suffering from a prolonged depression in oil and natural gas prices, and uncertainty regarding the outlook for future oil prices is dampening the prospects of many energy companies and reducing capital markets and corporate advisory activities in the sector. We recently announced the acquisition of Simmons & Company International, an energy-based investment banking firm, and the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. Upon close, the energy sector will become one of our most significant sectors of coverage for our equity investment banking business. Disproportionately negative market conditions in the energy sector will slow and hinder our ability to realize the benefits from the acquisition. Lastly, we may not participate or may participate to a lesser degree than other firms in sectors that experience significant activity, such as real estate, and our operating results may not correlate with the results of other firms which participate in these sectors.\n\u2022\nOur fixed income institutional business derives its revenue from sales and trading activity in the municipal market and from products within the taxable market, including structured mortgages, hybrid preferreds and government agency products. Our operating results for our fixed income institutional business may not correlate with the results of other firms or the fixed income market generally because we do not participate in significant segments of the fixed income markets such as credit default swaps, corporate high-yield bonds, currencies and commodities.\n\u2022\nOur public finance investment banking business depends heavily upon conditions in the municipal market. Our public finance business focuses on investment banking activity in sectors that include state and local government, education, senior living, healthcare, transportation, and hospitality sectors, with an emphasis on transactions with a par value of $500 million or less. Challenging market conditions for these sectors that are disproportionately worse than those impacting the broader economy or municipal markets generally may adversely impact our business. More broadly, our fixed income institutional business and our public finance business are tied to the municipal market and the enactment, or the threat of enactment, of any legislation that would alter the financing alternatives available to municipalities through the elimination or reduction of tax-exempt bonds.\n\u2022\nA significant portion of our asset management revenues are derived from actively managed equity products, and this type of investment product has experienced asset outflows in recent years, including in 2015. In addition, U.S. equity markets were largely flat or slightly down in 2015, and the beginning of 2016 saw further declines and increased volatility. Uncertainty relating to global and U.S. economic growth and equity valuations, the continued shift into lower-cost passively-managed funds, and other negative events impacting investor confidence could cause the negative trend for actively-managed equity products to continue. Outflows for this investment product negatively affect results of operations for this business, as revenues are closely tied to assets under management.\n\u2022\nManagement and performance fees we earn on assets invested by institutions and individuals in our managed funds focused on MLPs and other investments related to the energy infrastructure sector are a meaningful contributor to our asset management revenues. Return on investment in the energy infrastructure sector is dependent to a meaningful degree on the prices of energy commodities such as natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, refined petroleum products or coal. Persistently depressed prices for any of these products, such as those experienced in 2015, will likely lead to a further deterioration of market conditions for companies in the energy infrastructure sector and poorer returns by our funds, and, consequently, a reduction in the management and performance fees we receive.\nOur stock price may fluctuate as a result of several factors, including but not limited to, changes in our revenues, operating results, tangible book value and return on equity.\nWe have experienced, and expect to experience in the future, fluctuations in the market price of our common stock due to factors that relate to the nature of our business, including but not limited to changes in our revenues, operating results, tangible book value, and return on equity. Our business, by its nature, does not produce steady and predictable earnings on a quarterly basis, which causes fluctuations in our stock price that may be significant. Other factors that have affected, and may further affect, our stock price include changes in or news related to economic or market events or conditions, changes in market conditions in the financial services industry, including developments in regulation affecting our business, failure to meet the expectations of market analysts, changes in recommendations or outlooks by market analysts, and aggressive short selling similar to that experienced in the financial industry in 2008.\nWe may make strategic acquisitions and minority investments, engage in joint ventures or divest or exit existing businesses, which could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and have disruptive effects on our business and may not yield the benefits we expect.\nWe may grow in part through corporate development activities that may include acquisitions, joint ventures and minority investment stakes. For example, we expanded our existing asset management business in March 2010 with the acquisition of ARI, a Chicago-based asset management firm, and we added to our public finance and fixed income sales and trading and corporate advisory businesses with our acquisitions of Seattle-Northwest Securities Corporation and Edgeview Partners, L.P. in July 2013. In 2015, we expanded our equities investment banking business into the financial institutions and energy sectors, respectively, through our completed acquisition of River Branch Holdings LLC and our announced acquisition of Simmons & Company International, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. We also added scale to our fixed income institutional sales and trading business through our acquisition of BMO Capital Markets GKST Inc. There are a number of risks associated with corporate development activities. Costs or difficulties relating to a transaction, including integration of products, employees, technology systems, accounting systems and management controls, may be difficult to predict accurately and be greater than expected causing our estimates to differ from actual results. Importantly, we may be unable to retain key personnel after the transaction, and the transaction may impair relationships with customers and business partners. We may incur unforeseen liabilities of an acquired company that could impose significant and unanticipated legal costs on us. Also, our share price could decline after we announce or complete a transaction if investors view the transaction as too costly or unlikely to improve our competitive position. Longer-term, these activities may require increased costs in the form of management personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which, in the absence of continued revenue growth, would cause our operating margins to decline. More generally, any difficulties that we experience could disrupt our ongoing business, increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We also may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits and synergies from the transaction as fully as expected or within the expected time frame. Divestitures or elimination of existing businesses or products could have similar effects. For example, we shut down our Hong Kong capital markets business in 2012, and realized a pre-tax loss on the investment in our Hong Kong subsidiaries.\nOur proprietary trading and principal investments expose us to risk of loss.\nWe engage in a variety of activities in which we commit or invest our own capital, including proprietary trading and principal investing. Our proprietary trading activities (which we also refer to as \"strategic trading\" in this report) related to municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities have been a meaningful contributor to our overall financial results. Fixed income proprietary trading activities comprise a meaningful percentage of our Level III assets within our securities inventory. Level III assets have little or no pricing observability, and may be less liquid than other securities that we hold in our securities inventory. In addition to proprietary trading, we engage in principal investing, having established alternative asset management funds for merchant banking (focused on investments in the equity and debt instruments of private companies) and senior living construction projects. We have invested firm capital in these funds alongside capital raised from outside investors, and intend to continue to develop\nthese alternative asset management strategies. Additionally, we make principal investments in funds managed by ARI, our asset management subsidiary, which are generally invested in publicly traded equities.\nOur results from these activities may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. We may incur significant losses from our proprietary trading activities and principal investments due to fixed income or equity market fluctuations and volatility from quarter to quarter. For example, in 2015, our principal investments in ARI funds focused on MLPs and other investments related to the energy sector, and, as a result, suffered significant declines related to the ongoing downturn in that sector. In addition, we may engage in hedging transactions that if not successful, could result in losses. With respect to principal investing, there often is not an established liquid trading market for these investments or our investments may be otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, and our ability to withdraw our capital from these investments may be limited, increasing our risk of losses. Also, our merchant banking activity involves investments in late stage private companies, and we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business.\nMaintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients, customers, investors, and employees. If we fail to deal with, or appear to fail to deal with, issues that may give rise to reputational risk, such failure or appearance of failure could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. These issues include, but are not limited to, any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A, appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues, money laundering, cybersecurity, and the proper identification of the strategic, market, credit, liquidity, human capital, and operational risks inherent in our business and products.\nFinancing and advisory services engagements are transactional in nature and do not generally provide for subsequent engagements.\nEven though we work to represent our clients at every stage of their lifecycle, we are typically retained on a short-term, engagement-by-engagement basis in connection with specific capital markets or mergers and acquisitions transactions. As a consequence, the timing of when fees are earned, and, therefore, our financial results from capital markets and corporate advisory activities may experience volatility quarter to quarter based on equity market conditions as well as the macroeconomic business cycle more broadly. In particular, our revenues related to acquisition and disposition transactions tend to be highly volatile and unpredictable (or \u201clumpy\u201d) from quarter to quarter due to the one-time nature of the transaction and the size of the fee. As a result, high levels of revenue in one quarter will not necessarily be predictive of continued high levels of revenue in any subsequent period. If we are unable to generate a substantial number of new engagements and generate fees from the successful completion of those transactions, our business and results of operations will likely be adversely affected.\nThe volume of anticipated investment banking transactions may differ from actual results.\nThe completion of anticipated investment banking transactions in our pipeline is uncertain and partially beyond our control, and our investment banking revenue is typically earned only upon the successful completion of a transaction. In most cases, we receive little or no payment for investment banking engagements that do not result in the successful completion of a transaction. For example, a client's acquisition transaction may be delayed or terminated because of a failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty, failure to obtain necessary regulatory consents or board or stockholder approvals, failure to secure necessary financing, adverse market conditions or unexpected financial or other problems in the client's or counterparty's business. If parties fail to complete a transaction on which we are advising or an offering in which we are participating, we earn little or no revenue from the transaction and may have incurred significant expenses (for example, travel and legal expenses) associated with the transaction. Accordingly, our business is highly dependent on market conditions as well as the decisions and actions of our clients and interested third parties, and the number of engagements we have at any given time (and any characterization or description of our deal pipelines) is subject to change and may not necessarily result in future revenues.\nAsset management revenue may vary based on investment performance and market and economic factors.\nWe have grown our asset management business in recent years, including with the acquisition of ARI in 2010, which has increased the risks associated with this business relative to our overall operations. Assets under management are a significant driver of this business, as revenues are primarily derived from management fees paid on the assets under management. Our ability to maintain or increase assets under management is subject to a number of factors, including investors' perception of our past performance, market or economic conditions, competition from other fund managers and our ability to negotiate terms with major investors.\nInvestment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing clients and competing for new asset management business. Poor investment performance and other competitive factors could reduce our revenues and impair our growth in many ways: existing clients may withdraw funds from our asset management business in favor of better performing products or a different investment style or focus; our capital investments in our investment funds or the seed capital we have committed to new asset management products may diminish in value or may be lost; and our key employees in the business may depart, whether to join a competitor or otherwise.\nTo the extent our investment performance is perceived to be poor in either relative or absolute terms, our asset management revenues will likely be reduced and our ability to attract new funds will likely be impaired. Even when market conditions are generally favorable, our investment performance may be adversely affected by our investment style and the particular investments that we make. Further, as the size and number of investment funds, including exchange-traded funds, hedge funds and private equity funds increases, it is possible that it will become increasingly difficult for us to attract new assets under management or price competition may mean that we are unable to maintain our current fee structures.\nOur ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled and productive employees is critical to the success of our business.\nHistorically, the market for qualified employees within the financial services industry has been marked by intense competition, and the performance of our business may suffer to the extent we are unable to attract and retain employees effectively, particularly given the relatively small size of our company and our employee base compared to some of our competitors and the geographic locations in which we operate. The primary sources of revenue in each of our business lines are commissions and fees earned on advisory and underwriting transactions and customer accounts managed by our employees, who have historically been recruited by other firms and in certain cases are able to take their client relationships with them when they change firms. Some specialized areas of our business are operated by a relatively small number of employees, the loss of any of whom could jeopardize the continuation of that business following the employee's departure.\nFurther, recruiting and retention success often depends on the ability to deliver competitive compensation, and we may be at a disadvantage to some competitors given our size and financial resources. Our inability or unwillingness to meet compensation needs or demands may result in the loss of some of our professionals or the inability to recruit additional professionals at compensation levels that are within our target range for compensation and benefits expense. Our ability to retain and recruit also may be hindered if we limit our aggregate annual compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of annual net revenues.\nAn inability to readily divest trading positions may result in financial losses to our business.\nTimely divestiture of our trading positions, including equity, fixed income and other securities positions, can be impaired by decreased trading volume, increased price volatility, rapid changes in interest rates, concentrated trading positions, limitations on the ability to divest positions in highly specialized or structured transactions and changes in industry and government regulations. This is true both for customer transactions that we facilitate as well as proprietary trading positions that we maintain. While we hold a security, we are vulnerable to valuation fluctuations and may experience financial losses to the extent the value of the security decreases and we are unable to timely divest or hedge our trading position in that security. The value may decline as a result of many factors, including issuer-specific, market or geopolitical events. In addition, in times of market uncertainty, the inability to transfer inventory positions may have an impact on our liquidity as funding sources generally decline and we are unable to pledge the underlying security as collateral. Our liquidity may also be impacted if we choose to facilitate liquidity for specific products and voluntarily increase our inventory positions in order to do so, exposing ourselves to greater market risk and potential financial losses from the reduction in value of illiquid positions.\nIn addition, reliance on revenues from hedge funds and hedge fund advisors, which are less regulated than many investment company and advisor clients, may expose us to greater risk of financial loss from unsettled trades than is the case with other types of institutional investors. Concentration of risk may result in losses to us even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in our industry.\nOur businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets.\nThe nature of our businesses exposes us to the risk that third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Deterioration in the credit quality of securities or obligations we hold could result in losses and adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results. Default rates, downgrades and disputes with\ncounterparties as to the valuation of collateral tend to increase in times of market stress and illiquidity. Although we review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Also, concerns about, or a default by, one institution generally leads to losses, significant liquidity problems, or defaults by other institutions, which in turn adversely affects our business.\nParticular activities or products within our business expose us to increased credit risk, including inventory positions, interest rate swap contracts with customer credit exposure, counterparty risk with two major financial institutions related to customer interest rate swap contracts without customer credit exposure, investment banking and advisory fee receivables, customer margin accounts, and trading counterparty activities related to settlement and similar activities. With respect to interest rate swap contracts with customer credit exposure, we have retained the credit exposure with five public finance counterparties totaling $24.4 million at December 31, 2015 as part of our matched-book interest rate swap program. In the event of a termination of the contract, the counterparty would owe us the applicable amount of the credit exposure. If our counterparty is unable to make its payment to us, we would still be obligated to pay our hedging counterparty, resulting in credit losses. Non-performance by our counterparties, clients and others, including with respect to our inventory positions, interest rate swap contracts with customer credit exposures and our merchant banking debt investments could result in losses, potentially material, and thus have a significant adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAn inability to access capital readily or on terms favorable to us could impair our ability to fund operations and could jeopardize our financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to our business. Several large financial institutions failed or merged with others during the credit crisis following significant declines in asset values in securities held by these institutions, and, during 2011, a financial institution failed due to liquidity issues related to the European sovereign debt crisis. To fund our business, we rely on commercial paper and bank financing as well as other funding sources such as the repurchase markets. Our bank financing includes uncommitted credit lines, which could become unavailable to us on relatively short notice. In an effort to mitigate this funding risk, we renewed a $250 million committed credit facility for the seventh consecutive year in 2015. We also have $175 million of unsecured notes. The notes consist of two classes, with $125 million maturing in October 2018 and $50 million maturing in May 2017. In order to further diversify our short-term funding needs, we also continue to maintain three commercial paper programs in the amounts of $300 million, $150 million, and $125 million.\nOur access to funding sources, particularly uncommitted funding sources, could be hindered by many factors, and many of these factors we cannot control, such as economic downturns, the disruption of financial markets, the failure or consolidation of other financial institutions, negative news about the financial industry generally or us specifically. We could experience disruptions with our credit facilities in the future, including the loss of liquidity sources and/or increased borrowing costs, if lenders or investors develop a negative perception of our short- or long-term financial prospects, which could result from decreased business activity. Our liquidity also could be impacted by the activities resulting in concentration of risk, including proprietary activities from long-term investments and/or investments in specific markets or products without liquidity. Our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities take significant action against us, or if we discover that one of our employees has engaged in serious unauthorized or illegal activity.\nIn the future, we may need to incur debt or issue equity in order to fund our working capital requirements, as well as to execute our growth initiatives that may include acquisitions and other investments. Similarly, our access to funding sources may be contingent upon terms and conditions that may limit or restrict our business activities and growth initiatives. For example, the unsecured notes discussed above include covenants that, among other things, limit our leverage ratio and require maintenance of certain levels of tangible net worth, regulatory net capital, and operating cash flow to fixed charges.\nLastly, we currently do not have a credit rating, which could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position by increasing our borrowing costs and limiting access to sources of liquidity that require a credit rating as a condition to providing funds.\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses.\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our sales and trading, proprietary trading, merchant banking and underwriting businesses. We have committed capital to these businesses, and we may take substantial positions in particular types of securities and/or issuers. This concentration of risk may cause us to suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors. Further, disruptions in the credit markets can make it difficult to hedge exposures effectively and economically.\nOur information and technology systems, including outsourced systems, are critical components of our operations, and failure of those systems or other aspects of our operations infrastructure may disrupt our business, cause financial loss and constrain our growth.\nWe typically transact thousands of securities trades on a daily basis across multiple markets. Our data and transaction processing, custody, financial, accounting and other technology and operating systems are essential to this task. A system malfunction (due to hardware failure, capacity overload, security incident, data corruption, etc.) or mistake made relating to the processing of transactions could result in financial loss, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, reputational damage and constraints on our ability to grow. We outsource a substantial portion of our critical data processing activities, including trade processing and back office data processing. For example, we have entered into contracts with Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (\"Broadridge\"), pursuant to which Broadridge handles our trade and back office processing, and Unisys Corporation (\"Unisys\"), pursuant to which Unisys supports our data center and helpdesk needs. We also contract with third parties for market data services, which constantly broadcast news, quotes, analytics and other relevant information to our employees. We contract with other vendors to produce and mail our customer statements and to provide other services. In the event that any of these service providers fails to adequately perform such services or the relationship between that service provider and us is terminated, we may experience a significant disruption in our operations, including our ability to timely and accurately process transactions or maintain complete and accurate records of those transactions.\nAdapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements, client needs, geographic expansion and industry demands also is critical for our business. Introduction of new technologies present new challenges on a regular basis. We have an ongoing need to upgrade and improve our various technology systems, including our data and transaction processing, financial, accounting, risk management, compliance, and trading systems. This need could present operational issues or require significant capital spending. It also may require us to make additional investments in technology systems and may require us to reevaluate the current value and/or expected useful lives of our technology systems, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur clients routinely provide us with sensitive and confidential information. Secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our internal and outsourced computer systems and networks is critically important to our business. We take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant. However, our computer systems, software and networks, and those of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, cyberattacks, security breaches, computer viruses or other malicious code, inadvertent, erroneous or intercepted transmission of information (including by e-mail), and other events that could have an information security impact. We work with our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against these events, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of these third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients' or counterparties' confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or those of third parties, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients', our counterparties' or third parties' operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to reputational harm as well as litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\nA disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business due to fire, natural disaster, health emergency (for example, a disease pandemic), power or communication failure, act of terrorism or war may affect our ability to service and interact with our clients. If we are not able to implement contingency plans effectively, any such disruption could harm our results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals could significantly curtail the revenue from certain products that we currently provide.\nProposed changes in laws or regulations relating to our business could decrease, perhaps significantly, the revenue that we receive from certain products or services that we provide. For example, federal law currently allows investors in debt issuances by government and non-profit entities to exclude the bond interest for federal income tax purposes, resulting in lower interest expense for the issuer as compared to a taxable financing. In recent years, federal lawmakers have presented various proposals to limit or eliminate the tax-exempt status of this bond interest. Our public finance investment banking business receives significant revenues as a result of underwriting activity in connection with debt issuances by government and non-profit clients, primarily on a tax-exempt basis. Also, a significant percentage of our securities inventory - both positions held for client activity and our own proprietary trading positions - consist of municipal securities. Any reduction or elimination of tax-exempt bond interest could\nnegatively impact the value of the municipal securities we hold in our securities inventory as well as our public finance investment banking business more generally, which would negatively impact the results of operations for these businesses.\nOur exposure to legal liability is significant, and could lead to substantial damages.\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses. These risks include potential liability under securities laws and regulations in connection with our capital markets, asset management and other businesses. The volume and amount of damages claimed in litigation, arbitrations, regulatory enforcement actions and other adversarial proceedings against financial services firms have increased in recent years. Our experience has been that adversarial proceedings against financial services firms typically increase during and following a market downturn. We also are subject to claims from disputes with our employees and our former employees under various circumstances. Risks associated with legal liability often are difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time, making the amount of legal reserves related to these legal liabilities difficult to determine and subject to future revision. Legal or regulatory matters involving our directors, officers or employees in their individual capacities also may create exposure for us because we may be obligated or may choose to indemnify the affected individuals against liabilities and expenses they incur in connection with such matters to the extent permitted under applicable law. In addition, like other financial services companies, we may face the possibility of employee fraud or misconduct. The precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases and there can be no assurance that we will be able to deter or prevent fraud or misconduct. Exposures from and expenses incurred related to any of the foregoing actions or proceedings could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future results of operations could be adversely affected if reserves relating to these legal liabilities are required to be increased or legal proceedings are resolved in excess of established reserves.\nOur inability to identify and address actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest may negatively impact our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe regularly address actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest in our business, including situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client. Appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and we face the risk that our current policies, controls and procedures do not timely identify or appropriately manage such conflicts of interest. It is possible that actual, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to client dissatisfaction, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with potential or actual conflicts of interest. Client dissatisfaction, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions arising from a failure to adequately deal with conflicts of interest, and the reputational harm suffered as a consequence, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and a significant regulatory action against our company may have a material adverse financial effect or cause significant reputational harm to our company.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, we are subject to complex and extensive regulation of many aspects of our business by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies, self-regulatory organizations (including securities exchanges) and by foreign governmental agencies, regulatory bodies and securities exchanges. Specifically, our operating subsidiaries include broker dealer and related securities entities organized in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong, China. Each of these entities is registered or licensed with the applicable local securities regulator and is subject to all of the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by those authorities. In addition, our asset management subsidiaries, ARI, PJIM, and PJC Capital Partners LLC are registered as investment advisers with the SEC and subject to the regulation and oversight by the SEC.\nGenerally, the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us. These requirements are not designed to protect our shareholders. Consequently, broker dealer regulations often serve to limit our activities, through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements and restrictions on the businesses in which we may operate or invest. We also must comply with asset management regulations, including requirements related to fiduciary duties to clients, recordkeeping and reporting and customer disclosures. Compliance with many of these regulations entails a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be newer or unclear. In addition, regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business may intervene in our business and we and our employees could be fined or otherwise disciplined for violations or prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities.\nOur business also subjects us to the complex income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we have business operations, and these tax laws may be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes. We are subject to contingent tax risk that could adversely affect our results of operations, to the extent that our interpretations of tax laws are disputed upon examination or audit, and are settled in amounts in excess of established reserves for such contingencies.\nThe effort to combat money laundering also has become a high priority in governmental policy with respect to financial institutions. The obligation of financial institutions, including ourselves, to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls which have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs. Any failure with respect to our programs in this area could subject us to serious regulatory consequences, including substantial fines, and potentially other liabilities. In addition, our international operations require compliance with anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot ensure that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees or agents, which acts could subject our company to fines or other regulatory consequences.\nRisk management processes may not fully mitigate exposure to the various risks that we face, including market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.\nWe refine our risk management techniques, strategies and assessment methods on an ongoing basis. However, risk management techniques and strategies, both ours and those available to the market generally, may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk. For example, we may fail to identify or anticipate particular risks that our systems are capable of identifying, or the systems that we use, and that are used within the industry generally, may not be capable of identifying certain risk, or every economic and financial outcome, or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. In addition, our risk management techniques and strategies seek to balance our ability to profit from our market-making and investing positions with our exposure to potential losses. Some of our strategies for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior. We apply statistical and other tools to these observations to quantify our risk exposure. Any failures in our risk management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify our risk exposure could limit our ability to manage risks. In addition, any risk management failures could cause our losses to be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. Further, our quantified modeling does not take all risks into account. Our more qualitative approach to managing those risks could prove insufficient, exposing us to material unanticipated losses.\nUse of derivative instruments as part of our financial risk management techniques may not effectively hedge the risks associated with activities in certain of our businesses.\nWe use interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, credit default swap index contracts and option contracts as a means to manage risk in certain inventory positions and to facilitate customer transactions. With respect to risk management, we enter into derivative contracts to hedge interest rate and market value risks associated with our security positions, including fixed income inventory positions we hold both for facilitating client activity as well as for our own proprietary trading operations. The instruments use interest rates based upon the Municipal Market Data (\u201cMMD\u201d), LIBOR or SIFMA index. We also enter into credit default swap index contracts to hedge risks associated with our taxable fixed income securities, and option contracts to hedge market value risk associated with convertible securities and mortgage-backed securities. Generally, we do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. In addition, these hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate and market value risk, especially when market volatility reduces the correlation between a hedging vehicle and the securities inventory being hedged.\nThere are risks inherent in our use of these products, including counterparty exposure and basis risk. Counterparty exposure refers to the risk that the amount of collateral in our possession on any given day may not be sufficient to fully cover the current value of the swaps if a counterparty were to suddenly default. Basis risk refers to risks associated with swaps where changes in the value of the swaps may not exactly mirror changes in the value of the cash flows they are hedging. We may incur losses from our exposure to derivative interest rate products and the increased use of these products in the future.\nThe use of estimates and valuations in measuring fair value involve significant estimation and judgment by management.\nWe make various estimates that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Broadly, those estimates are used in measuring fair value of certain financial instruments, investments in private companies, accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, establishing provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation, and regulatory proceedings and tax examinations. Estimates are based on available information and judgment. Therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates and that difference could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nFinancial instruments and other inventory positions owned, and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased, are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation techniques involve management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments' complexity. Difficult market environments, such as those experienced in 2008, may cause financial instruments to become substantially more illiquid and difficult to value, increasing the use of valuation models. Our future results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the valuation adjustments that we apply to these financial instruments.\nInvestments in private companies are valued based on an assessment of each underlying security, considering rounds of financing, third party transactions and market-based information, including comparable company transactions, trading multiples (e.g., multiples of revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\")) and changes in market outlook, among other factors. These valuation techniques require significant management estimation and judgment.\nThe financial services industry and the markets in which we operate are subject to systemic risk that could adversely affect our business and results.\nParticipants in the financial services industry and markets increasingly are closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing, technology and other relationships between them. A significant adverse development with one participant (such as a bankruptcy or default) may spread to others and lead to significant concentrated or market-wide problems (such as defaults, liquidity problems or losses) for other participants, including us. This systemic risk was evident during 2008 following the demise of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, and the resulting events (sometimes described as \u201ccontagion\u201d) had a negative impact on the remaining industry participants, including us. Further, the control and risk management infrastructure of the markets in which we operate often is outpaced by financial innovation and growth in new types of securities, transactions and markets. Systemic risk is inherently difficult to assess and quantify, and its form and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time.\nRegulatory capital requirements may limit our ability to expand or maintain our present levels of business or impair our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nWe are subject to the SEC's uniform net capital rule (Rule 15c3-1) and the net capital rule of FINRA, which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from Piper Jaffray & Co., our U.S. broker dealer subsidiary. The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid. FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements. Underwriting commitments require a charge against net capital and, accordingly, our ability to make underwriting commitments may be limited by the requirement that we must at all times be in compliance with the applicable net capital regulations.\nAs Piper Jaffray Companies is a holding company, it depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund its obligations. The regulatory restrictions described above may impede access to funds our holding company needs to make payments on any such obligations.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully with other companies in the financial services industry who often have significantly greater resources than we do.\nThe financial services industry remains extremely competitive, and our revenues and profitability will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively. We compete generally on the basis of such factors as quality of advice and service, reputation, price, product selection, transaction execution and financial resources. Pricing and other competitive pressures in investment banking, including trends toward multiple book runners, co-managers, and multiple financial advisors handling transactions, have continued and could\nadversely affect our revenues. The trend toward multiple book runners has also been accompanied by an increasing disparity in the relative economics between or among book runners, with the senior book runner(s) receiving a large percentage of the economics.\nWe remain at a competitive disadvantage given our relatively small size compared to some of our competitors. Large financial services firms have a larger capital base, greater access to capital and greater resources than we have, affording them greater capacity for risk and potential for innovation, an extended geographic reach and flexibility to offer a broader set of products. For example, these firms have used their resources and larger capital base to take advantage of growth in international markets and to support their investment banking business by offering credit products to corporate clients, which is a significant competitive advantage. With respect to our fixed income institutional and public finance investment banking businesses, it is more difficult for us to diversify and differentiate our product set, and our fixed income business mix currently is concentrated in the municipal market and to a lesser extent corporate credits and structured mortgage products, potentially with less opportunity for growth than other firms which have grown their fixed income businesses by investing in, developing and offering non-traditional products (e.g., credit default swaps, interest rate products and currencies and commodities).\nThe business operations that we conduct outside of the United States subject us to unique risks.\nTo the extent we conduct business outside the United States, for example in Asia and Europe, we are subject to risks including, without limitation, the risk that we will be unable to provide effective operational support to these business activities, the risk of non-compliance with foreign laws and regulations, and the general economic and political conditions in countries where we conduct business, which may differ significantly from those in the United States. With respect to our Asia-based capital markets activity, we facilitated underwritten capital-raising transactions for Asia-based issuers, which may have exposed us to greater underwriting risk in our capital markets business as compared to the U.S., as noted above.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the market value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter abusive takeover tactics by making them unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include limitations on our shareholders' ability to act by written consent and to call special meetings. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal, and are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 89968, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "PIPR"}
