{"cik": "1397047", "company": "FlexShopper, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information presented in this Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our business. Any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties, could harm our business and financial results and cause the value of our securities to decline, which in turn could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks and other information contained in this Form 10-K before you decide whether to buy our common stock. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock. In addition, the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business.\nBusiness Risks\nLimited operating history. FlexShopper, LLC, which was formed in June 2013 to enter the LTO business, has a limited operating history upon which investors may judge our performance. Our new FlexShopper business has generated revenues over a limited operating history and has incurred net losses. Our ability to achieve profitability in this business will depend upon many factors, including, without limitation, our ability to execute our growth strategy and technology development, obtain sufficient capital, develop relationships with third party retail partners, adapt to fluctuations in the economy and modify our strategy based on the degree and nature of competition. Our senior management team has very limited experience in the lease-to-own industry. While we believe our FlexShopper business model will be successful, prior success of our senior management in other businesses should not viewed as an indication that we will be profitable. We can provide no assurances that our operations will ever be profitable.\nWe expect to require additional financing to achieve our business plans. We believe with our proprietary technology there is a significant market opportunity to expand the LTO market. However, the LTO market is subject to intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies. Accordingly, for our business plans to succeed we believe it will be important for us to move quickly to introduce our technology and capture market share. As a small company, we may be unable to successfully implement our ambitions of targeting very large markets in an intensely competitive industry segment without significantly increasing our resources. We do not currently have sufficient funds to fully implement our business plan. We expect that we will need to raise capital through new financings. Such financings could include equity financing, which may be dilutive to stockholders, or debt financing, which would likely restrict our ability to borrow from other sources. In addition, such securities may contain rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our current stockholders. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail or reduce our operations. We could be forced to sell or dispose of our rights or assets. Any inability to raise adequate funds on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition, including the possibility that a lack of funds could cause our business to fail and liquidate with little or no return to investors.\nOur business liquidity and capital resources are dependent upon our credit agreement with an institutional lender and our compliance with the terms thereof. On March 6, 2015, FlexShopper, through FlexShopper 2, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the \u201cBorrower\u201d), entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) among FlexShopper 2, LLC, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, various Lenders from time to time party thereto and WE2014-1, LLC (the \u201cLender\u201d). The Borrower is permitted to borrow funds under the Credit Agreement based on the Borrower\u2019s cash on hand and the Amortized Order Value of the Borrower\u2019s Eligible Leases (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement) less certain deductions described in the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Borrower may borrow up to $25,000,000 from the Lender for a term of two years; however, as of December 31, 2015, there was only approximately $15,380,000 in additional availability under the Credit Agreement. The borrowing term may be extended for an additional twelve months in the sole discretion of the Lender. The Credit Agreement contemplates that the Lender may provide additional debt financing to the Borrower, up to $100 million in total, under two uncommitted accordions following satisfaction of certain covenants and other terms and conditions. The Lender will receive security interests in certain leases as collateral under the Credit Agreement. For the term of the Credit Agreement, FlexShopper and its subsidiaries may not incur additional indebtedness (other than certain indebtedness expressly permitted under the Credit Agreement) without the permission of the Lender. The Lender and its affiliates will have a right of first refusal on certain subsequent FlexShopper transactions involving leases or other financial products during the term of the Credit Agreement and up to three months following the termination thereof. The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among others, failures to make payment of principal and interest, breaches or defaults under the terms of the Credit Agreement and related agreements entered into with the Lender, breaches of representations, warranties or certifications made by or on behalf of the Borrower in the Credit Agreement and related documents (including certain financial and expense covenants), deficiencies in the borrowing base, certain judgments against the Borrower and bankruptcy events.\nOn March 29, 2016, the Borrower entered into a fourth amendment and waiver (the \u201cFourth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, included a waiver of (i) breaches resulting from the Borrower\u2019s non-compliance with certain financial covenants under the Credit Agreement that occurred prior to the effectiveness of the Fourth Amendment and (ii) compliance with certain financial covenants under the Credit Agreement for the period from the date of the Fourth Amendment through the earlier of April 1, 2017 or the completion of a successful equity raise by the Company of at least $10,000,000 . If the Borrower is unable to regain compliance or another event of default occurs and is continuing, the Lender may, among other things, terminate any remaining commitments available to the Borrower, declare all outstanding principal and interest immediately due and payable and enforce any and all liens created in connection with the Credit Agreement. The occurrence of an event of default under the terms of our Credit Agreement may materially and adversely affect our operations.\nFlexShopper LTO revenue and earnings growth depend on our ability to execute our growth strategies. Our primary growth strategies are our FlexShopper LTO online products to consumers and utilization by retailers of FlexShopper\u2019s online channels to connect with customers that want to acquire products on a LTO basis. Effectively managing the development and growth can be challenging, particularly as we develop the management and operational systems necessary to develop this line of business. If we are unable to successfully execute these growth strategies, revenue from this line of business will grow slowly or not at all, and we may never achieve profitability.\nOur LTO business depends on the success of our third-party retail partners and our continued relationships with them. Our LTO revenues depend in part on the ability of unaffiliated third-party retailers to attract customers. In addition, in most cases, our agreements with such third-party retailers may be terminated at the retailer's election. The failure of our third-party retail partners to maintain quality and consistency in their operations and their ability to continue to provide products and services, or the loss of the relationship with any of these third-party retailers and an inability to replace them, could cause our LTO business to lose customers, substantially decreasing the revenues and earnings growth in our LTO business.\nOur growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands, and these efforts may be costly. Our ability to develop the FlexShopper brand will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services, and will require a continued focus on active marketing efforts. We will need to continue to spend substantial amounts of money on, and devote substantial resources to, advertising, marketing, and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among our customers. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, our business would be harmed.\nOur LTO business will depend on the continued growth of online and mobile commerce. The business of selling goods over the Internet and mobile networks is dynamic and relatively new. Concerns about fraud, privacy and other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting the Internet or mobile devices as modes of commerce, or may prompt consumers to offline channels. In order to expand our user base, we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods and may prefer Internet analogues to such traditional retail means, such as the retailer's own website, to our offerings. If these consumers prove to be less active than we expect due to lower levels of willingness to use the Internet or mobile devices for commerce for any reason, including lack of access to high-speed communications equipment, traffic congestion on the Internet or mobile network outages or delays, disruptions or other damage to users' computers or mobile devices, and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs, including our cost of acquiring new users, our business could be adversely impacted.\nThe success of our business is dependent on factors affecting consumer spending that are not under our control. Consumer spending is affected by general economic conditions and other factors including levels of employment, disposable consumer income, prevailing interest rates, consumer debt and availability of credit, costs of fuel, inflation, recession and fears of recession, tax rates and rate increases, timing of receipt of tax refunds, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and political conditions, and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security. Unfavorable changes in factors affecting discretionary spending could reduce demand for our products and services resulting in lower revenue and negatively impacting the business and its financial results.\nOur customer base presents significant risk of default for non-payment. We bear the risk of non-payment or slow payment by our customers. The nature of our customer base makes it sensitive to adverse economic conditions and less likely to meet our prevailing underwriting standards, which may be more restrictive in an adverse economic environment. As a result, during such periods we may experience decreases in the growth of new customers, and we may curtail spending limits to existing customers, which may adversely affect our net sales and potential profitability.\nOur customers can return merchandise without penalty. When our customers acquire merchandise through the FlexShopper LTO program, we actually purchase the merchandise from the retailer and enter the lease-to-own relationship with the customer. Because our customers can return merchandise without penalty, there is risk that we may end up owning a significant amount of merchandise that is difficult to monetize. While we have factored customer returns into our business model, customer return volume may exceed the levels we expect, which could adversely impact our collections, revenues and our financial performance. Returns totaled approximately $205,000 carrying value of leased merchandise during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nWe rely on third party credit/debit card and ACH (Automated Clearing House) processors to process collections from customers on a weekly basis. Our ability to collect from customers could be impaired if these processors do not work with us. These third-party payment processors may consider our business a high risk since our customer base could have a high incidence of insufficient funds and rejected payments. This could cause a processor to discontinue its services to us, and we may not be able to find a replacement processor. If this occurred, we would have to collect from our customers using less efficient methods, which could adversely impact our collections, revenues and our financial performance.\nWe rely on internal models to manage risk, to provide accounting estimates and to make other business decisions. Our results could be adversely affected if those models do not provide reliable estimates or predictions of future activity. The accurate modeling of risks is critical to our business, particularly with respect to managing underwriting and spending limits for our customers. Our expectations regarding customer repayment levels, as well as our allowances for doubtful accounts and other accounting estimates, are based in large part on internal modeling. We also rely heavily on internal models in making a variety of other decisions crucial to the successful operation of our business. It is therefore important that our models are accurate, and any failure in this regard could have a material adverse effect on our results. Models are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on historical data available to us and our assumptions about factors such as demand, payment rates, default rates, delinquency rates and other factors that may overstate or understate future experience. Our models could produce unreliable results for a number of reasons, including the limitations or lack of historical data to predict results, invalid or incorrect assumptions underlying the models, the need for manual adjustments in response to rapid changes in economic conditions, incorrect coding of the models, incorrect data being used by the models or inappropriate application of a model to products or events outside of the model\u2019s intended use. In particular, models are less dependable when the economic environment is outside of historical experience, as has been the case recently. Due to the factors described above, unanticipated and excessive default and charge-off experience can adversely affect our profitability and financial condition, breach covenants in future credit facilities, limit our ability to secure a credit facility and adversely affect our ability to finance our business.\nOur operations are regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, which may be amended or supplemented or interpreted by the courts from time to time, could expose us to significant compliance costs or burdens or force us to change our business practices in a manner that may be materially adverse to our operations, prospects or financial condition. Currently, 47 states and the District of Columbia specifically regulate rent-to-own, lease-to-own transactions. At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the rent-to-own industry, although federal legislation to regulate the industry has been proposed from time to time. Any adverse changes in existing laws, or the passage of new adverse legislation by states or the federal government could materially increase both our costs of complying with laws and the risk that we could be sued or be subject to government sanctions if we are not in compliance. In addition, new burdensome legislation might force us to change our business model and might reduce the economic potential of our sales and lease ownership operations. Most of the states that regulate rent-to-own transactions have enacted disclosure laws that require rent-to-own companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed and miscellaneous other items. The more restrictive state lease purchase laws limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the \"cost-of-rental\" amount that rent-to-own companies may charge on rent-to-own transactions, generally defining \"cost-of-rental\" as lease fees paid in excess of the \u201cretail\u201d price of the goods. There has been increased legislative attention in the United States, at both the federal and state levels, on consumer debt transactions in general, which may result in an increase in legislative regulatory efforts directed at the rent-to-own industry. We cannot guarantee that the federal government or states will not enact additional or different legislation that would be disadvantageous or otherwise materially adverse to us. In addition to the risk of lawsuits related to the laws that regulate rent-to-own and consumer lease transactions, we could be subject to lawsuits alleging violations of federal and/or state laws and regulations and consumer tort law, including fraud, consumer protection, information security and privacy laws, because of the consumer-oriented nature of the rent-to-own industry. A large judgment against FlexShopper could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, an adverse outcome from a lawsuit, even one against one of our competitors, could result in changes in the way we and others in the industry do business, possibly leading to significant costs or decreased revenues or profitability.\nFlexShopper\u2019s lease-to-own business differs in some potentially significant respects from the risks of traditional store-based lease-to-own businesses. The risks could have a material negative effect on FlexShopper. FlexShopper offers its lease-to-own products direct to consumers through its e-commerce marketplace and through the stores and e-commerce sites of third party retailers. Potential risks include, among others:\n\u25cf FlexShopper\u2019s reliance on third party retailers over whom FlexShopper cannot exercise control and oversight of certain business functions, from advertising through assistance with lease transaction applications;\n\u25cf possibly different regulatory risks due to the non-traditional, online nature of FlexShopper\u2019s business that regulators may target and/or new regulations or legislation could be adopted (or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted) that negatively impact FlexShopper\u2019s business; and\n\u25cf reliance on automatic bank account drafts for lease payments, which may become disfavored as a payment method for these transactions by regulators.\nIf we fail to protect the integrity and security of customer and employee information, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory enforcement, and our business could be adversely impacted. We collect and store certain personal information provided to us by our customers and employees in the ordinary course of our business. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or employee information. In addition, one of our employees, contractors or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or employee information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers, employees, regulators and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with privacy laws and costs incurred to prevent or remediate information security breaches, could adversely impact our business.\nThe loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business. Our future financial performance will depend to a significant extent on our ability to motivate and retain key management personnel. Further, FlexShopper is seeking to hire additional qualified management for its FlexShopper business. Competition for qualified management personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire additional qualified management on terms satisfactory to FlexShopper. Further, in the event we experience turnover in our senior management positions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit suitable replacements. We must also successfully integrate all new management and other key positions within our organization to achieve our operating objectives. Even if we are successful, turnover in key management positions may temporarily harm our financial performance and results of operations until new management becomes familiar with our business. At present, we do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of our executive officers, although we entered into an employment contract with Brad Bernstein, Chief Executive Officer and President. Our Board of Directors is responsible for approval of all future employment contracts with our executive officers. We can provide no assurances that said future employment contracts and/or their current compensation is or will be on commercially reasonable terms to us in order to retain our key personnel. The loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business.\nCompetition in the LTO business is intense. The lease-to-own industry is highly competitive. Our operation competes with other national, regional and local lease-to-own businesses, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Some of these companies have, or may develop, systems that enable consumers to obtain through online facilities spending limits and payment terms and to enter into leases nearly instantaneously, in a manner similar to that provided by FlexShopper\u2019s proprietary technology. Many of our competitors have substantially more resources and greater experience in the lease-to-own business of FlexShopper. With respect to customers desiring to purchase merchandise for cash or on credit, we also compete with retail stores. Competition is based primarily on store location, product selection and availability, customer service and lease rates and terms. We believe we do not currently have significant competition for our on-line LTO marketplace and patent pending LTO payment method. However, such competition is likely to develop over time, and we may be unable to successfully compete in our target markets. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to successfully compete in the LTO industry.\nChanges in regulations or customer concerns, in particular as they relate to privacy and protection of customer data, could adversely affect our business. Our business is subject to laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers. The interpretation and application of privacy and customer data protection laws are in a state of flux and may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our own privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other privacy or consumer protection related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect our operating results.\nSystem interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our order entry and online systems may adversely affect our net sales. Customer access to our customer service center and websites is key to the continued flow of new orders. Anything that would hamper or interrupt such access could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and customer satisfaction. Examples of risks that could affect access include problems with the Internet or telecommunication infrastructure, limited web access by our customers, local or more systemic impairment of computer systems due to viruses or malware, or impaired access due to breaches of Internet security or denial of service attacks. Changes in the policies of service providers or others that increase the cost of telephone or Internet access could inhibit our ability to market our products or transact orders with customers. In addition, our ability to operate our business from day-to-day largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems and communications systems. Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or denial of service attacks, improper operation by employees and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services or threaten our relationships with our third-party retail customers, all of which would impair our operations. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and we have not fully implemented a disaster recovery plan. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any related losses. Interruptions to customer ordering, particularly if prolonged, could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy and have significant adverse effects on our financial results.\nWe face risk related to the strength of our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure. We are exposed to operational risks that can be manifested in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees, contractors or third parties and exposure to external events. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems that we use to manage our internal financial, credit and other systems, interface with our customers and develop and implement effective marketing campaigns. Our ability to operate our business to meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones and to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on the functionality of our operational and technology systems. Any disruptions or failures of our operational and technology systems, including those associated with improvements or modifications to such systems, could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services and to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner, all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In some cases, we outsource delivery, maintenance and development of our operational and technological functionality to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. Any increase in the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to third parties may increase our exposure to these risks.\nIf we do not respond to technological changes, our services could become obsolete, and we could lose customers. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our e-commerce websites and other technologies. We may face material delays in introducing new products and enhancements. If this happens, our customers may forego the use of our websites and use those of our competitors. The Internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing. If competitors introduce new products and services using new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing websites and our proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete. Our failure to respond to technological change or to adequately maintain, upgrade and develop our computer network and the systems used to process customers\u2019 orders and payments could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. We have filed provisional patents for a system that enables consumers to buy products on a LTO basis using mobile devices and tablets and for a lease-to-own method of payment at check-out on e-commerce sites. We can provide no assurances that we will be granted any patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We regard our pending patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. In particular, we believe certain proprietary information, including but not limited to our underwriting model, and patent pending systems are central to our business model, and we believe give us a key competitive advantage. We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality, license and work product agreements with our employees, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring trademarks, service marks and domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Failure to protect our domain names could affect adversely our reputation and brand, and make it more difficult for users to find our website. We may be unable to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. In addition, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We can be at risk that others will independently develop or acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. The use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.\nWe cannot be certain that the intellectual property used in our business does not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and we are from time to time subject to third party infringement claims. Due to recent changes in patent law, we face the risk of a temporary increase in patent litigation due to new restrictions on including unrelated defendants in patent infringement lawsuits in the future particularly from entities that own patents but that do not make products or services covered by the patents. Any third party infringement claims against us, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us or the payment of damages. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement, we may be required to seek to enter into licensing agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn deciding whether to provide a spending limit to customers, we rely on the accuracy and completeness of information furnished to us by or on behalf of our customers. If we and our systems are unable to detect any misrepresentations in this information, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In deciding whether to provide a customer with a spending amount, we rely heavily on information furnished to us by or on behalf of our customers and our ability to validate such information through third-party services, including personal financial information. If a significant percentage of our customers intentionally or negligently misrepresent any of this information, and we or our systems do not or did not detect such misrepresentations, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively manage our risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to timely contact delinquent customers, then the number of delinquent customer receivables eventually being charged off could increase. We contact customers with delinquent account balances soon after the account becomes delinquent. During periods of increased delinquencies, it is important that we are proactive in dealing with these customers rather than simply allowing customer receivables to go to charge-off. During periods of increased delinquencies, it becomes extremely important that we are properly staffed and trained to assist customers in bringing the delinquent balance current and ultimately avoiding charge-off. If we do not properly staff and train our collections personnel, or if we incur any downtime or other issues with our information systems that assist us with our collection efforts, then the number of accounts in a delinquent status or charged-off could increase. In addition, managing a substantially higher volume of delinquent customer receivables typically increases our operational costs. A rise in delinquencies or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur management information systems may not be adequate to meet our evolving business and emerging regulatory needs and the failure to successfully implement them could negatively impact the business and its financial results. We are investing significant capital in new information technology systems to support our growth plan. These investments include redundancies, and acquiring new systems and hardware with updated functionality. We are taking appropriate actions to ensure the successful implementation of these initiatives, including the testing of new systems, with minimal disruptions to the business. These efforts may take longer and may require greater financial and other resources than anticipated, may cause distraction of key personnel, may cause disruptions to our systems and our business, and may not provide the anticipated benefits. The disruption in our information technology systems, or our inability to improve, integrate or expand our systems to meet our evolving business and emerging regulatory requirements, could impair our ability to achieve critical strategic initiatives and could adversely impact our sales, collections efforts, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity, our business could be adversely impacted. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as paper instrument counterfeiting, fraudulent payment or refund schemes and identity theft. As we make more of our services available over the internet and other media we subject ourselves to consumer fraud risk. We use a variety of tools to protect against fraud; however, these tools may not always be successful.\nOur failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls could result in inaccurate reporting of financial results and harm our business. We are required to comply with a variety of reporting, accounting and other rules and regulations. As such, we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, but there are limitations inherent in internal control systems. A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be appropriate relative to their costs. Furthermore, compliance with existing requirements is expensive and we may need to implement additional finance and accounting and other systems, procedures and controls to satisfy our reporting requirements. If our internal control over financial reporting is determined to be ineffective, such failure could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, negatively affect the market price of our common stock, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties, and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nControl of FlexShopper. Our secured lender described under this Item 1 and Item 7 and Item 13 below beneficially owns 28.0% of our outstanding Common Stock as of the filing date of this Form 10-K. Also, our executive officers and directors beneficially own an additional 25.5% of our Common Stock as of the same date. In the event that they act in concert on future stockholder matters, such persons may have the ability to affect the election of all of our directors and the outcome of all issues submitted to our stockholders. Such concentration of ownership could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Common Stock and could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us.\nWe have no established public market for our securities. Our outstanding Common Stock does not have an established trading market, although our Common Stock has been quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol \u201cFPAY.\u201d Trading in our Common Stock has been sporadic in the Over-the-Counter Market since it began in December 2007. The availability for sale of restricted securities pursuant to Rule 144 or otherwise could adversely affect the market for our Common Stock, if any. We can provide no assurances that an established public market will ever develop or be sustained for our Common Stock in the future.\nThe price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly. The market price for our Common Stock, if any, can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including the factors listed above, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; announcements of new services by our competitors or us; announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions; changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts; and other changes in general economic conditions. Because of this, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of our stockholders or others, and the market price for our Common Stock could fluctuate as a result. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our Common Stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our FlexShopper business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be dependent upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, applicable contractual restrictions and other such factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nOn February 8, 2016 our Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split within a range of no less than one-for-5 and no more than one-for-10 (the \u201creverse stock split range\u201d), which was subsequently approved by our stockholders on March 17, 2016. If we effect a reverse stock split within the reverse stock split range, the reverse stock split may not result in a proportionate increase in the price of our common stock. Our Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split within a range of no less than one-for-5 and no more than one-for-10, or the \u201creverse stock split range\u201d, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders on March 17, 2016. Our Board of Directors may effect a reverse stock split within the reverse stock split range in the event our Board of Directors determines that such reverse stock split is in the best interest of our stockholders and us. While our Board of Directors has not determined to effect a reverse stock split, it may determine that effecting a reverse stock split is necessary in connection with our ability to satisfy the initial listing requirements to support our application to be listed on an exchange. However, the effect of a reverse stock split upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with certainty, and the results of reverse stock splits by companies in similar circumstances have been varied. If the Board of Directors does effect a reverse stock split there can be no assurance that:\n\u2022 Our shares of common stock will trade at a price in proportion to the reduction in the number of outstanding shares resulting from the reverse shares split,\n\u2022\nThe reverse stock split will result in a per share price high enough to attract and retain employees and strategic partners,\n\u2022 The bid price of our shares of common stock after a reverse stock split can be maintained at or above the minimum bid price requirement of an exchange,\n\u2022 The liquidity of our shares of common stock will not be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares that would be outstanding after the reverse stock split,\n\u2022 Engaging in a reverse stock split will not be perceived in a negative manner by investors, analysts or other stock market participants, or\n\u2022 The reverse stock split will not result in some stockholders owning \u201codd-lots\u201d of less than 100 shares of common stock, potentially resulting in higher brokerage commissions and other transaction costs than the commissions and costs of transactions in \u201cround-lots\u201d of even multiples of 100 shares.\nIncreased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly impact our results of operations. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and new SEC regulations, may create difficulties for companies such as ours in understanding and complying with these laws and regulations. As a result of these difficulties and other factors, devoting the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards has resulted in and may in the future result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities. We also expect these developments to increase our legal compliance and financial reporting costs. In addition, these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. Moreover, we may be unable to comply with these new laws and regulations on a timely basis.\nThese developments could make it more difficult for us to retain qualified members of our board of directors, or qualified executive officers. We are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result. To the extent these costs are significant, our general and administrative expenses are likely to increase.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in future financings, the ownership interest of existing shareholders will be diluted and, as a result, our stock price may go down. We may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock. As a result, our existing shareholders will experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at a discount. For example, in connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, on March 6, 2015, FlexShopper raised approximately $8.6 million in net proceeds through direct sales of 17.0 million shares of FlexShopper common stock, to certain affiliates of the Lender and other accredited investors for a purchase price of $.55 per share at a time when the market price of our common stock was above this level. As other capital raising opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our shareholders will experience dilution and this dilution will be greater if we find it necessary to sell securities at a discount to prevailing market prices.", "PERMNO": 16458, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "FPAY"}
