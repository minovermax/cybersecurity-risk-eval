{"cik": "1162112", "company": "RigNet, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business has many risks. Factors that could materially affect our business, financial position, operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our common stock are described below. This information should be considered carefully, together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.\nA large portion of our business is subject to the volatility of the global oil and gas industry and our business is likely to fluctuate with the level of global activity for oil and natural gas exploration, development and production.\nOur business depends on the oil and natural gas industry and particularly on the level of activity for oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. Demand for our remote communication services and collaborative applications depends on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the regions in which we operate or may operate. Our business will suffer if these expenditures decline. Our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas depends largely upon prevailing market conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\nthe supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe supply and demand for drilling rigs and services;\n\u2022\noil and natural gas prices and expectations about future prices;\n\u2022\nthe expected rate of decline in production;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to influence and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\nthe level of production in non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nthe worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in oil or natural gas producing areas of the Middle East and other crude oil and natural gas producing regions or further acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe political and legislative framework governing the activities of oil and natural gas companies, including the impact of changing regulations and environmental and safety rules and policies, changes to regulations, rules and policies, following oil spills and other pollution by the oil and gas industry, and legislative and regulatory interest to limit or further regulate drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development and production technology;\n\u2022\nthe global economic environment; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternatives to fossil fuels.\nThe level of activity in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry has historically been volatile and cyclical. A material decline in oil and natural gas exploration, development or production activity levels could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel or the failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could compromise our ability to effectively manage our business and pursue our growth strategy.\nOur future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified key technical, development, sales, services and management personnel, including personnel in all of the various regions of the world in which we operate. The loss of key employees could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be costly and time consuming, could cause additional disruptions to our business, and could be unsuccessful. We cannot guarantee the continued employment of any of the members of our senior leadership team, who may depart our company for any number of reasons, such as other business opportunities, differing views on our strategic direction or other personal reasons. We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our employees.\nAs our stock price has declined, the retention effect from stock based long-term incentives has declined.\nWe recently experienced significant management turnover. In our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 2, 2015, we announced that Marty Jimmerson resigned from the position of Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer (CFO) effective as of the transition to the new CFO in December 2015.\nAs announced in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 8, 2015, Charles Schneider was appointed to serve as CFO in December 2015.\nAs announced in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 7, 2016, Marty Jimmerson, our former CFO, was appointed Interim Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and President, to replace Mark Slaughter, our prior CEO and President effective January 7, 2016. Marty Jimmerson\u2019s appointment will continue while we search for a permanent CEO and President.\nOur ability to efficiently manage our business and pursue our growth strategy depends on our ability to attract and retain a highly qualified CEO.\nIf oil prices experience further price declines, the market price for our stock may be adversely impacted.\nOil prices have undergone a significant and sustained decline since the recent peak in the second half of 2014. Recent volatility has seen WTI oil prices drop from a high of $107.26 on June 20, 2014, to a low of $26.21 on February 11, 2016. During this time, the closing price for our common stock as reported by NASDAQ declined from a high of $57.04 on July 14, 2014 to a low of $11.75 on February 11, 2016. This near term volatility may affect future prices in 2016 and beyond. The volatility of the energy markets makes it difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. Although we believe our customers will be dependent upon real-time voice and data communication services and systems integration solutions to optimize their oil and gas production and development in an environment with lower energy prices, a prolonged significant reduction in the price of oil and natural gas will likely affect drilling and production levels and therefore could affect demand and pricing for the communication services and systems integration solutions we provide. In addition, a prolonged significant reduction in energy prices could make it more difficult for us to collect outstanding account receivables from our customers. As such, if oil prices face continued stagnation or experience further price declines, our results of operations and the market price of our stock could be adversely impacted which could subject our stockholders to losses and us to takeover bids or lead to action by NASDAQ.\nAs oil and gas prices and market activity deteriorate, we may accept riskier contractual terms and conditions\nAs oil and gas prices and market prices deteriorate, as mentioned in the previous risk factor, we may accept riskier contractual terms and conditions. Accepting riskier contractual terms and conditions may be necessary to execute on our strategy of defending and expanding our market share in the current macro-economic environment. Examples of such terms and conditions include allowing for the customer to cancel, have reduced bandwidth or have a reduced scope of service under certain conditions. Additional examples of such terms include offering to pay a customer\u2019s cancellation fees or remaining term of a remote communications contract with a competitor in exchange for switching to us as their remote communications provider. Such terms and conditions may have an adverse impact on our contractual recourse, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have contractual commitments, under certain conditions, for the purchase of GX space segment, and in the event that the GX Ka band service does not perform as expected or is not accepted by our customers, we may not be able to resell the capacity or may only be able to make sales at prices that impair our margins and financial results.\nWe do not own, lease or operate satellites. We acquire space segment capacity from various providers. Historically, we have purchased space segment, on a regional basis, in contract amounts up to $5.0 million, primarily C band and Ku band. We have historically had multiple contracts with each provider. In 2014, we entered into an agreement with Inmarsat to purchase, under certain conditions, up to $65.0 million of Ka segment on Inmarsat\u2019s GX system over five years. The GX system operates over geo-synchronous orbits rather than medium orbits. This commitment is subject to a number of commercial, technical and other requirements, which if not met, reduce the Company\u2019s obligations below $65.0 million. Some of this capacity is already available but is expected to be fully available sometime in 2016. This Ka band capacity is expected to supplement a portion of existing Ku and C band services. In the event that the new GX service does not perform as expected, is not accepted by a portion of our customers as expected or is not sold at acceptable prices, our margins and financial results could be adversely impacted. The GX system deployment will\nrequire capital expenditures to place new equipment with our customers, and if the GX system is not successful, we will not be able to earn the financial returns consistent with prior investments and our margins and financial results could be adversely impacted.\nOur revenue and earnings are largely dependent on the award of new contracts that we do not directly control.\nA substantial portion of our revenue and earnings is generated from large-scale and increasingly international project awards. The timing of when project awards will be made is unpredictable and largely outside of our control. We operate in highly competitive markets where it is difficult to predict whether and when we will receive awards since these awards and projects often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors including financing contingencies, commodity prices, overall market and economic conditions, governmental and environmental approvals. In addition, we may not win contracts that we have bid upon due to price, a client\u2019s perception of our ability to perform and/or perceived technology advantages held by others. In these highly competitive times, many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or terms and conditions in a contract that we might not deem market or acceptable. Because a significant portion of our revenue is generated from large projects, our results of operations can fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on whether and when project awards occur and the commencement date and progress of work under any awarded contracts. As a result, we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors or the risk that revenue may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated.\nDelays in the timing of the awards or potential cancellations of such prospects as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our long-term projected results. Since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts.\nMany of our contracts with customers may be terminated by our customers on short notice without penalty, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCustomers may switch service providers without incurring significant expense relative to the annual cost of the service. Our agreements generally provide that in the event of prolonged loss of service or for other good reasons, our customers may terminate service without penalty. In addition, many of our customer agreements may be terminated by our customers for no reason and upon short notice. Terms of customer agreements typically vary with a range from short-term call out work to three years, with some customer agreement terms as long as five years. Work orders placed under such agreements may have shorter terms than the relevant customer agreement. As a result, we may not be able to retain our customers through the end of the terms specified in the customer agreements. If we are not able to retain our customers, we would not receive expected revenues and may continue to incur costs, such as costs to secure satellite bandwidth under agreements with third-party satellite communication services providers which may not be as easily or as quickly terminated without penalty, resulting in harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of a drilling contractor customer site can also limit or eliminate our ability to provide services to other customers on the affected drilling rigs.\nMost of our contracts are on a fixed price basis and if our costs increase, we may not be able to recover these cost increases.\nMost of our contracts provide for a fixed price per month for our communications services and for a fixed price for our TSI projects. If our costs to provide those services increase, such as the cost to secure bandwidth or the cost to secure personnel or labor, we may not be able to offset our increased costs by increasing the rates we charge our customers until our next contract renewal, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to resolve the contractual dispute with a certain TSI customer could harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nAs disclosed in Note 10 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Consolidated Financial statements included in this Annual Report on form 10-K, our TSI business has a dispute related to a contract associated with a percentage completion project. We believe these amounts, which the customer is disputing, are owed under a customer contract where we have a contractual right to payment for work related to certain change orders. The Company has initiated the dispute resolution process under the contract and is actively working with the customer to resolve the matter.\nOur ability to resolve the dispute could take significant time, management attention and expense. The ultimate outcome of the dispute or actual loss from the project could harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe TSI line of service brings risks that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nTo sustain results from our systems integration business, we must maintain a backlog or pipeline of future projects. Demand for systems integration projects is dependent on the capital expenditure budgets for systems integration projects of our customers in the global business of exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. Reductions in our customers\u2019 capital expenditure budgets for systems integration projects can have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nA large portion of our systems integration profits and revenues are accounted for under the percentage of completion accounting methodology which has unique risks described below in the risk factor \u201cOur use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue or profits.\u201d\nA large portion of systems integration projects are pursuant to fixed price contracts. If we fail to successfully keep costs to the budgeted margin or are unable to purchase or contract for equipment, supplies and labor at budgeted costs and in a timely manner we may suffer losses.\nTSI contracts are generally priced based in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on assumptions including the price and availability of labor, equipment and materials as well as productivity, performance and future economic conditions. If these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of equipment and materials or our suppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred. Additionally, we may be required to pay liquidated damages upon our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts. Our failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for fixed-price contracts or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame and costs committed could result in reduced profits or, in certain cases, a loss for that contract. If the contract is significant, or we encounter issues that impact multiple contracts, cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. In some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue or profits.\nUnder our accounting policies, we measure and recognize a large portion of our TSI profits and revenue under the percentage-of-completion accounting methodology. This methodology allows us to recognize revenue and profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the cost incurred to date against the total amount of cost expected to be incurred. The effect of revisions to revenue and estimated cost is recorded when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated. These revisions can occur at any time and could result in a material reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue or profits.\nOur resource reallocation and restructuring activities may negatively impact our operations.\nIn 2015, we instituted a series of measures designed to reduce costs and improve our competitive position. As part of these measures, we incurred pre-tax expense of approximately $7.4 million in 2015, consisting primarily of employee separation costs and costs associated with closing certain company locations.\nReductions in personnel may adversely affect or delay various sales, marketing and product development programs and operational activities and could have negative effects on our internal control over financial reporting. These resource reallocation activities could be disruptive to our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nAdditionally, the Company may have additional future cost saving activities, which could be disruptive to our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur ability to retain customers depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour successful execution of marketing and sales strategies, including the acceptance of our value proposition; service delivery and customer care activities, including new account set up and billing; and our credit and collection policies;\n\u2022\nOur ability to fund necessary capital expenditures as required by our customers\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully obtain additional financing for the continued operation and build-out of our systems and networks;\n\u2022\nactual or perceived quality and coverage of our networks;\n\u2022\npublic perception about our brands;\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate and develop new or enhanced technologies, products and services that are attractive to existing or potential customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to access additional bandwidth at competitive rates;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, hire and maintain qualified personnel to meet customers\u2019 needs;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain and develop new sites for the placement of our equipment to provide our services; and\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new technologies, products and services that may be introduced by our competitors, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic conditions, and discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by our competitors.\nOur failure to retain customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly competitive and if we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nThe telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect both product and pricing competition to persist and intensify. Increased competition could cause reduced revenue, price reductions, reduced profits and loss of market share. Our industry is characterized by competitive pressures to provide enhanced functionality for the same or lower price with each new generation of technology. As the prices of our services decrease, we will need to sell more services and/or reduce the per-site costs to improve or maintain our results of operations. Historically, our primary global competitor has been Harris Corporation\u2019s Harris CapRock Communications. Recently ITC Global, backed by a private equity investment firm, as well as Speedcast and Tampnet have begun to expand their presence as active providers of satellite communications services to the oil and gas, mining and maritime markets. We also compete with regional competitors in the countries in which we operate. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial resources. Their greater financial resources may also make them better able to withstand downturns in the market, to expand into new areas more aggressively or to operate in developing markets without immediate financial returns. In addition, in certain markets outside of the U.S., we face competition from local competitors that provide their services at a lower price due to lower overhead costs, including lower costs of complying with applicable government regulations and their willingness to provide services for a lower profit margin. Strong competition and significant investments by competitors to develop new and better solutions may make it difficult for us to maintain our customer base, force us to reduce our prices or increase our costs to develop new solutions.\nFurthermore, competition may emerge from companies that we have previously not perceived as competitors or consolidation of our industry may cause existing competitors to become bigger and stronger with more resources, market awareness and market share. As we expand into new markets and geographic regions we may experience increased competition from some of our competitors that have prior experience or other business in these markets or geographic regions. In addition, some of our customers may decide to insource some of the communications services\nand managed services solutions that we provide, in particular our terrestrial communication services (e.g., terrestrial Line-of-Sight (LOS) transport, microwave, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, or WiMAX), which do not require the same level of maintenance and support as our other services. Our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competitive forces, to adapt to technological advances, to develop more advanced products more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors, to continue to develop and deepen our global sales and business development network, and to educate potential customers about the benefits of using our solutions rather than our competitors\u2019 products and services or in sourced solutions. Our failure to successfully respond to these competitive challenges could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and if we fail to keep up with these changes or if access to telecommunications in remote locations becomes easier or less expensive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nThe communications industry is characterized by rapid changes in technology, new evolving standards, emerging competition and frequent new product and service introductions. As an example of technological change that could impact our business, some remote communications providers are offering the use of Ka-band satellite service, instead of or in addition to the Ku-band and C-band satellite space segments used today. Ka-band services over medium orbit satellites are already available. This might impair our business if other providers are more successful than us in using Ka-band services to meet customer needs.\nOur future business prospects largely depend on our ability to meet changing customer preferences, to anticipate and respond to technological changes and to develop competitive products. If alternative telecommunications services to remote locations becomes more readily accessible or less expensive than our services, our business will suffer. New disruptive technologies could make our VSAT-based networks or other services obsolete or less competitive than they are today, requiring us to reduce the prices that we are able to charge for our services or causing us to undergo expensive transitions to new transport technologies. We may not be able to successfully respond to new technological developments and challenges or identify and respond to new market opportunities, services or products offered by competitors. In addition, our efforts to respond to technological innovations and competition may require significant capital investments and resources. Furthermore, we may not have the necessary resources to respond to new technological changes and innovations and emerging competition. Failure to keep up with future technological changes could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our potential clients are resistant to new solutions and technologies which may limit our growth.\nAlthough there is a strong focus on technology development within the oil and gas industry, some of the companies in the upstream oil and gas industry are relatively conservative and risk averse with respect to adopting new solutions and technologies in the area of remote communications due to these services being so integral to highly-complex drilling, completion and production operations. Some drilling contractors, oil and gas companies and oilfield service companies may choose not to adopt new solutions and technology, such as our remote communications and collaboration applications solutions, which may limit our growth potential.\nOur information systems and network are protected by certain cyber security measures, and in the event that the cyber security measures fail or are otherwise not adequate, our systems may be damaged which could harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe have in place layered cyber security systems designed to protect against certain events, including intentional or unintentional disruption, failure, misappropriation or corruption of our network and information systems. Events of this type might be caused by computer hacking, malware, computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, \u201ccyber-attacks\u201d and other malicious activity, as well as natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks and similar events. Such events could have an adverse impact on us and our customers, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers and damage to our facilities, equipment and data. In addition, we could be adversely affected by the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential customer data or intellectual property. Operational or business delays may result from the disruption of network or information systems and the subsequent remediation activities. Moreover, these events may create negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers. In addition, the networks and information systems of our third-party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to the events described above. Our customer contracts, in general, do not contain provisions which would protect us against liability to third-parties with whom our customers conduct business. Although we have implemented and intend to continue to implement industry standard cyber practices and cyber security systems, these systems may prove to be inadequate and result in the disruption, failure, misappropriation\nor corruption of our network and information systems. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against these events or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by these events or the failure or inadequacy of our security systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting our accounting and back office functions; failure of our information technology infrastructure to operate effectively could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our back office functions of accounting, invoicing, purchasing, requisitioning, performing management\u2019s analysis of results and payroll. We continue to update and enhance our information systems. If a problem occurs that impairs or compromises this infrastructure, including security breaches or malicious attacks, or problems with systems upgrades and/or new systems implementations, the resulting disruption could impede our ability to perform accounting, invoice, process orders, protect sensitive data of the Company, our customers, our suppliers and business partners, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers and/or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate, including as a result of legal claims or proceedings. Additionally, any such events could adversely harm our legal, accounting and compliance capabilities including but not limited to: our ability to timely file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); timely file financial statements required by certain statutes; timely file compliance reports with our lenders under our credit agreement; and timely file income taxes with the IRS, foreign taxing authorities, and with local taxing authorities.\nThe implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could cause disruption to the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company is in the process of implementing a new ERP system. The Company has implemented the ERP in the Western Hemisphere Reportable Segment, excluding Brazil, and expects to fully transition to the new ERP across the entire Company as early as 2016. The Company anticipates that significant internal and external resources will be required. However, if the implementation of the ERP does not proceed as expected, it could negatively impact the Company\u2019s current operating service levels, its system of internal controls over financial reporting, require additional resources and significant financial commitments, result in potential transition delays, impede the Company\u2019s ability to order materials, generate management reports, invoice customers, and comply with laws and regulations. Any of these types of disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the financial position and the financial results of the Company.\nThe termination or non-renewal of the SOIL management agreement could negatively affect financial results we recognize from the SOIL network operations.\nThe North Sea consortium of companies who collectively oversee SOIL have contracted with us to operate this private extranet for them. This North Sea consortium of companies may find alternatives to the SOIL service that could cause them to terminate or not renew the current SOIL service with us. If the consortium of companies choose to eliminate the SOIL service, find an alternative communications solution, or if they contract with another provider to manage SOIL operations, our financial results would be harmed.\nWe compete for satellite capacity for our services and any capacity constraints could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete for satellite capacity with a number of commercial entities, such as broadcasting companies, and governmental entities, such as the military. In certain markets, the availability and pricing of capacity could be subject to competitive pressure, such as during renewals. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure the capacity needed to conduct our operations at current rates or levels going forward. The inability to obtain sufficient satellite bandwidth on commercially reasonable terms could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In certain markets, the availability of bandwidth may be restricted by local governments when needed to support military operations, and in the event of such an action, there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure the capacity needed to conduct our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business. Failures by third-party providers could harm our business and reputation and result in loss of customers and revenue.\nA significant part of our operations and growth depends on third-party providers delivering reliable communications connections, networks, equipment, maintenance, repair and satellite transponder capacity, subjecting our business, reputation and customer revenue to risks beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\ntelecommunications failures;\n\u2022\nsaturation of communication connection points, networks and third-party facilities;\n\u2022\nin-orbit risks for satellites including malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, and collisions with meteoroids, decommissioned spacecraft or other space debris;\n\u2022\nsatellite manufacturing or control system errors;\n\u2022\nlack of communication service alternatives, including failure of satellite providers to timely replace aging satellites with more modern technology and updated capacities;\n\u2022\nconnecting to faulty equipment;\n\u2022\nhuman error;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\nunexpected equipment failure;\n\u2022\npower loss;\n\u2022\nlabor strikes or work stoppages;\n\u2022\nunauthorized access or security risks; and\n\u2022\nsabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism.\nUnder most of our contracts with satellite service providers, our satellite service providers do not indemnify us for such loss or damage to our business resulting from certain risks, including satellite failures. If any potential claims result in liabilities, we could be required to pay damages or other penalties, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we take precautions, the occurrence of any of these risks or other unanticipated problems arising from third-party services could result in interruption in the services we provide to customers. Any of these occurrences could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we rely upon and expect to continue to rely upon a limited number of third-party suppliers to supply the equipment required to provide our services, such as the equipment we install on offshore drilling rigs in order to provide remote communication services. Although this equipment is commercially available from more than one supplier, there are a limited number of suppliers of such equipment. Further, price and quality vary among suppliers. If the suppliers enter into competition with us, or if our competitors enter into exclusive or restrictive arrangements with our suppliers, the availability and pricing of the equipment that we purchase could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we prefer to use a small group of suppliers and standardized equipment as much as possible so that we are installing generally the same equipment and therefore can maintain smaller quantities of replacement parts and equipment in our warehouses. If we need to change suppliers for any reason, we will incur additional costs due to the lack of uniformity and need to warehouse a broader array of replacement parts and equipment. In addition, we typically rely on our equipment suppliers to obtain authorizations or type-approvals to operate the supplier\u2019s equipment in the various countries we offer services. If, due to a highly protectionist country, our supplier or RigNet is not able to obtain such equipment type-approvals from that country\u2019s regulator, we will not be able to operate that particular equipment and our pool of available suppliers will be reduced.\nFurther, significant portions of the work performed under our systems integration contracts rely upon third-party suppliers for equipment and materials. If the amounts we are required to pay for equipment and supplies exceed what we have estimated, especially in a fixed-price systems integration contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier fails to provide supplies or equipment as required under a negotiated contract for any reason, or provides supplies or equipment that are not an acceptable quality, we may be required to source those supplies or equipment on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could negatively impact contract profitability. In addition, faulty equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications or time tables. These risks may be intensified if these suppliers experience financial difficulties or\nfind it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to fund their operations or access to bonding, and are not able to provide the materials or supplies necessary for our business. In addition, in instances where we rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of contracted suppliers, there can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these products in a timely manner, or at the costs we had anticipated. A failure by a supplier to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business.\nAny failure on our part to perform under our customer service contracts due to the failures of our third-party providers could result in: (i) loss of revenue despite continued obligations under our contractual arrangements; (ii) possible cancellation of customer contracts; (iii) incurrence of additional expenses to reposition customer antennas to alternative satellites or otherwise find alternate service; (iv) incurrence of additional expenses to replace existing equipment due to lack of continued availability of such equipment or repair parts; (v) breach of contract claims; and (vi) damage to our reputation, which could negatively affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new business.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers and the loss of any of these customers would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to diversify our customer base but still receive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of large customers, among them being Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Ensco Plc, Seadrill, Noble Corporation Plc and Paragon Offshore Plc. Although none of these customers represents more than 10% of our annual revenue, should a material customer terminate or significantly reduce its business with us, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed.\nBad weather in the Gulf of Mexico or other areas where we operate could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain areas in and near the Gulf of Mexico and other areas in which our clients operate experience unfavorable weather conditions, including hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions, on a relatively frequent basis. A major storm or threat of a major storm in these areas may harm our business. Our clients\u2019 drilling rigs, production platforms and other vessels in these areas are susceptible to damage and/or total loss by these storms, which may cause them to no longer need our communication services. Our equipment on these rigs, platforms or vessels could be damaged causing us to have service interruptions and lose business or incur significant costs for the replacement of such equipment. Even the threat of a very large storm will sometimes cause our clients to limit activities in an area and thus harm our business. Increased unfavorable weather conditions could impair satellite connectivity, cause more sites to be shut down and generally cause activities to be limited so that our business may be harmed. This risk is more pronounced for Line-of-Site (LOS) microwave service, as there is a likely loss of service for multiple subsequent microwave sites in the network relay.\nThe microwave network acquired as part of the Inmarsat transaction is a Line-of-Site (LOS) systems and the failure of one site in the microwave network will likely lead to disruption of service for subsequent microwave sites in the network relay.\nA LOS system operates by relaying microwave communications from one microwave site to another that are within visible sight of another in a microwave relay leg. Although the Company makes reasonable attempts to build redundancy into the microwave system, when a microwave site on a microwave relay is rendered inoperable subsequent dependent sites are also rendered inoperable. As such the risk of a microwave site being rendered inoperable by weather, technical failure or other means will likely cascade to other dependent microwave sites. We do not insure for loss of a microwave site or business interruption caused by the loss of such a site as we believe the cost of such insurance outweighs the risk of potential loss.\nAny loss of a rig on which our equipment is located will likely lead to a complete loss of our equipment on that rig and a loss of the revenue related to that rig.\nAt the commencement of a new service contract for a rig, we generally install approximately $0.1 million to $0.6 million and as high as $1.0 million worth of equipment on each offshore drilling rig. If a rig were to sink or incur substantial damage for any reason, we would most likely lose all of our equipment. We do not insure for such losses as we believe the cost of such insurance outweighs the risk of potential loss. In addition to the loss of the equipment, we would likely lose the revenue related to that rig under the terms of most of our existing contracts. Also, we may be committed to paying the costs to secure satellite bandwidth for that rig under agreements with third-party satellite communication providers even after the rig is no longer in service. Losses of rigs can occur as a result of catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fire or sinking. Such catastrophic events can occur without notice, but have historically been infrequent.\nChanges in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations.\nOur U.S. services are provided on a private carrier basis. As such, these services are subject to light or no regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state public utility commissions (PUCs). If the FCC or one or more PUCs determine that these services or the services of our subsidiaries or affiliates constitute common carrier offerings, we may be subject to significant costs to ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of those laws and regulations. We may be subject to enforcement actions including, but not limited to, fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties if we fail to comply with those requirements.\nIn 2014, we completed the purchase of Inmarsat\u2019s Enterprise Energy business unit which included services, facilities and licenses, including fixed microwave licenses, very small aperture terminal (VSAT) earth station licenses, various private and commercial mobile radio service licenses, broadband radio licenses and leases for wireless communications service licenses. RigNet also acquired authorization to provide intrastate telecommunications services in two states: Texas and Louisiana. As a result of these additional product and service offerings and the multiple licenses acquired from Inmarsat, during 2014, RigNet was subject to more expansive, and in some cases, more stringent regulation by the FCC and state public utility commissions than in the past. As part of the Inmarsat integration process, RigNet rescinded its Competitive Local Exchange Carrier status in Texas and Louisiana and its Interexchange Carrier status in Texas, as well as its international 214 license, to align its regulatory position as a private carrier only.\nThe following is a summary of the regulatory environment in which we currently operate and does not describe all present and proposed international, federal, state and local legislation and regulations affecting the communications industry, some of which may change the way the industry operates as a result of administrative or judicial proceedings or legislative initiatives. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters or the impact on our business.\nAs an evolving non-dominant international and domestic carrier under the U.S. Communications Act, as amended (the Act), among other requirements, RigNet must pay various fees including contribution of a percentage of its revenues from telecommunications services to the FCC\u2019s Universal Service Fund and other federal program funds to subsidize certain user segments, file various reports, comply with rules that protect customer information and the processing of emergency calls, and obtain regulatory approval prior to withdrawing from the provision of regulated service or any assignment of authorization or any transfer of legal or actual control of the Company. RigNet is also subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) and associated FCC regulations which require telecommunications service providers and VoIP providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement authorities.\nLike the FCC, the state PUCs impose various regulatory fees, universal service, reporting and prior approval requirements for transfer or assignments. The FCC and state PUCs have jurisdiction to hear complaints regarding the compliance or non-compliance with these and other common carrier requirements of the Act and the FCC\u2019s rules, and similar state laws.\nIf the FCC or a state PUCs determines that RigNet has not complied with federal and/or state regulatory requirements, we may be subject to enforcement actions including, but not limited to, fines, cease and desist orders, license revocation, or other penalties.\nOur international operations are also regulated by various non-U.S. governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards and requirements. The adoption of new laws or regulations, changes to the existing regulatory framework, new interpretations of the laws that apply to our operations, or the loss of, or a material limitation on, any of our material licenses could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to the FCC\u2019s Universal Service Fund (USF) Regime or state universal service fund regimes or findings that we have not complied with USF requirements or state universal service fund regimes may adversely affect our financial condition.\nSeveral proceedings pending before the FCC have the potential to significantly alter our Universal Service Fund (USF) contribution obligations. The FCC is considering: (1) changing the basis upon which USF contributions are determined from a revenue percentage measurement, as well as increasing the breadth of the USF contribution base to include certain services now exempt from contribution; (2) the classification of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS); and (3) the classification of various IP-enabled services. Adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our costs of providing service. We are unable to predict the timing or outcome of this proceeding.\nWe cannot predict the application and impact of changes to the federal or state USF contribution requirements on the communications industry generally and on certain of our business activities in particular. Changes in the federal or state USF requirements or findings that we have not met our obligations could materially increase our USF contributions and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to a variety of regulatory actions that may affect our ability to operate.\nTelecommunications regulators have the right to sanction a service provider or to revoke licenses if a service provider violates applicable laws or regulations. If any regulatory agency were to conclude that we were providing telecommunications services without the appropriate authority or are otherwise not in compliance with applicable regulations, the agency could initiate enforcement actions, which could result in, among other things, revocation of authority, the imposition of fines, a requirement to disgorge revenues, or refusal to grant regulatory authority necessary for the future provision of services.\nIf we infringe or if third parties assert that we infringe third-party intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs and incur significant harm to our business.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us, which could result in substantial damages if it is ultimately determined that our services infringe a third-party\u2019s proprietary rights. Even if claims are without merit, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention from our other business concerns.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any failure or inability to sufficiently protect them could harm our business and our operating results.\nWe own, and maintain certain intellectual property assets, including copyright and trademarks, trade secrets, and rights to certain domain names, which we believe are collectively among our most valuable assets. We seek to protect our intellectual property assets through the laws of the U.S. and other countries of the world, and through contractual provisions. However, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property assets and proprietary rights might not be sufficient or effective at stopping unauthorized use of those rights. Protection of the distinctive elements of RigNet might not always be available under copyright law or trademark law, or we might not discover or determine the full extent of any unauthorized use of our copyrights and trademarks in order to protect our rights. In addition, effective trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret protection might not be available or cost-effective in every country in which our products and services are distributed. With respect to maintaining our trade secrets, we have entered into confidentiality agreements with most of our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with many of the parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. However, these agreements might be breached and our trade secrets might be compromised by outside parties or by our employees, which could cause us to lose any competitive advantage provided by maintaining our trade secrets. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use, the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced. In addition, protecting our intellectual property and other proprietary rights is expensive and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and consequently harm our operating results.\nOur international operations are subject to additional or different risks than our United States operations, which may harm our business and financial results.\nWe operate in approximately 50 countries around the world, including countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Europe and intend to continue to expand the number of countries in which we operate. However,\nbecause operations in some countries may be temporary, the total number of countries fluctuates. There are many risks inherent in conducting business internationally that are in addition to or different than those affecting our United States operations, including:\n\u2022\nsometimes vague and confusing regulatory requirements that may be subject to unexpected changes or interpretations;\n\u2022\nimport and export restrictions;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically dispersed operations and culturally diverse work forces;\n\u2022\nincreased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\ndifferences in employment laws and practices among different countries, including restrictions on terminating employees;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nimposition of currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\npotential political and economic instability in some regions;\n\u2022\nlegal and cultural differences in the conduct of business;\n\u2022\nlack of traditional concepts of due process and sometimes arbitrary application of laws and sanctions, including criminal charges and arrests;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in raising awareness of applicable United States laws to our agents and third-party intermediaries;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and timely collecting receivables;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expense of maintaining international sales distribution channels; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining and protecting our intellectual property.\nOperating internationally exposes our business to increased regulatory and political risks in some non-U.S. jurisdictions where we operate. In addition to changes in laws and regulations, changes in governments or changes in governmental policies in these jurisdictions may alter current interpretation of laws and regulations affecting our business. We also face increased risk of incidents such as war or other international conflict and nationalization, and possible expropriation of our assets. If a non-U.S. country were to nationalize our industry or expropriate our assets, we could lose not only our investment in the assets that we have in that country, but also all of our contracts and business in that country.\nMany of the countries in which we operate have legal systems that are less developed and less predictable than legal systems in Western Europe or the United States. It may be difficult for us to obtain effective legal redress in the courts of some jurisdictions, whether in respect of a breach of law or regulation, or in an ownership dispute because of: (i) a high degree of discretion on the part of governmental authorities, which results in less predictability; (ii) a lack of judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting applicable rules and regulations; (iii) inconsistencies or conflicts between or within various laws, regulations, decrees, orders and resolutions; (iv) the relative inexperience of the judiciary and courts in such matters or (v) a predisposition in favor of local claimants against United States companies. Similarly, many of our contracts are governed by the laws of these countries, which may create both legal and practical difficulties in case of a dispute or conflict. We operate in regions where the ability to protect contractual and other legal rights may be limited. In addition, having to pursue arbitration or litigation in some countries may be more difficult or expensive than pursuing litigation in the United States.\nIn certain jurisdictions, the commitment of local business people, government officials and agencies and the judicial system to abide by legal requirements and negotiated agreements may be unreliable. In particular, agreements may be susceptible to revision or cancellation and legal redress may be uncertain or time-consuming. Actions of governmental authorities or officers may adversely affect joint ventures, licenses, license applications or other legal arrangements, and such arrangements in these jurisdictions may not be effective or enforced.\nThe authorities in the countries where we operate may introduce additional regulations for the oil and gas and communications industries with respect to, but not limited to, various laws governing prospecting, development, production, taxes, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use, labor standards, occupational health network access and other matters. New rules and regulations may be enacted or existing rules and regulations may be applied or interpreted in a manner which could limit our ability to provide our services. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities in the oil and gas industry and telecommunications industry could harm our operations and financial results. Compliance with and changes in tax laws or adverse positions taken by taxing authorities could be costly and could affect our operating results.\nCompliance related tax issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries. Changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various taxing authorities, disagreements with taxing authorities over our tax positions and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits could have a significant financial impact on our future operations and the way we conduct, or if we conduct, business in the affected countries.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. Export Control Laws that have stringent compliance standards for us.\nWe are subject to a number of applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States as well as comparable laws of other countries. We cannot provide services to certain countries subject to United States trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control of the United States Department of the Treasury or the United States Department of Commerce unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations. If our customers move their sites into countries subject to certain sanctions, we may not be able to serve them, in which case, our revenues will be adversely impacted and we may have additional costs incurred as well. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that, generally, prohibits bribes or unreasonable gifts to non-U.S. governments or officials and may be subject to anti-corruption laws of other countries in which the Company may operate or may otherwise have a substantial business connection. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements, and more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. In certain countries, we engage third-party agents or intermediaries to act on our behalf in dealings with government officials, such as customs agents, and if these third-party agents or intermediaries violate applicable laws, their actions may result in penalties or sanctions being assessed against us.\nWe may incur additional expenses and not be able to comply with SEC reporting requirements related to conflict minerals.\nIn August 2012, the SEC adopted new rules establishing additional disclosure and reporting requirements regarding a company\u2019s use of conflict minerals. These SEC rules could result in us incurring additional costs to document and perform supplier due diligence. As these rules will likely impact our suppliers, the availability of raw materials used in our operations could be negatively impacted and or raw material prices could increase. We may also have difficulty verifying the supply of conflict minerals to their source and, therefore, may not be able to comply with the SEC\u2019s conflict minerals reporting requirement.\nMany of our contracts are governed by the laws of countries that may make them difficult or expensive to interpret or enforce.\nMany of our contracts are governed by the laws of countries other than the U. S., which may create both legal and practical difficulties in case of a dispute or conflict. We operate in regions where the ability to protect contractual and other legal rights may be limited. In addition, having to pursue arbitration or litigation in some countries may be more difficult or expensive than pursuing litigation in the United States.\nWe may face difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals for our provision of telecommunication services, and we may face changes in regulation, each of which could adversely affect our operations.\nIn a number of countries where we operate, the provision of telecommunication services is highly regulated. In such countries, we are required to obtain approvals from national and local authorities in connection with most of the services that we provide. In many jurisdictions, we must maintain such approvals through compliance with license conditions or payment of annual regulatory fees.\nMany of our customers utilize our services on mobile vessels or drilling platforms that may enter into new countries on short notice. If we do not already have a license to provide our service in that country, we may be required to obtain a license or other regulatory approval on short notice, which may not be feasible in some countries. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could subject us to various sanctions including fines, penalties, arrests or criminal charges, loss of authorizations and the denial of applications for new authorizations or for the renewal of existing authorizations or cause us to delay or terminate our service to such vessel or platform until such license or regulatory approval may be obtained. In some areas of international waters, it is ambiguous as to which country\u2019s regulations apply, if any, and thus difficult and costly for us to determine which licenses or other regulatory approvals we should obtain.\nIn such areas, we could be subject to various penalties or sanctions if we fail to comply with the applicable country\u2019s regulations.\nFuture changes to the regulations under which we operate could make it difficult for us to obtain or maintain authorizations, increase our costs or make it easier or less expensive for our competitors to compete with us.\nAcquisitions bring new risks that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe expect to acquire and have a history of acquiring businesses, assets, technologies or products to enhance our business in the future if appropriate opportunities become available. In connection with any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u2022\nissue additional equity securities which would dilute our current stockholders;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions; or\n\u2022\nassume significant liabilities.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties integrating the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs and other liabilities, diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business, adverse effects on existing business relationships with current and/or prospective partners, customers and/or suppliers, risks associated with entering markets and business lines in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. We may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses, assets, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future without a significant expenditure of operating, financial and management resources, if at all. The integration process could divert management time from focusing on operating our business, result in a decline in employee morale or cause retention issues to arise from changes in compensation, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the business.\nAcquisitions may also require us to record goodwill, non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may acquire companies that have insufficient internal financial controls, which could impair our ability to integrate the acquired company and adversely impact our financial reporting. If we fail in our integration efforts with respect to any of our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nThe purchase of Inmarsat\u2019s Enterprise Energy business unit brings risks that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nProblems integrating the expanded services and technologies acquired in the Inmarsat\u2019s Enterprise Energy business unit transaction could adversely impact our financial results. These expanded services and technologies include microwave and WiMAX networks in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico serving drillers, producers and energy vessel owners, VSAT interests in Canada, an M2M SCADA VSAT network in the continental U.S. serving the pipeline industry, a worldwide TSI business and a global L-band MSS retail energy business. Integrating these services and technologies may take considerable expense and management time.\nAdditionally, we may have to incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Integrating the accounting and business processes for this transaction may take considerable expense and management time.\nIf we are unsuccessful in the integration of Inmarsat\u2019s Enterprise Energy business unit acquisition and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nFuture adjustments to contingent purchase price related to acquisitions could materially affect our results.\nFrom time to time we acquire companies with a component of the purchase consideration being delayed and the payment thereof contingent on certain performance or other factors (the contingent purchase price). The accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require that we estimate the amount of the contingent purchase price at the time we complete the acquisition. Each subsequent reporting period (until the contingent purchase price is either paid or no longer potentially payable), we are required to re-evaluate the estimated amount of remaining contingent purchase price that is likely to be paid. If the revised estimate of the future contingent purchase price is higher than the amount accrued, then the difference must be accrued and charged to the statement of comprehensive income in that period. If the revised estimate of the future contingent purchase price is lower than the amount accrued, then the accrual is reduced and the difference is credited to income for the period. Because some of these payments would not be deductible for tax purposes, it is possible that the expense (or income) would not be tax-effected on our income statements. These adjustments, if required, could be material to our future results of operations. There were no purchase price contingencies outstanding as of December 31, 2015. As a result of the Orgtec S.A.P.I. de C.V., d.b.a TECNOR (TECNOR) transaction that closed in February 2016 we have certain contingent purchase price arrangements.\nWe may incur substantial due diligence and acquisition costs for acquisitions. If we do not close a transaction, we may not be able to obtain a return on the due diligence and acquisition costs.\nDuring the course of evaluating potential acquisition opportunities we may incur substantial due diligence and acquisition costs related to certain financial analysis, consulting, legal, investment banking and accounting fees. If we do not close a transaction, we may not be able to recoup these due diligence and acquisition costs through the expected return on investment from the potential acquisition opportunity. This may have an adverse impact on financial results.\nIf during our due diligence of an acquisition opportunity we do not discover legal, regulatory, accounting, finance or other adverse matters and close on the acquisition, it may have an adverse impact on financial results and the ability to operate an acquisition as part of a combined entity.\nDuring our due diligence of an acquisition opportunity we attempt to identify legal, regulatory, financial, internal controls or accounting problems that may prevent a successful integration that may include but are not limited to: Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (FCPA) matters, regulatory hurdles, fraudulent legal, internal controls, financial and accounting representations of the business to be purchased, undisclosed side agreements, undisclosed liabilities, potential liabilities, commitments, contingencies, future cash outflows, identity and role of key employees, state of customer relationships, major contractual arrangements and going-concern issues. If we do not discover material adverse legal, regulatory, accounting, finance or other matters and close, it may adversely impact financial results and the ability to operate as a combined entity.\nGrowth in strategic initiatives, emergence into new or adjacent market segments or the addition of strategic acquisitions may result in reduced consolidated financial margins.\nAs we continue to pursue organic growth opportunities in targeted remote communications market adjacencies and expand our competitive market position through strategic acquisitions, financial margins for these new operations may be less than our current operations. The consolidation of these financial margins could result in reduced margins on a consolidated level.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy or continue our operations, and if we are unable to do so, our growth may be impaired.\nNotwithstanding our action in response to reduced oil and gas activity, we plan to pursue a growth strategy in the future. We have made significant investments to grow our business. Additional investments will be required to pursue further growth in the future and to respond to technological innovations and competition. There is no guarantee that we\nwill be able to obtain additional financing or financing on favorable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or at all, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur credit agreement places financial restrictions and operating restrictions on our business, which may limit our flexibility to respond to opportunities and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe restrictions and financial covenants in our credit agreement, and any future financing agreements, could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage, expand or pursue our business activities.\nFor example, our credit agreement restricts our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndispose of property;\n\u2022\nenter into a merger, consolidate or acquire capital in or assets of other entities;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens on property;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\npay cash dividends; and\n\u2022\nenter into sales and lease back transactions.\nThese limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. Our credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios. Our compliance with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures, finance acquisitions, equipment purchases and development expenditures, or withstand a future downturn in our business.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreement may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in our credit agreement, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, and our lenders\u2019 commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, that financing may not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are unable to repay amounts borrowed, the holders of the debt could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding against the collateral. In addition, our obligations under our credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under our credit agreement, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets.\nIf we experience delays and/or defaults in client payments, we could suffer liquidity problems or we could be unable to recover all expenditures.\nBecause of the nature of our contracts, we sometimes commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the client in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they are incurred. In difficult economic times, some of our clients may find it increasingly difficult to pay invoices for our services timely, increasing the risk that our accounts receivable could become uncollectible and ultimately be written off. Delays in client payments may require us to make a working capital investment, which could impact our cash flows and liquidity. If a client fails to pay invoices on a timely basis or defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity.\nChanges in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nearnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets;\n\u2022\nrepatriation of cash; or\n\u2022\nexpiration or non-utilization of net operating losses or credits.\nWe conduct our worldwide operations through various subsidiaries. Tax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Consequently, we are subject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate, including treaties between the United States and other nations. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. A change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, including those in and involving the United States, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher tax expense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings. Repatriation of cash from worldwide operations could increase the tax burden on those funds, lowering the amount of after tax cash available for operations.\nIn addition, tax returns filed are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Outcomes from these continuous examinations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and limitations on the expatriation or conversion of currencies, which may result in significant financial charges, increased costs of operations or decreased demand for our products and services.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, 15.4% of our revenues were earned in non-U.S. currencies, while a significant portion of our capital and operating expenditures and all of our outstanding debt, was priced in U.S. dollars. In addition, we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material effect on our earnings or the value of our assets. Additionally, we may incur foreign exchange risk due to certain intercompany financing and other transactions. In the future, a greater portion of our revenues may be earned in non-U.S. currencies, increasing this risk of fluctuations in exchange rates.\nAny depreciation of local currencies in the countries in which we conduct business may result in increased costs to us for imported equipment and may, at the same time, decrease demand for our products and services in the affected markets. If our operating companies distribute dividends in local currencies in the future, the amount of cash we receive will also be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, some of the countries in which we have operations do or may restrict the expatriation or conversion of currency.\nWe have not implemented any hedging strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. Even if we were to implement hedging strategies, not every exposure can be hedged, and, where hedges are put in place based on expected non-U.S. exchange exposure, they are based on forecasts which may vary or which may later prove to have been inaccurate. Failure to hedge successfully or anticipate currency risks accurately could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our stockholders could exert control over our Company.\nAs of February 20, 2016, funds associated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., or KKR, owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately 27.7% of our outstanding voting power. Additionally, as of February 20, 2016, funds associated with Arrowpoint Asset Management, LLC, owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately 13.8% of our outstanding voting power. As a result, any of these stockholders could potentially have significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval, including election or removal of our directors and change of control transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock.\nWe have entered into a standstill agreement with Digital Oilfield Investments LP, or Digital, an affiliate of KKR, that prevents Digital and any of its affiliates engaged in the private equity business of KKR from taking certain actions through August 26, 2016, including participating in any sale transaction or tender offer that is not approved by our Board or any proposal to seek representation on our Board in excess of one board member or otherwise seeking to control or influence our management, Board or policies. There is no restriction, however, on Digital\u2019s or KKR\u2019s ability to vote against a sale transaction that is approved by our Board.\nUpon expiration of the term of the standstill agreement, there will no longer be restrictions on Digital\u2019s or KKR\u2019s ability to buy additional shares, vote or participate in sale transactions or tender offers or otherwise control or influence our management, Board or policies. As a result, KKR will have the ability to exert influence on our management and operations, and matters requiring approval of its stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of us or our assets.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and in the Delaware General Corporation Law may prevent takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it difficult and expensive for a third-party to pursue a takeover attempt we oppose even if a change in control of our Company would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. In our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences and rights of each series without stockholder approval. The ability to issue preferred stock could discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third-party to gain control of our Company, or otherwise could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This section generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting shares, or with their affiliates, unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner. Our bylaws require that any stockholder proposals or nominations for election to our board of directors must meet specific advance notice requirements and procedures, which make it more difficult for our stockholders to make proposals or director nominations.\nWe have a small market capitalization and lower trading volume compared to most publicly traded companies. If, due to our size, securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of or recommendations regarding our stock, or if one or more of the analysts cease providing research coverage on our stock due to our small market capitalization or low trading volume, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease providing research coverage on our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may not reflect our actual operations and performance.\nMarket and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operations and performance. Stock price volatility and sustained decreases in our share price could subject our stockholders to losses and us to takeover bids or lead to action by NASDAQ. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nquarterly announcements and variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors, either alone or in comparison to analysts\u2019 expectations or prior Company estimates, including announcements of subscriber counts, rates of churn, and operating margins that would result in downward pressure on our stock price; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability or perceived availability of additional capital and market perceptions relating to our access to this capital;\n\u2022\nseasonality or other variations in our subscriber base;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products or technologies;\n\u2022\nour GX commitment;\n\u2022\ndisruption to our operations or those of other companies critical to our network operations;\n\u2022\nmarket speculation or announcements by us regarding the entering into, or termination of, material transactions;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and market new and enhanced technologies, products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts or changes in their estimates concerning us;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of additional debt, dilutive issuances of our stock, short sales or hedging of, and other derivative transactions, in our common stock;\n\u2022\nany significant change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or approvals; and\n\u2022\nperceptions of general market conditions in the technology and communications industries, the U.S. economy and global market conditions.\nAn impairment of goodwill, intangibles, property, plant and equipment could reduce our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our consolidated balance sheet includes $18.1 million in goodwill and $19.0 million of intangible assets. Refer to Note 5 - \u201cGoodwill and Intangibles\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually with additional evaluations being performed when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Similarly, impairment testing is performed on intangibles when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If we were to determine that any of our remaining balance of goodwill or intangibles was impaired, we would record an immediate non-cash charge to earnings with a corresponding reduction in goodwill or intangibles, as applicable, which could reduce our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAs a result of the July 2015 annual impairment test, we recognized $12.6 million in impairment consisting of $10.9 million in impairment of goodwill and $1.7 million in impairment of intangibles, the full amounts within our North America Land reporting unit, which reports through our Western Hemisphere reportable segment. Our North America Land reporting unit has been adversely impacted by a significant decline in U.S. land rig counts since December 2014. This decline has resulted in reduced internal cash flow projections causing the estimated fair value of our North America Land reporting unit to be below its carrying value.\nIn December 2015, we assessed that the fair value of property, plant and equipment was impaired by $1.7 million, as the carrying value exceeded fair value, as a result of further declines in the U.S. land rig counts since July 2015.\nIn 2014, we recognized $2.7 million in impairment of goodwill related to the TSI reporting unit. Such impairment was a result of a significant decline in oil prices and global oil and gas activity for which an impairment test was performed as of December 31, 2014. This circumstance resulted in a reduction in our cash flow projections in the revision of internal forecasts. Specifically the TSI segment was impacted by declining contracted backlog, which reduced the estimated fair value of our TSI reporting unit below its carrying value.\nAny future downturn in our business could adversely impact the key assumptions in our impairment test. While we believe that there appears to be no indication of current or future impairment, historical operating results may not be indicative of future operating results and events and circumstances may occur causing a triggering event in a period as short as three months.", "PERMNO": 12494, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "RNET"}
