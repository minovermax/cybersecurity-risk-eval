{"cik": "702513", "company": "Bank of Commerce Holdings", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following is a discussion of what the Company believes are the material risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company's business, financial condition and future results.\nCredit and Lending Risk\nThe loan portfolio includes purchased loans and loans serviced by other companies.\nPurchased loans included in the loan portfolio totaled $72.6 million or 6% of gross portfolio loans as of December 31, 2020. The loans were purchased under several different contracts as a pool of loans, individual loans or as purchased participations from other institutions. The majority of the loans are located outside our principal market. Additionally, $46.9 million or 4% of our gross portfolio loans are serviced by two unrelated third party servicing companies. A disruption to the operations of either of the loan servicing companies could reduce the value of the assets we own. In addition, if we were forced to service these loans ourselves, we would incur additional monitoring and servicing costs due to the geographic disbursement of the portfolio, which would adversely affect our noninterest expense.\nWe have a concentration risk in real estate related loans.\nA substantial portion of our lending is tied to real estate. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 77% (86% excluding Paycheck Protection Program loans) of our loan portfolio was secured by real estate as follows:\n\u25cf\n45% commercial real estate non-owner occupied,\n\u25cf\n18% commercial real estate owner occupied,\n\u25cf\n5% residential 1-4 family mortgage,\n\u25cf\n3% residential ITIN,\n\u25cf\n2% residential equity lines and\n\u25cf\n4% construction and land development.\nA large percentage of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial real estate loans which generally carry larger loan balances and historically have involved a greater degree of financial and credit risk than residential first mortgage loans. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on cash flows of the borrower (which may be unpredictable) and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Any decline in the economy in general, material increases in interest rates, changes in tax policies, tightening credit or refinancing markets, or a decline in real estate values could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans. Further, our ability to sell or dispose of the underlying real estate collateral would be adversely impacted by any decline in real estate values. This increases the likelihood that we could suffer losses on defaulted loans secured by real estate beyond the amounts provided for in the ALLL, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not record interest income on nonperforming loans or other real estate owned which adversely affects our income. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral, which may result in a loss. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time and increases our loan administration costs. While nonperforming assets are not currently elevated, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future increases in nonperforming assets. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets increases our risk profile and consequently may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate.\nFuture loan and lease losses may exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nWe have established an allowance for possible losses from loans in the credit portfolio. This allowance reflects estimates of the collectability of certain identified loans, as well as an overall risk assessment of gross loans outstanding.\nThe determination of the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is subjective. Although the method for determining the amount of the allowance uses criteria such as risk ratings and historical loss rates, these factors may not be adequate predictors of future loan performance. Accordingly, we cannot offer assurances that these estimates ultimately will prove correct or that the allowance for loan and lease losses will be sufficient to protect against losses that ultimately may occur. If the allowance for loan and lease losses proves to be inadequate, we will need to make additional provisions to the allowance, which are accounted for as charges to income, which would adversely impact results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, federal and state banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our loan portfolio and the adequacy of our allowance. These regulatory authorities may require us to recognize further loan loss provisions or charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from our judgments. Any increase in the allowance could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in how we provide for credit losses may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU introduces a new impairment model based on current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) in substitution for our current \u201cincurred loss\u201d methodology. The CECL model will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans receivable, loan commitments and held-to-maturity debt securities.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nUnder the CECL model, we would recognize an impairment allowance equal to our current estimate of expected credit losses for financial instruments as of the end of the reporting period. Measuring expected credit losses will likely be a significant challenge for all entities, including us. Additionally, in preparing to implement CECL, we have incurred one-time and recurring costs, some of which are related to system changes and data collection.\nFurther, the impairment allowance measured under a CECL model is expected to differ materially from the impairment allowance measured under our existing \u201cincurred loss\u201d model. To initially apply the CECL amendments, for most debt instruments, we would record a cumulative-effect adjustment to our statement of financial condition as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (a modified retrospective approach). Amendments to ASU 2016-13 permit us to delay implementation of CECL until January 1, 2023.\nThe impact of certain provisions of the CECL model regarding loan portfolios of acquired financial institutions could result in earnings volatility, as any adjustments to the ALLL with respect to the acquired loans are required to be made immediately subsequent to the acquisition.\nMore information on this ASU can be found under the heading Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDefaults may negatively impact us.\nRisk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if borrowers, guarantors or related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. We have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies, including the establishment and review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, which management believes are appropriate to minimize credit risk. These policies and procedures, however, may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially affect our results of operations.\nCredit quality for private label mortgage backed securities we hold may deteriorate creating additional credit risk in our investment portfolio.\nOur securities portfolio contains private label mortgage backed securities. These securities have more credit risk than the securities in our portfolio that are obligations of the U.S. Government or obligations guaranteed by the U.S. Government. We monitor the credit characteristics of the underlying mortgages to identify potential credit losses, if any, in the portfolio. If there is a decline in fair value due to credit quality concerns for a security we may be required to recognize an other-than-temporarily-impairment in earnings. Our Investment Policy requires that securities at the time of purchase, be rated A3/A- or higher by Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch rating agencies.\nThe condition of other financial institutions could negatively affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, public perceptions and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients.\nMany of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank is subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans and there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected the property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nLiquidity Risk\nOur deposits are subject to volatility\nOur depositors can always choose to withdraw their deposits from the Bank and place them elsewhere, which could cause an increase in our funding costs and reduce our net interest income. Checking, savings and money market account balances can decrease when customers perceive that alternative investments provide a better risk/return tradeoff.\nAt December 31, 2020, time certificates of deposit in excess of $250,000, represented approximately 4% of our total deposit balances. Because these deposits are not covered by FDIC deposit insurance, they are considered volatile and could be subject to withdrawal. Withdrawal of a material amount of such deposits could adversely affect our liquidity, profitability, business prospects, results of operations and cash flows. We do not hold any brokered deposits. Our 25 largest deposit relationships account for 21% of our deposits.\nConditions in the financial markets may limit our access to additional funding to meet our liquidity needs.\nLiquidity is essential to our business, as we must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. An inability to raise funds through deposits, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (\u201cFHLB\u201d) advances, or the sale of securities, loans, and other assets could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could negatively affect our access to liquidity sources include negative operating results, a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or negative regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. An inability to borrow funds to meet our liquidity needs could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate fluctuations, which we do not control, could harm profitability.\nOur income is highly dependent on \u201cinterest rate spreads\u201d (i.e., the difference between the interest income earned on our interest-earning assets such as loans and securities, and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings). The underlying interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, many of which are beyond our control, including rates paid and charged by our competitors, general economic conditions, inflation, recession and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments and the generation of deposits. These changes affect the rates received on loans and securities and paid on deposits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our loans are fixed rate loans or variable rate loans that are already at their floor rate. This has mitigated the impact of declining interest rates on loan yields during 2020. Our longer-term fixed rate loans and funding mix have caused the Company to become slightly to moderately liability sensitive to rising interest rates; which will remain true until sufficient rate rise allows variable rate loans to move higher off their floors. Our investment portfolio is expected to reprice more rapidly than our liabilities in a decreasing rate environment and cause the Company to be slightly asset sensitive to falling rates.\nWe may be impacted by the retirement of LIBOR as a reference rate.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced that the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may no longer be published after 2021. LIBOR is used extensively in the U.S and globally as a \u201cbenchmark\u201d or \u201creference rate\u201d for various commercial and financial contracts. In response, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), made up of financial and capital market institutions, was convened to address the replacement of LIBOR in the U.S. The ARRC identified a potential successor to LIBOR in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) and crafted a plan to facilitate the transition. However, there are significant conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR. The Financial Stability Oversight Committee has stated that the end or waning use of LIBOR has the potential to significantly disrupt trading in many important types of financial contracts.\nAt this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures or other securities or financial arrangements. The replacement of LIBOR with one or more alternative rates may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings, including the rates we pay on our subordinated debt and trust preferred securities. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under contracts or financial instruments to which we are a party, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nChanges in the fair value of our securities portfolio may reduce our shareholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nWe increase or decrease our shareholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost) of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of related tax, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Generally changes in unrealized gain or loss result from changes in market interest rates. A decline in the fair value of the AFS portfolio will result in a decline in reported shareholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. If these securities are never sold and there are no credit impairments, the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities. In the event there are credit loss related impairments, the credit loss component is recognized in earnings.\nDerivative financial instruments subject the Company to credit and market risk\nWe may use derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in market interest rates in order to limit the impact on earnings and cash flows relating to specific groups of assets and liabilities. Our use of derivatives in our risk management activities could expose the Company to mark-to-market losses if interest rates move in a materially different way than we expected when we entered into the related derivative contracts. In addition, we would be exposed to credit risk should the counterparty fail to perform under the terms of the derivative contracts. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk as well as increased costs. Derivative contracts may contain a provision which allows the counterparty to terminate the derivative contract if we fail to maintain our status as a well/adequately capitalized institution or if specific regulatory events occur. If these contracts were terminated by the counterparty, we would be required to settle our obligations under the agreements, which could also cause operational risk and increased costs.\nOperational Risk\nWe rely heavily on our management team and the loss of key officers may adversely affect operations.\nWe are dependent on the successful recruitment and retention of highly qualified personnel. Our ability to implement our business strategies is closely tied to the strengths of our chief executive officer and other key officers. Additionally, business banking, one of our principal lines of business, is dependent on relationship banking in which our personnel develop professional relationships with small business owners and officers of larger business customers who are responsible for the financial management of the companies they represent. If management team members or other key employees were to leave the Company and become employed by a competing bank, we could potentially lose business customers. In addition, we rely on our customer service staff to effectively serve the needs of our customers. The loss of key employees to competitors or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nInternal control systems could fail to detect certain events.\nWe are subject to many operating risks, including, without limitation, data processing system failures and errors, and customer or employee fraud. There can be no assurance that such an event will not occur, and if such an event is not prevented or detected by our internal controls and does occur, and it is uninsured or is in excess of applicable insurance limits, it could have a significant adverse impact on our reputation in the business community and our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards may impact how we report our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in a restatement of prior period financial statements.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nWe could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm if we fail to properly anticipate and manage risk.\nWe rely on financial models and strategies to forecast losses, project revenue, measure and assess capital requirements for credit, market, operational and strategic risks, and assess and control our operations and financial condition. These models require oversight, ongoing monitoring, and periodic reassessment. Models are subject to inherent limitations due to the use of historical trends and simplifying assumptions, uncertainty regarding economic and financial outcomes, and emerging risks from the use of applications that may rely on artificial intelligence. Our models and strategies may not be adequate due to limited historical data and shocks caused by extreme or unanticipated market changes, especially during severe market downturns or stress events. Regardless of the steps we take to ensure effective controls, governance, monitoring and testing, and implement new risk management tools, we could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm if our models and strategies and other risk management tools fail to properly anticipate and manage current and evolving risks.\nCyber, Third Party and Technology Risk\nConfidential customer information transmitted through the Bank\u2019s online banking service is vulnerable to security breaches and computer viruses which could expose the Bank to litigation and adversely affect its reputation and ability to generate deposits.\nWe provide our customers the ability to bank online. We rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is a critical element of online banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hacking, cyber-attacks, electronic fraudulent activity, attempted theft of financial assets, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security problems. We cannot guarantee that any such failures, interruption or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. While we have certain protective policies and procedures in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses or to modify and enhance our protective measures. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent cyber-attacks, security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to generate deposits.\nOur operations could be interrupted if third party technology service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend to a significant extent, on a number of relationships with third party technology service providers. Specifically, we utilize software and hardware systems for transaction processing, essential web hosting, debit and credit card processing, merchant bankcard processing, internet banking systems and other processing services from third party service providers. If these third party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other qualified service providers, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur future performance will depend on our ability to respond to technological change.\nThe financial services industry is experiencing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. Our future success will depend, to some degree, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as create additional efficiencies in our operations, We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products or service, or be successful in marketing such products and services. Additionally, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may cause services interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with increased dependency on technology.\nOur exposure to operational, technological, and organization risk may adversely affect us.\nSimilar to other financial institutions, we are exposed to many types of operational and technological risk, including reputation, legal and compliance risk. Our ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure while we expand and integrate acquired businesses. Operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, occurrences of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, and exposure to external events. We are dependent on our operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. From time to time, we may need to change or upgrade our technological infrastructure. We may experience disruption, and we may face additional exposure to these risks during the course of making such changes. If we acquire another financial institution or bank branch operations, we would face additional challenges when integrating different operational platforms, causing integration efforts to be more disruptive and /or more costly than anticipated.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nWe face competition from technologies used to support and enable banking and financial services.\nEmerging technologies and advances and the growth of e-commerce have lowered geographic and monetary barriers of other financial institutions, made it easier for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and allowed non-traditional financial service providers and technology companies to compete with traditional financial service companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial solutions and services, including electronic securities trading, marketplace lending, financial data aggregation and payment processing, including real-time payment platforms. Further, clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky, such as cryptocurrencies. Increased competition may negatively affect our earnings by creating pressure to lower prices or credit standards on our products and services requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology and/or reducing our market share, or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk\nWe are subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to modification and change. There are currently proposed laws, rules and regulations that, if adopted, would impact our operations. For more information on these issues, refer to the material set forth above under the heading \"Government Supervision and Regulation.\"\nThe requirements imposed by our regulators and other laws, rules or regulations applicable to us are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties that transact business with us, and are not designed to protect our shareholders. Consequently, these regulations may: (1) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (2) restrict our ability to originate, broker or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (3) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us, or (4) otherwise adversely affect our business or prospects for business. Moreover, banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to address what regulators perceive to be unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of regulatory authority by banking regulators over us may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in order to conduct certain activities, including acquisitions, we are required to obtain regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that any required approvals can be obtained, or obtained without conditions or on a timeframe acceptable to us.\nNo assurance can be given that the Subordinated Notes will continue to qualify as Tier 2 Capital.\nWe believe that our Subordinated Notes meet the requirements of Tier 2 Capital in accordance with the Final Rules and current statutory guidance provided by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board does not provide prior approval for the Subordinated Notes to be classified as Tier 2 Capital however, we did not receive any indication that the Subordinated Notes did not qualify as tier 2 capital during our most recent examination process with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. In the event that the Subordinated Notes do not qualify, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco may require the Holding Company to amend certain terms and conditions of the Subordinated Notes in order for such instruments to qualify as Tier 2 Capital. Under the terms of the Subordinated Notes, the Holding Company also has the option to redeem the Subordinated Notes upon the occurrence of such an event.\nWe cannot give any assurance as to whether the applicable requirements for Tier 2 Capital will change in the future. Even if the Subordinated Notes initially meet the requirements of Tier 2 Capital under the current regulations, if changes are made in the future, and unless the Subordinated Notes are grandfathered into the new regulations, they could become disqualified as Tier 2 Capital.\nStrategic and Other Risk\nFederal Government Monetary Policy could impact our earnings\nOur earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Through its open market operations in U.S. government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings, establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits, and control of the interest rate applicable to excess reserve balances and reverse repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve influences the availability and cost of money and credit and, ultimately, a range of economic variables including employment, output, and the prices of goods and services. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on the Holding Company and the Bank cannot be predicted with certainty.\nChanges in the fair value of our other investments may reduce our shareholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nWe own shares of FHLB stock which are recorded in other assets. The stock is carried at cost and subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. As of December 31, 2020, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our FHLB stock holdings; however, potential negative changes to the financial condition of the FHLB could require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such stock holdings. Any such impairment charge would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nWe own investments in Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (\u201cQZAB\u201d) which are recorded in other assets. The investments are carried at cost and are subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. As of December 31, 2020, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our QZAB investment holdings; however, potential negative changes to the financial condition of the issuing institutions could require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such holdings in the future. Any such impairment charge would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategy could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if we are unable to expand market share in our existing market or identify attractive new markets, locations or opportunities to expand in the future. In addition, our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on whether we can maintain adequate capital levels, maintain cost controls, effectively manage asset quality and successfully integrate any expanded business divisions or acquired businesses into our operations.\nAs we continue to implement our growth strategy by opening new branches or acquiring branches or banks, we expect to incur increased personnel, occupancy, and other operating expenses. In the case of new branches, we must absorb higher expenses while we begin to generate new deposits. In the case of acquired branches, we must absorb higher expenses while we begin deploying the newly assumed deposit liabilities. With either new branches opened or branches acquired, there could be a lag time involved in deploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets. Thus, expansion could depress earnings in the short-term, even if an efficiently executed branching strategy leads to long-term financial benefits.\nCompetition in our market areas may limit future success.\nCommunity banking is a highly competitive business and a consolidating industry. We compete for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, savings and loans, credit unions, finance, insurance and other non-depository companies operating in our market areas. Some of our competitors are not subject to the same regulations and restrictions as are we, and some of our competitors have greater financial resources. If we are unable to effectively compete in our market areas, the Company's business, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe value of goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future\nWe have goodwill and core deposit intangible assets from business acquisitions. A significant decline in the expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock could necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to geographic risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe conduct banking operations principally in northern California. As a result, our business results are dependent in large part upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in northern California. Any future deterioration in economic conditions, particularly within our geographic region, could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u25cf\nLoan delinquencies may increase causing increases in our provision for loan and lease losses and in our Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (\u201cALLL\u201d);\n\u25cf\nFinancial sector regulators may adopt more restrictive practices or interpretations of existing regulations, or adopt new regulations;\n\u25cf\nCollateral for loans made by the Bank, especially real estate related, may decline in value, which in turn could reduce a client\u2019s borrowing power, and reduce the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans held for investment;\n\u25cf\nConsumer confidence levels may decline and cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities and decreased demand for our products and services;\n\u25cf\nDemand for loans and other products and services may decrease;\n\u25cf\nLow cost or non-interest-bearing deposits may decrease; and\n\u25cf\nPerformance of the underlying loans in the private label mortgage backed securities we hold may deteriorate, potentially causing other-than-temporary impairment markdowns to our investment portfolio.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our customers\u2019 future results of operations and/or the market price of our stock.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, as do federal, state and local efforts to address it. Both the direct effects of the pandemic and the resulting United States governmental responses are of an unprecedented scope as it impacts both the health and the economy of our country and the world at large. No one can predict the extent or duration of the pandemic, or its effect on the markets that we serve. Further, the ongoing efforts and impact of the government in mitigating the health and the economic effects of the pandemic cannot currently be predicted, whether on our business or as to the economy as a whole. The pandemic has thus far resulted in significant volatility in international and United States markets, which could adversely affect the market price of our stock. To date, the pandemic has resulted in significant business disruption and volatility in the international and domestic markets, which has led to increased volatility in the market price of our stock and stocks in general.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Company believes it is well positioned to mitigate the potential financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with a strong liquidity and capital position. The Company has implemented several measures to manage through the pandemic, including:\n\u25cf\nlaunched a pandemic team that addresses the daily impact to our business;\n\u25cf\nproactively reaching out to, and working with customers, to assess their needs and provide funding, flexible repayment options or modifications as necessary;\n\u25cf\ndesignated a \u201ccommand center\u201d that supports employees so they can work with customers to provide the PPP loans;\n\u25cf\nincreased monitoring of credit quality and portfolio risk for industries determined to have elevated risk; and\n\u25cf\ndeveloped safety measures for the health of our employees including elimination of unnecessary business travel, social distancing precautions, additional wellness and education programs, and preventative cleaning practices.\nNonetheless, any future deterioration in economic conditions in the markets the Bank serves as a consequence of the pandemic, or a failure of the economy to recover from pandemic related disruptions as quickly as anticipated, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNatural disasters and other uncontrollable events, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunami, wildfires, droughts, floods, mudslides, hurricanes, tornados and other geologic processes could harm our business.\nWe are susceptible to the risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunami, wildfires, droughts, floods, mudslides, hurricanes, tornados and other geologic processes. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our websites, which would prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. California has also historically experienced energy shortages, which, if they recur, could impair our business operation and the value of real estate in the areas affected.\nAlthough we have implemented several back-up systems and protections and maintain business interruption insurance, these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster. The occurrence of natural disasters or energy shortages in California could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nA natural disaster outside California could negatively impact our purchased loan portfolio or our third party loan servicers.\nOur purchased loan portfolio includes a significant amount of loans made to borrowers outside California. We also rely on third party loan servicers located outside of California. Therefore, we are susceptible to the risks of natural disasters outside California. Natural disasters could impact the operations of our loan servicers directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of websites, destruction of facilities, operational, financial and management information systems which could prevent them from servicing our portfolio. Natural disasters outside California could also impact the underlying collateral and borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loans for our purchased loan portfolios.\nNational and global economic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our future results of operations or market price of our stock.\nOur business is impacted by factors such as economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies, inflation, and market volatility, all of which are beyond our control. National and global economies are constantly in flux, as evidenced by recent market volatility resulting from, among other things, a relatively new presidential administration and new tax and economic policies associated therewith, the uncertain future relationship between the European Union and United Kingdom, and the ever-changing landscape of the energy industry. Future economic conditions cannot be predicted, and any renewed deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in our market could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, results, operations and prospects, and could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nShareholders\u2019 Risk\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and the future results, shareholders may also be subject to the following risks:\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThere can be no assurance we will be able to continue paying cash dividends on our common stock at recent levels.\nWe may not be able to continue paying quarterly cash dividends commensurate with recent levels, given that the ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock depends on a variety of factors. The payment of dividends is subject to government regulation in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve Board generally prohibits a bank holding company from declaring or paying a cash dividend which would impose undue pressure on the capital of subsidiary banks or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements that might adversely affect a financial services holding company\u2019s financial position. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System policy is that a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The power of the board of directors of an insured depository institution to declare a cash dividend or other distribution with respect to capital is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions which limit the amount available for such distribution depending upon the earnings, financial condition and cash needs of the institution, as well as general business conditions.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders is dependent on our receipt of cash dividends from our subsidiary Bank. In addition to the restrictions imposed under federal law, banks chartered under California law generally may only pay a cash dividend to the extent such payment does not exceed the lesser of (i) retained earnings of the bank or (ii) the bank\u2019s net income for its last three fiscal years less any distributions to shareholders during such period. The Bank is also prohibited from paying a dividend to the holding company if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of our common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive.\nOur stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u25cf\nActual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u25cf\nRecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nOperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf\nNews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including the failures of other financial institutions;\n\u25cf\nPerceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company and/or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nPublic sentiments toward the financial services and banking industry generally;\n\u25cf\nNew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u25cf\nSignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nChanges in government regulations; and\n\u25cf\nGeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol \u201cBOCH\u201d and historically has been a low trading volume stock. The limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, even if a more active market in our common stock develops, we cannot assure you that such a market will continue.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation could make a third party acquisition of us difficult.\nIn order to approve a merger or similar business combination with the owner of 20% or more of our common stock (an \u201cInterested Shareholder\u201d), our Articles of Incorporation contain provisions that require a supermajority vote of 66.7% of the outstanding shares of the common stock (excluding the shares held by the Interested Shareholder or its affiliates). These provisions further require that the per share consideration to be paid in such a transaction be equal to or exceed the greater of (1) the highest per share price paid by the Interested Shareholder (a) within two years of the transaction proposal announcement date, or (b) the date the Interested Shareholder acquired a 20% -plus ownership interest (if the acquisition occurred less than two years before the transaction announcement) and (2) the fair market value of the Common Stock on (a) the transaction proposal announcement date, or (b) the date the Interested Shareholder acquired a 20% -plus ownership interest (if the acquisition occurred less than two years before the transaction announcement).\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThese provisions could result in the Company becoming a less attractive target for a would-be acquirer. As a consequence, it is possible that shareholders would lose an opportunity to be paid a premium for their shares in an acquisition transaction, even in circumstances where such action is favored by a majority of the Company's shareholders.\nThere may be future sales or other dilutions of our equity which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive our common stock. In addition, we are not prohibited from issuing securities which are senior to our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend in part on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings.\nFuture issuance of shares of our common stock, including those that may be issued in connection with our various stock option and equity compensation plans, in acquisitions or in any other offering of our common stock for cash, could have a dilutive effect on the tangible book value of our common stock, may be dilutive to existing shareholders and could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nThe holders of our trust preferred securities have rights that are senior to those of our holders of common stock and that may impact our ability to pay dividends on our common stock to our common shareholders.\nAt December 31, 2020, our subsidiary Bank of Commerce Holdings Trust II had outstanding $10.3 million of trust preferred securities. These securities are effectively senior to shares of common stock due to the priority of the underlying junior subordinated debentures. As a result, we must make interest payments on our trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock; moreover, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation, all obligations outstanding with respect to our trust preferred securities must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our shareholders. While we have the right to defer interest on the trust preferred securities for a period of up to five years, no dividends may be paid to our common shareholders during that time if any such election has been made.\nOur subordinated debt agreement has provisions that may impact our ability to pay dividends on our common stock to our common shareholders\nOn December 10, 2015, we issued and sold $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed to floating rate Subordinated Notes. The Notes limit the payment of cash dividends to our common shareholders if the Company is not well capitalized or if there is an event of default as described by the note agreement.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES", "PERMNO": 90221, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BOCH"}
