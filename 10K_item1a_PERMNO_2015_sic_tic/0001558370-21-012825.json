{"cik": "1385818", "company": "AYTU BIOPHARMA, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-09-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities includes a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the specific factors discussed below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report ON Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the market price of our securities to decline and could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL POSITION\nWe have a limited operating history, have incurred losses, and can give no assurance of profitability.\nWe are a commercial-stage specialty pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Prior to implementing our commercial strategy in the fourth calendar quarter of 2015, we did not have a focus on profitability. Since then, we have incurred losses in each year since our inception. Our net loss for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $58.3 million and $13.6 million, respectively. We have not demonstrated the ability to be a profit-generating enterprise to date. Even though we expect to have revenue growth in the next several fiscal years, it is uncertain that the revenue growth will be significant enough to offset our expenses and generate a profit in the future. We have a very limited operating history on which investors can evaluate our potential for future success. Potential investors should evaluate us in light of the expenses, delays, uncertainties, and complications typically encountered by early-stage healthcare businesses, many of which will be beyond our control. These risks include the following:\n\u25cf uncertain market acceptance of our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf difficulties in maintaining coverage and reimbursement for our products;\n\u25cf lack of sufficient capital;\n\u25cf U.S. and foreign regulatory approval of our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf unanticipated problems, delays, and expense relating to product development and implementation;\n\u25cf lack of sufficient intellectual property;\n\u25cf the ability to attract and retain qualified employees;\n\u25cf competition; and\n\u25cf technological changes.\nAs a result of our limited operating history and the increasingly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete, our historical financial data is of limited value in anticipating future operating expenses. Our planned expense levels will be based in part on our expectations concerning future operations, which is difficult to forecast accurately based on our limited operating history and our historical strategy of product and/or business acquisition to develop our product and business portfolio. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected budgetary shortfall.\nTo obtain revenues from our products and product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with others, in a range of challenging activities, including expanding markets for our existing products and completing clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining positive results from those clinical trials, achieving marketing approval for those product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling our existing products and those products for which we, or our collaborators, may obtain marketing approval, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government payors. We, and our collaborators, if any, may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, or one of our collaborators does, we may never generate revenues that are sufficient enough for us to achieve profitability.\nWe may need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product expansion and development efforts or other operations.\nWe are expending resources to expand the market for our products and develop our product candidates, none of which might be as successful as we anticipate or at all and all of which might take longer and be more expensive than we anticipate. As of June 30, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $49.9 million. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we raised approximately $40.1 million, net of fees, from a combination of common stock offerings and common stock warrant exercises.\nOur operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we may require additional capital to continue the expansion of commercialization efforts for our pharmaceutical, device and commercial health products, and to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our current product candidates. Raising funds in the current economic environment, as well as our limited operating history, may present additional challenges. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations.\nAny additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to expand any existing product or develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities could dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be unable to expand the market for our pharmaceutical, device and consumer health products, and/or be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs for our current or any future product candidates or expand our operations generally or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will incur increased costs associated with, and our management will need to devote substantial time and effort to, compliance with public company reporting and other requirements.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the rules and regulations of the SEC and any national securities exchange to which we may be subject in the future impose numerous requirements on public companies, including requirements relating to our corporate governance practices, with which we will need to comply. Further, we will continue to be required to, among other things, file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. Our management and other personnel will need to devote substantial time to gaining expertise regarding operations as a public company and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and our efforts and initiatives to comply with those requirements could be expensive.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended June 30, 2021 and concluded that a certain control was not effective. We concluded that we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to our analysis for the accounting of goodwill and other intangible assets and accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets. As a result, we have sought and received technical guidance from a third-party provider. In response, we have taken a number of steps, including incorporating the third-party provider review and expertise in our analysis, and we believe that the issue has been remediated.\nHowever, if in the future we were to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting were not effective, we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or their effect on our operations because there is presently no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy. As a consequence, we may not be able to complete any necessary remediation process in time to meet our deadline for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Also, there can be no assurance that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls in connection with evaluating our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The presence of material weaknesses could result in financial statement errors which, in turn, could require us to restate our operating results.\nIf we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or if our independent auditors are unwilling or unable to provide us, when required, with an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, investors may lose confidence in our operating results, our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. In addition, if we are unable to meet the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to maintain listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nWe may not have cash available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make interest or principal payments on our indebtedness when due.\nAs of closing of the Neos merger, we indirectly assumed $16.6 million of senior secured credit facility with Deerfield, of which $16.0 million was outstanding as of June 30, 2021, and up to $25.0 million of secured revolving loans with Encina. As of June 30, 2021, $7.9 million was outstanding under the secured revolving loan. All obligations under our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our existing property and assets subject to certain exceptions. These debt financings and any future debt financings may create additional financial risk for us, particularly if our business or prevailing financial market conditions are not conducive to paying off or refinancing our outstanding debt obligations at maturity. Since our inception, we have had significant operating losses. As of June 20, 2021, we had accumulated deficit of $178.3 million. Although we have strategies and plans to achieve profitability through revenue growth, we expect to continue to incur net losses and have negative cash flow from operating activities for the foreseeable future as we continue to market our approved products and continue to develop and seek marketing approval for our current and future product candidates.\nAs a result, we may not have sufficient funds, or may be unable to arrange for additional financing, to pay the amounts due on our outstanding indebtedness under our debt agreements. Further, funds from external sources may not be available on economically acceptable terms, if at all. For example, if we raise additional funds through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or technologies, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available when and if needed, our ability to make interest or principal payments on our debt obligations, finance our operations, our research and development efforts and other general corporate activities would be significantly limited and we may be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate one or more of our programs.\nFailure to satisfy our current and future debt obligations under our credit facilities with Deerfield or Encina could result in an event of default and, as a result, our lenders could accelerate all of the amounts due. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under one or both of our debt agreements as a result of an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could seek to enforce their security interests in any collateral securing such indebtedness.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $466.7 million. The available net operating losses, if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2024 and, except for certain indefinite-lived net operating loss carryforwards, will completely expire in 2037. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation, the consolidated income tax return regulations, various corporate ownership changes could limit our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset our income. Because Ampio\u2019s equity ownership interest in our company fell to below 80% in January 2016, we were deconsolidated from Ampio\u2019s consolidated federal income tax group. As a result, certain of our net operating loss carryforwards may not be available to us and we may not be able to use them to offset our U.S. federal taxable income. As a consequence of the deconsolidation, it is possible that certain other tax attributes and benefits resulting from U.S. federal income tax consolidation may no longer be available to us. Our company and Ampio do not have a tax sharing agreement that could mitigate the loss of net operating losses and other tax attributes resulting from the deconsolidation or our incurrence of liability for the taxes of other members of the consolidated group by reason of the joint and several liability of group members. In addition to the deconsolidation risk, an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally a 50% change in equity ownership over a three-year period) under Section 382 of the Code could limit our ability to offset, post-change, our U.S. federal taxable income. Section 382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and certain recognized built-in losses. We believe that the June 2021 transaction with Neos caused an ownership change of Neos, resulting in a limitation in our ability to use their pre-acquisition net operating loss carryovers. We also believe that the same transaction may have caused, together with equity ownership changes in the past 5 years, an ownership change resulting in limitation of our ability to us our pre-acquisition net operating loss carryovers. Either the deconsolidation or the ownership change scenarios could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nThe success of the Company will depend on its ability to obtain, commercialize and grow.\nWe currently have a limited number of products and may not be successful in marketing and commercializing these products. In addition, we may seek to develop current or new product candidates. The testing, manufacturing and marketing of these product candidates would require regulatory approvals, including approval from the FDA and similar bodies in other countries. To the extent that we seek to develop product candidates, our future growth would be negatively affected if we fail to obtain requisite regulatory approvals within the expected time frames, or at all, in the United States and internationally for products in development and approvals for our existing products for additional indications.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMMERCIALIZATION\nWe are heavily dependent on the commercial success of our commercial products. We have generated relatively small revenues from the sales of these products, or any sales revenues from any of our product candidates, if approved, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenues from sales of our prescription and consumer health product portfolios. We have limited commercial experience as a newly combined commercial entity, having only generated revenues from the sale of our sleep product, Zolpimist, since June 2018, from our pediatric products since acquiring that portfolio in November 2019 and from our ADHD products since acquiring that portfolio in March 2021. None of our marketed prescription or consumer health products have thus far generated product sales revenues at levels sufficient for us to attain profitability. We have not generated any revenues from product sales of any other product candidates and, to date, have incurred significant operating losses.\nWe have incurred, and anticipate continuing to incur, significant costs associated with commercialization of our approved products and, if approved, any other product candidates that we may develop. It is possible that we will never attain sufficient product sales revenues to achieve profitability.\nWe have limited experience selling our current products as they were acquired from other companies or were recently approved for sale. As a result, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates.\nDespite our management\u2019s extensive experience in launching and managing commercial-stage healthcare companies, we have limited marketing, sales and distribution experience with our current product portfolio as it is currently comprised. Our ability to achieve profitability depends on attracting and retaining customers for our current products and building brand loyalty for our pharmaceuticals and consumer health product offerings. To successfully perform sales, marketing, distribution and customer support functions, we will face a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain skilled support team, marketing staff and sales force necessary to increase the market for our approved products and to maintain market acceptance for our product candidates;\n\u25cf the ability of our sales and marketing team to identify and penetrate the potential customer base; and\n\u25cf the difficulty of establishing brand recognition and loyalty for our products.\nIn addition, we may seek to enlist one or more third parties to assist with sales, distribution and customer support globally or in certain regions of the world. If we do seek to enter into these arrangements, we may not be successful in attracting desirable sales and distribution partners, or we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. If our sales and marketing efforts, or those of any third-party sales and distribution partners, are not successful, our currently approved products may not achieve increased market acceptance and our product candidates may not gain market acceptance, which would materially impact our business and operations.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We face significant existing competition in the United States and, if approved, would face significant competition in markets outside the United States, from major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Further, makers of branded drugs could also enhance their own formulations in a manner that competes with our enhancements of these drugs.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug products or drug delivery technologies that are more effective or less costly than that of our products or any product candidate that we are currently developing or that we may develop.\nIf our competitors market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our products or that reach the market sooner than our products we may enter the market too late in the cycle and may not achieve commercial success, or we may have to reduce our price, which would impact our ability to generate revenue and obtain profitability. In addition, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because we have limited research and development capabilities, it may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete, less competitive or not economical.\nIf we are unable to differentiate our products or product candidates from branded drugs or existing generic therapies for similar treatments, or if the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products that compete with any of our products or product candidates, our ability to successfully commercialize such products or product candidates would be adversely affected.\nWe expect to compete against branded drugs with distinct clinical attributes and to compete with their generic counterparts that will be sold for a lower price. Although we believe that our Rx Portfolio and product candidates are or will be differentiated from branded drugs and their generic counterparts, if any, including through clinical efficacy or through improved patient compliance and ease of administration, it is possible that such differentiation will not impact our market position. If we are unable to achieve significant differentiation for our products and product candidates against other drugs, the opportunity for our products and, if approved, product candidates to achieve premium pricing and be commercialized successfully would be adversely affected.\nAfter an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) application, is approved, the covered product becomes a \u201clisted drug\u201d that, in turn, can be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. The FDCA, implementing regulations and other applicable laws provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes. These manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use, or labeling as our product candidate and that the generic product is bioequivalent to ours, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as our product candidate. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same quality standards as the listed drugs, would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices.\nThus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product, such as our Rx Portfolio products, can be lost to the generic version. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents to our product candidates would materially adversely impact our revenues, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in our product candidates. For example, on July 25, 2016, Neos received a paragraph IV certification from Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc. (\u201cActavis\u201d) advising them that Actavis filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Adzenys XR-ODT. On October 17, 2017, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and a Licensing Agreement with Actavis, pursuant to which Neos granted Actavis the right to manufacture and market its generic version of Adzenys XR-ODT under the ANDA beginning on September 1, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances. On October 31, 2017, Neos received a paragraph IV certification from Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (\u201cTeva\u201d) advising them that Teva filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Cotempla XR-ODT. On December 21, 2018, Neos entered into a Settlement Agreement and a Licensing Agreement with Teva, pursuant to which we have granted Teva the right to manufacture and market its generic version of Cotempla XR-ODT under the ANDA beginning on July 1, 2026, or earlier under certain circumstances.\nThe design, development, manufacture, supply and distribution of our products and product candidates are highly regulated processes and technically complex.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation in connection with the preparation and manufacture of our products for commercial sale. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMPs and equivalent foreign standards. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including record keeping, and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our products and product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. The development, manufacture, supply and distribution of our approved products as well as any of our future potential product candidates, are highly regulated processes and technically complex. We, along with our third party suppliers, must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA and foreign authorities. For instance, because each of our attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d) products, generic Tussionex, Tuzistra XR and ZolpiMist is a regulated drug product and subject to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) and state-level regulations, we have had to, and will continue to, need to secure state licenses from each state in which we intend to sell such product allowing us to distribute a regulated drug product in such state.\nRegulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time consuming for us to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of our facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us could materially harm our business. If we fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug product or revocation of a pre-existing approval. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nOur consumer health division relies heavily on obtaining products that change from a prescription to over the counter through an FDA approval process. Any delays in this process might impact the financial performance of our consumer health division.\nOur consumer health division actively pursues opportunities where existing prescription drugs have recently, or are expected to, change from a prescription to over-the-counter. Historically the FDA has highly scrutinized any product application submitted to switch a product from physician prescribed prescription to unsupervised over-the-counter use by the general public. The expansion of Rx-to-OTC switches is critical to our future growth. Reluctance of FDA to approve Rx-to-OTC switches in new product categories could impact that growth and could impact the financial performance of our consumer health division.\nOur approved products may not be accepted by physicians, patients, healthcare payors, health technology assessment bodies or the medical community in general.\nEven if the medical community accepts a product as safe and efficacious for its indicated use, physicians may choose to restrict the use of the product if we or any collaborator is unable to demonstrate that, based on experience, clinical data, side-effect profiles and other factors, our product is preferable to any existing medicines or treatments. We cannot predict the degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products, which will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the efficacy and safety of the product;\n\u25cf changes in the standard of care for the targeted indication for any therapeutic candidate;\n\u25cf the approved labeling for the product and any required warnings;\n\u25cf the advantages and disadvantages of the product compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf our and any collaborator\u2019s ability to educate the medical community about the safety and effectiveness of the product;\n\u25cf the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors pertaining to the product;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of adverse events or publicity;\n\u25cf the ability to manufacture our product in sufficient quantities and yields;\n\u25cf potential product liability claims; and\n\u25cf the market price of our product relative to competing treatments.\nIf our future therapeutic candidates fail to gain market access and acceptance, this will have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate revenue to provide a satisfactory, or any, return on our investments. Even if some therapies achieve market access and acceptance, the market may prove not to be large enough to allow us to generate significant revenue.\nOur pharmaceutical, device and consumer health products may prove to be difficult to effectively commercialize as planned.\nVarious commercial, regulatory, and manufacturing factors may impact our ability to maintain or grow revenues from sales of our pharmaceutical, device and consumer health product offerings. Specifically, we may encounter difficulty by virtue of:\n\u25cf our inability to adequately market and increase sales of any of these products;\n\u25cf our inability to secure continuing prescribing of any of these products by current or previous users of the product;\n\u25cf our inability to effectively transfer and scale manufacturing as needed to maintain an adequate commercial supply of these products;\n\u25cf reimbursement and medical policy changes that may adversely affect the pricing, profitability or commercial appeal of pharmaceutical products; and\n\u25cf our inability to effectively identify and align with commercial partners outside the U.S., or the inability of those selected partners to gain the required regulatory, reimbursement, and other approvals needed to enable commercial success of the Healight Platform.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates.\nWe may not be able to develop our current or any future product candidates. Our product candidates will require substantial additional clinical development, testing, and regulatory approval before we are permitted to commence commercialization. The clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the U.S. and in other countries where we intend to test and, if approved, market any product candidate. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through pre-clinical testing and clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in each target indication. This process can take many years and may include post-marketing studies and surveillance, which will require the expenditure of substantial resources. Of the large number of drugs in development in the U.S., only a small percentage successfully completes the FDA regulatory approval process and is commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to continue to fund our development and clinical programs, we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized.\nFor our more strictly regulated pharmaceutical products, such as our Rx Portfolio product offerings, we are not permitted to market a pharmaceutical product in the U.S. until we receive approval of a New Drug Application, or an NDA, for that product from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a complex, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the FDA may delay, limit or deny approval of any product candidate for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u25cf we may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective to the satisfaction of the FDA;\n\u25cf the results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA for marketing approval;\n\u25cf the FDA may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA may require that we conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA may not approve the formulation, labeling or specifications of any product candidate;\n\u25cf the clinical research organizations, or CROs, that we retain to conduct our clinical trials may take actions outside of our control that materially adversely impact our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA may find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials insufficient to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks, such as the risk of drug abuse by patients or the public in general;\n\u25cf the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf if an NDA, if and when submitted, is reviewed by an advisory committee, the FDA may have difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting in a timely manner or the advisory committee may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the FDA require, as a condition of approval,\nadditional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions;\n\u25cf the FDA may require development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval or post-approval;\n\u25cf the FDA may not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract; or\n\u25cf the FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nThese same risks apply to applicable foreign regulatory agencies from which we may seek approval for any of our product candidates.\nAny of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully market any product candidate. Moreover, because a substantial portion of our business is or may be dependent upon our product candidates, any such setback in our pursuit of initial or additional regulatory approval would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nEven if we in the future successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates, those product candidates may not be commercialized successfully for other reasons.\nEven if we successfully complete clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates, those candidates may not be commercialized for other reasons, including:\n\u25cf failure to receive regulatory clearances required to market them as drugs;\n\u25cf being subject to proprietary rights held by others;\n\u25cf being difficult or expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale;\n\u25cf having adverse side effects that make their use less desirable; or\n\u25cf failing to compete effectively with products or treatments commercialized by competitors.\nWe rely on limited sources of supply for our products, and any disruption in the chain of supply may impact production and sales of our products, and cause delays in developing and commercializing our product candidates and currently manufactured and commercialized products.\nMany of our products are produced in single annual production lots by single-source suppliers. Due to the limited production quantities, production of these lots may not be prioritized by the third-party manufacturer, and may not be scheduled and produced at all. If we fail to procure supply of our products, we could lose potential revenue and our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation could be adversely affected.\nOur ADHD products are currently manufactured in our own production facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. We are reliant on a limited number of suppliers for resin, drug compounds, coating and other component substances of our final product candidates and products. If any of these single source suppliers were to breach or terminate its supply agreement, if any, with us or otherwise not supply us, we would need to identify an alternative source for the supply of component substances for our product candidates and products. Identifying an appropriately qualified source of alternative supply for any one or more of the component substances for our product candidates or products could be time consuming, and we may not be able to do so without incurring material delays in the development and commercialization of our approved products or product candidates or a decrease in sales of our approved products, which could harm our financial position and commercial potential for our product candidates and products. Any\nalternative vendor would also need to be qualified through an NDA supplement which could result in further delay, including delays related to additional clinical trials. The FDA, DEA, or other regulatory agencies outside of the United States may also require additional studies if we enter into agreements with new suppliers for the manufacture of our ADHD products that differ from the suppliers used for clinical development of such product candidates.\nThese factors could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our products and product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing them successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of components and APIs on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, including if our suppliers did not receive adequate DEA quotas for the supply of certain scheduled components, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, commercialization of our ADHD products may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue and our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation could be adversely affected.\nManufacturing risks and inefficiencies may adversely affect our ability to produce our products.\nWe expect to engage third parties to manufacture all of our products, at the very least, in the near future. For any future product, we expect to use third-party manufacturers because we will not have our own manufacturing capabilities. In determining the required quantities of any product and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates and our limited experience in marketing our current products, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of product we require. If we do not effectively maintain our supply agreements, we will face difficulty finding replacement suppliers, which could harm sales of those products. If we fail in similar endeavors for future products, we may not be successful in establishing or continuing the commercialization of our products and product candidates.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured these components ourselves, including:\n\u25cf reliance on third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u25cf possible breaches of manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control;\n\u25cf possible regulatory violations or manufacturing problems experienced by our suppliers; and\n\u25cf possible termination or non-renewal of agreements by third parties, based on their own business priorities, at times that are costly or inconvenient for us.\nFurther, if we are unable to secure the needed financing to fund our internal operations, we may not have adequate resources required to effectively and rapidly transition our third-party manufacturing. We may not be able to meet the demand for our products if one or more of any third-party manufacturers is unable to supply us with the necessary components that meet our specifications. It may be difficult to find alternate suppliers for any of our products or product candidates in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us.\nIf we fail to manufacture our ADHD in sufficient quantities and at acceptable quality and pricing levels, or fail to obtain adequate DEA quotas for controlled substances, or to fully comply with cGMP regulations, we may face delays in the commercialization of these products or our product candidates, if approved, or be unable to meet market demand, and may be unable to generate potential revenues.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls, and the use of specialized processing equipment. Pharmaceutical companies often encounter difficulties in manufacturing, particularly in scaling up production of their products. These problems include manufacturing difficulties relating to production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well\nas compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations. If we are unable to demonstrate stability in accordance with commercial requirements, or if our raw material manufacturers were to encounter difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us, our ability to obtain FDA approval and market our products and product candidates would be jeopardized. In addition, any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay or prohibit the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with conducting our clinical trials and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new trials at significant additional expense or to terminate a trial. We purchase raw materials and components from various suppliers in order to manufacture our ADHD products. If we are unable to source the required raw materials from our suppliers, or if we do not obtain DEA quotas or receive inadequate DEA quotas, we may experience delays in manufacturing our ADHD products, and may not be able to meet our customers\u2019 demands for our products.\nIn addition, we must comply with federal, state and foreign regulations, including cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. We may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA and foreign regulatory requirements. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or voluntary recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any of our products or product candidates is compromised due to failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain, or to maintain once obtained, regulatory approval for such products or product candidates or successfully commercialize such products or product candidates, and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay in clinical development, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of our products or product candidates, entail higher costs or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our products or product candidates. Any manufacturing defect or error discovered after products have been produced and distributed could result in even more significant consequences, including costly recall procedures, re-stocking costs, damage to our reputation and potential for product liability claims.\nOur Grand Prairie facility was formerly operated by PharmaFab, Inc., or PharmaFab, the predecessor of Neos. In April 2007, the FDA announced entry of a Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction, or the Consent Decree, against PharmaFab, one of its subsidiaries and two of its officials. The Consent Decree arose out of several perceived cGMP deficiencies related to the manufacture of unapproved drugs or Drug Efficacy Study Implementation drugs that we no longer manufacture. In July 2019, Neos filed a motion with the U.S. District Court of North Texas to vacate the Consent Decree, which was unopposed by the Department of Justice and the FDA and was granted by the court on July 11, 2019. While the Consent Decree has been vacated, there can be no assurance that we will not become subject to similar orders in the future, which may result in us continuing to expend resources and attention to observe its terms, and there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with its requirements.\nIf our sole manufacturing facility becomes damaged or inoperable or we decide to or are required to vacate our facility, our ability to manufacture our ADHD products or our generic Tussionex may be jeopardized. Our inability to continue manufacturing adequate supplies of our products could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\nAll of our ADHD products and our generic Tussionex manufacturing capabilities are currently housed in our sole manufacturing facility located in Grand Prairie, Texas. Our facility and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or manmade disasters, including war, fire, tornado, power loss, communications failure or terrorism, any of which may render it difficult or impossible for us to operate our drug delivery technology platform and manufacture our product candidates or products for some period of time. While we seek to maintain finished goods inventory of our products outside of this facility, it is unlikely that the level of such inventory would be sufficient if we were to sustain anything other than a short-term disruption in our ability to manufacture our products and product candidates at our Grand Prairie, Texas facility. The inability to manufacture our products and product candidates if our facility or our equipment is inoperable, for even a short period of time, may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the future. Furthermore, our facility and the equipment we use to manufacture our products and product candidates could become damaged and time consuming to repair or replace. It would be difficult, time consuming and expensive to rebuild our facility or repair or\nreplace our equipment or to complete the transfer of our proprietary technology to a third party, particularly in light of the requirements for a DEA registered manufacturing and storage facility like ours.\nWe carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with damage or disruption to our business, may not provide coverage in amounts sufficient to cover our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. An inability to continue manufacturing adequate supplies of our ADHD products or our generic Tussionex at our Grand Prairie, Texas facility could result in a disruption in the supply of our products to physicians and pharmacies, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\nThe outsourcing of the manufacturing of our ADHD products to third parties, may negatively impact our business.\nWe plan to outsource the manufacturing of our ADHD products to third-party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of our ADHD products. Manufacturing partner requirements may require us to fund capital improvements, perhaps on behalf of third parties, to support the scale-up of manufacturing and related activities. If our third-party manufacturers are unable to provide commercial quantities of our ADHD products or on acceptable terms, we will have to successfully transfer manufacturing technology to a different manufacturer which may impact our financial performance. Engaging a new manufacturer for our ADHD products will require us to conduct comparative studies or utilize other means to determine bioequivalence of the new and prior manufacturers\u2019 products, which could negatively impact our financial performance. If our third-party manufacturers are unable or unwilling to increase their manufacturing capacity or if we are unable to establish alternative arrangements on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, the revenue that we might receive from our ADHD products may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply. Any inability to manufacture our ADHD products in sufficient quantities when needed could seriously harm our business and our financial results.\nManufacturers of our ADHD products must comply with good manufacturing practice (\"GMP\") requirements enforced by the FDA, NMPA, EMA and other comparable foreign health authorities through facilities inspection programs. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our FDA regulated products may be unable to comply with these GMP requirements and with other FDA, NMPA, EMA, state, and foreign regulatory requirements. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to a manufacturer\u2019s failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our drugs, which would seriously harm our business.\nIf we fail to successfully acquire new products, we may lose market position.\nAcquiring new products is an important factor in our planned sales growth, including products that already have been developed and found market acceptance. If we fail to identify existing or emerging prescription or consumer health markets and trends and to acquire new products, we will not develop a strong revenue source to help pay for our development activities as well as possible acquisitions. This failure would delay implementation of our business plan, which could have a negative adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nIf we do not secure collaborations with strategic partners to test, commercialize and manufacture product candidates, we may not be able to successfully develop products and generate meaningful revenues.\nWe may enter into collaborations with third parties to conduct clinical testing, as well as to commercialize and manufacture our products and product candidates. If we are able to identify and reach an agreement with one or more collaborators, our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. Collaboration agreements typically call for milestone payments that depend on successful demonstration of efficacy and safety, obtaining regulatory approvals, and clinical trial results. Collaboration revenues are not guaranteed, even when efficacy and safety are demonstrated. Further, the economic environment at any given time may result in potential collaborators electing to reduce their external spending, which may prevent us from developing our product candidates.\nEven if we succeed in securing collaborators, the collaborators may fail to develop or effectively commercialize our products or product candidates. Collaborations involving our product candidates pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf collaborators may not have sufficient resources or may decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as budget limitations, lack of human resources, or a change in strategic focus;\n\u25cf collaborators may believe our intellectual property is not valid or is unenforceable or the product candidate infringes on the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25cf collaborators may dispute their responsibility to conduct development and commercialization activities pursuant to the applicable collaboration, including the payment of related costs or the division of any revenues;\n\u25cf collaborators may decide to pursue a competitive product developed outside of the collaboration arrangement;\n\u25cf collaborators may not be able to obtain, or believe they cannot obtain, the necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates in favor of developing or commercializing their own or another party\u2019s product candidate; or\n\u25cf collaborators may decide to terminate or not to renew the collaboration for these or other reasons.\nAs a result, collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all.\nCollaboration agreements are generally terminable without cause on short notice. Once a collaboration agreement is signed, it may not lead to commercialization of a product candidate. We also face competition in seeking out collaborators. If we are unable to secure collaborations that achieve the collaborator\u2019s objectives and meet our expectations, we may be unable to advance our products or product candidates and may not generate meaningful revenues.\nWe or our strategic partners may choose not to continue an existing product or choose not to develop a product candidate at any time during development, which would reduce or eliminate our potential return on investment for that product.\nAt any time and for any reason, we or our strategic partners may decide to discontinue the commercialization or development of a product or product candidate. If we terminate a program in which we have invested significant resources, we will reduce the return, or not receive any return, on our investment and we will have missed the opportunity to have allocated those resources to potentially more productive uses. If one of our strategic partners terminates a program, we will not receive any future milestone payments or royalties relating to that program under our agreement with that party. As an example, we sold Primsol in March 2017, and abandoned Fiera and ProstaScint in June 2018.\nWe may never realize the expected benefits from the divestiture of Natesto.\nThe divestiture of Natesto is part of a strategy to transform ourselves into a high growth, specialty pharmaceutical company. If we are unable to achieve our growth and profitability objectives due to competition, lack of acceptance of our products, failure to generate favorable clinical data or gain regulatory approvals, or other risks as described in this section, or due to other events, we will not be successful in transforming our business and may not see the appropriate market valuation. Moreover, Natesto generated substantial revenue historically which we may not be able to replace. While over time we expect to replace this revenue by investing in, acquiring and accelerating other\nrevenue streams, there is a risk we will be unable to replace the revenue that Natesto generated, or that the cost of such will be higher than expected. In addition, we may not ultimately receive the full benefits from the divestiture over the term as expected. If we are unable to achieve our growth objectives, such failure will be exacerbated by the loss of revenue generated by Natesto, and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development and commercialization goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed, and our business will be harmed.\nWe sometimes estimate for planning purposes the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development objectives. These milestones may include our expectations regarding the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials, the submission of regulatory filings, or commercialization objectives. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones, such as the initiation or completion of an ongoing clinical trial, the initiation of other clinical programs, receipt of marketing approval, or a commercial launch of a product. The achievement of many of these milestones may be outside of our control. All of such milestones are based on a variety of assumptions which may cause the timing of achievement of the milestones to vary considerably from our estimates, including:\n\u25cf our available capital resources or capital constraints we experience;\n\u25cf the rate of progress, costs and results of our clinical trials and research and development activities, including the extent of scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and collaborators, and our ability to identify and enroll patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria;\n\u25cf our receipt of approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies and the timing thereof;\n\u25cf other actions, decisions or rules issued by regulators;\n\u25cf our ability to access sufficient, reliable and affordable supplies of compounds used in the manufacture of our product candidates;\n\u25cf our efforts, or those efforts of our collaborators with respect to the commercialization of our products; and\n\u25cf the securing of, costs related to, and timing issues associated with, product manufacturing as well as sales and marketing activities.\nIf we fail to achieve announced milestones in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and our business, prospects and results of operations may be harmed.\nAny third-party manufacturers we engage are subject to various governmental regulations, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with, and experience delays in, our product commercialization as a result of these regulations.\nThe manufacturing processes and facilities of third-party manufacturers we have engaged for our current approved products are, and any future third-party manufacturer will be, required to comply with the federal Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of devices. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. Any inspection by the FDA could lead to additional compliance requests that could cause delays in our product commercialization. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, or later discovery of previously unknown problems with the manufacturing processes and\nfacilities of third-party manufacturers we engage, including the failure to take satisfactory corrective actions in response to an adverse QSR inspection, can result in, among other things:\n\u25cf administrative or judicially imposed sanctions;\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil penalties;\n\u25cf recall or seizure of the product in question;\n\u25cf total or partial suspension of production or distribution;\n\u25cf the FDA\u2019s refusal to grant pending future clearance or pre-market approval;\n\u25cf withdrawal or suspension of marketing clearances or approvals;\n\u25cf clinical holds;\n\u25cf warning letters;\n\u25cf refusal to permit the export of the product in question; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nAny of these actions, in combination or alone, could prevent us from marketing, distributing or selling our products, and would likely harm our business.\nIn addition, a product defect or regulatory violation could lead to a government-mandated or voluntary recall by us. We believe the FDA would request that we initiate a voluntary recall if a product was defective or presented a risk of injury or gross deception. Regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall drugs or devices because of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could endanger health. Any recall would divert our management attention and financial resources, expose us to product liability or other claims, and harm our reputation with customers.\nWe face substantial competition from companies with considerably more resources and experience than we have, which may result in others discovering, developing, receiving approval for, or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\nWe compete with companies that design, manufacture and market already-existing and new products. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies and/or our competitors improve their current products. One or more of our competitors may offer technology superior to ours and render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. Most of our current competitors, as well as many of our potential competitors, have greater name recognition, more substantial intellectual property portfolios, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources to invest in new technologies, more substantial experience in product marketing and new product development, greater regulatory expertise, more extensive manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers. If we are not able to compete successfully, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to:\n\u25cf expand the market for our approved products, especially our pharmaceutical and devices regulated by the FDA;\n\u25cf successfully commercialize our product candidates alone or with commercial partners;\n\u25cf discover and develop product candidates that are superior to other products in the market;\n\u25cf obtain required regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf attract and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u25cf obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our product candidates.\nEstablished pharmaceutical companies devote significant financial resources to discovering, developing or licensing novel compounds that could make our products and product candidates obsolete. Our competitors may obtain patent protection, receive FDA approval, and commercialize medicines before us. Other companies are or may become engaged in the discovery of compounds that may compete with the product candidates we are developing.\nFor our approved products, we compete with companies that design, manufacture and market treatments that compete with our products.\nWe anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies and our competitors improve their current products. One or more of our competitors may offer technology superior to ours and render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. Most of our current competitors, as well as many of our potential competitors, have greater name recognition, more substantial intellectual property portfolios, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources to invest in new technologies, more substantial experience in new product development, greater regulatory expertise, more extensive manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers. If we are not able to compete successfully, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become profitable.\nAny new product we develop or commercialize that competes with a currently-approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and/or safety in order to address price competition and be commercially successful. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow, and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nGovernment restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenues.\nThe continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect one or more of the following:\n\u25cf our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to set a price we believe is fair for our approved products;\n\u25cf our ability to generate revenue from our approved products and achieve profitability; and\n\u25cf the availability of capital.\nThe 2010 enactments of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Health Care Reconciliation Act, significantly impacted the provision of, and payment for, health care in the U.S. Various provisions of these laws are designed to expand Medicaid eligibility, subsidize insurance premiums, provide incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibit denials of coverage due to pre-existing conditions, establish health insurance exchanges, and provide additional support for medical research. Amendments to the PPACA and/or the Health Care Reconciliation Act, as well as new legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the U.S., could influence the purchase of medicines and medical devices and reduce demand and prices for our products and product candidates, if approved. This could harm our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to market any approved products and generate revenues. As we expect to receive significant revenues from reimbursement of our Rx Portfolio products by commercial third-party payors and government payors, cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of further health care reform could significantly reduce potential revenues from the sale of any of our products and product candidates approved in the future, and could cause an increase in our compliance,\nmanufacturing or other operating expenses. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of prescription drugs and devices is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. We believe that pricing pressures at the federal and state level, as well as internationally, will continue and may increase, which may make it difficult for us to sell any approved product at a price acceptable to us or any of our future collaborators.\nIn addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug or medical device must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. A member state may require that physicians prescribe the generic version of a drug instead of our approved branded product. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products or product candidates. Historically, pharmaceutical products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to have significantly lower prices.\nOur financial results will depend on the acceptance among clinicians, hospitals, third-party payors and the medical community of our products and product candidates.\nOur future success depends on the acceptance by our target customers, third-party payors and the medical community that our products and product candidates are reliable, safe and cost-effective. Many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of our products and product candidates, including:\n\u25cf our ability to convince our potential customers of the advantages and economic value our products and product candidates over existing technologies and products;\n\u25cf the relative convenience and ease of our products and product candidates over existing technologies and products;\n\u25cf the introduction of new technologies and competing products that may make our products and product candidates less attractive for our target customers;\n\u25cf our success in training medical personnel on the proper use of our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf the willingness of third-party payors to reimburse our target customers that adopt our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf the acceptance in the medical community of our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf the extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions.\nIf third-party payors do not reimburse our customers for the products we sell or if reimbursement levels are set too low for us to sell one or more of our products at a profit, our ability to sell those products and our results of operations will be harmed.\nWhile our pharmaceutical products are approved and generating revenues in the U.S., they may not receive, or continue to receive, physician or hospital acceptance, or they may not maintain adequate reimbursement from third party payors. Additionally, even if one of our product candidates is approved and reaches the market, the product may not achieve physician or hospital acceptance, or it may not obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors. In the future, we might possibly sell other product candidates to target customers substantially all of whom receive\nreimbursement for the health care services they provide to their patients from third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, other domestic and foreign government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Reimbursement decisions by particular third-party payors depend upon a number of factors, including each third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u25cf a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u25cf appropriate and medically necessary for the specific indication;\n\u25cf cost effective; and\n\u25cf neither experimental nor investigational.\nThird-party payors may deny reimbursement for covered products if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost-effective diagnosis methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors also may refuse to reimburse for procedures and devices deemed to be experimental.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from each government or third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our potential product to each government or third-party payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. In addition, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be covered and reimbursed in all cases or reimbursed at a rate that allows our potential customers to make a profit or even cover their costs.\nThird-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. Levels of reimbursement may decrease in the future, and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement available for any product or product candidate, which in turn, could negatively impact pricing. If our customers are not adequately reimbursed for our products, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products, which would result in a significant shortfall in achieving revenue expectations and negatively impact our business, prospects and financial condition.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to penetrate foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\nOur future profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize our products and product candidates in foreign markets for which we intend to primarily rely on collaboration with third parties. If we commercialize our products or product candidates in foreign markets, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties;\n\u25cf the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements;\n\u25cf different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n\u25cf import or export licensing requirements;\n\u25cf longer accounts receivable collection times;\n\u25cf longer lead times for shipping;\n\u25cf language barriers for technical training;\n\u25cf reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and related prevalence of generic alternatives to our products;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf our customers\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign markets; and\n\u25cf the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.\nForeign sales of our products or product candidates could also be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs.\nRISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL\nOur pre-commercial product candidates are expected to undergo clinical trials that are time-consuming and expensive, with uncertain timelines and the outcomes of which are unpredictable, and for which there is a high risk of failure. If clinical trials of our product candidates fail to satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy to the FDA and other regulators, we or our collaborators may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of these product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of future therapeutic candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive nonclinical studies, preclinical studies and clinical trials that the applicable therapeutic candidate is both safe and effective for use in each target indication. A therapeutic candidate must demonstrate an adequate risk versus benefit profile in its intended patient population and for its intended use. Most product candidates that begin clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for commercialization. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval.\nPre-clinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and unpredictable processes that can be subject to extensive delays. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. It may take several years to complete the pre-clinical testing and clinical development necessary to commercialize a drug, and delays or failure can occur at any stage. Interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict final results, and success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after promising results in earlier trials and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. An unfavorable outcome in one or more trials would be a major set-back for that product candidate and for us. Due to our limited financial resources, an unfavorable outcome in one or more trials may require us to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more product development programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and financial condition and on the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with clinical testing and trials, we face a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf a product candidate is ineffective, inferior to existing approved medicines, unacceptably toxic, or has unacceptable side effects;\n\u25cf patients may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to the product candidate being tested;\n\u25cf the results may not confirm the positive results of earlier testing or trials; and\n\u25cf the results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate.\nIf we do not successfully complete pre-clinical and clinical development, we will be unable to market and sell products derived from our product candidates and generate revenues. Even if we do successfully complete clinical trials, those results are not necessarily predictive of results of additional trials that may be needed before an NDA may be submitted to the FDA. Although there are a large number of drugs in development in the U.S. and other countries, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA, even fewer are approved for commercialization, and only a small number achieve widespread physician and consumer acceptance following regulatory approval. If our clinical trials are substantially delayed or fail to prove the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates in development, we may not receive regulatory approval of any of these product candidates and our business, prospects and financial condition will be materially harmed.\nDelays, suspensions and terminations in any clinical trial we undertake could result in increased costs to us and delay or prevent our ability to generate revenues.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to design, implement and complete. The completion of trials for any product candidates, which as planned could take years to complete, may be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u25cf demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf validating test methods to support quality testing of the drug substance and drug product;\n\u25cf obtaining sufficient quantities of the drug substance or device parts;\n\u25cf manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate;\n\u25cf obtaining approval of an IND from the FDA;\n\u25cf obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective clinical trial site; and\n\u25cf determining dosing and clinical design and making related adjustments.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in our clinical trials will be critical to our success. Patient enrollment depends on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints and the process for identifying patients;\n\u25cf identifying and enrolling eligible patients, including those willing to discontinue use of their existing medications;\n\u25cf the design of the clinical protocol and the patient eligibility and exclusion criteria for the trial;\n\u25cf safety profile, to date, of the therapeutic candidate under study;\n\u25cf the willingness or availability of patients to participate in our trials, including due to the perceived risks and benefits, stigma or other side effects of use of a controlled substance;\n\u25cf perceived risks and benefits of our approach to treatment of indication;\n\u25cf the proximity of patients to clinical sites;\n\u25cf our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u25cf the availability of competing clinical trials;\n\u25cf the availability of new drugs approved for the indication the clinical trial is investigating;\n\u25cf clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions of the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new therapies that may be approved for the indications we are investigating; and\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain patient informed consents.\nEven once enrolled, we may be unable to retain a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our trials.\nIn addition, any negative results we may report in clinical trials may make it difficult or impossible to recruit and retain patients in other clinical trials of that same therapeutic candidate. Delays in the enrollment for any clinical trial will likely increase our costs, slow down the approval process and delay or potentially jeopardize our ability to commence sales of our future therapeutic candidates and generate revenue. In addition, some of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of any future therapeutic candidates.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed, suspended or terminated due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf lack of effectiveness of product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u25cf adverse events, safety issues or side effects relating to the product candidates or their formulation or design;\n\u25cf inability to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts to continue clinical trials or development programs, which are very expensive;\n\u25cf the need to sequence clinical trials as opposed to conducting them concomitantly in order to conserve resources;\n\u25cf our inability to enter into collaborations relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf failure by us or our collaborators to conduct clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf our inability or the inability of our collaborators to manufacture or obtain from third parties materials sufficient for use in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including mandated changes in the scope or design of clinical trials or requests for supplemental information with respect to clinical trial results;\n\u25cf failure of our collaborators to advance our product candidates through clinical development;\n\u25cf delays in patient enrollment, variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials, and lower-than anticipated retention rates for patients in clinical trials;\n\u25cf difficulty in patient monitoring and data collection due to failure of patients to maintain contact after treatment;\n\u25cf a regional disturbance where we or our collaborative partners are enrolling patients in our clinical trials, such as a pandemic, terrorist activities or war or a natural disaster; and\n\u25cf varying interpretations of our data, and regulatory commitments and requirements by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies.\nMany of these factors may also ultimately lead to denial of an NDA for a product candidate. If we experience delays, suspensions or terminations in a clinical trial, the commercial prospects for the related product candidate will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.\nIn addition, we may encounter delays or product candidate rejections based on new governmental regulations, future legislative or administrative actions, or changes in FDA policy or interpretation during the period of product development. If we obtain required regulatory approvals, such approvals may later be withdrawn. Delays or failures in obtaining regulatory approvals may result in:\n\u25cf varying interpretations of data and commitments by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies; and\n\u25cf diminishment of any competitive advantages that such product candidates may have or attain.\nFurthermore, if we fail to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements at any stage during this regulatory process, we may encounter or be subject to:\n\u25cf diminishment of any competitive advantages that such product candidates may have or attain;\n\u25cf delays or termination in clinical trials or commercialization;\n\u25cf refusal by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies to review pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u25cf product recalls or seizures;\n\u25cf suspension of manufacturing;\n\u25cf withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications; and\n\u25cf fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecutions.\nThe medical device regulatory clearance or approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain, and the failure to obtain and maintain required clearances or approvals could prevent us from broadly commercializing the Healight Platforms for clinical use.\nWe expect the Healight Platform will be subject to 510k (or, potentially 510k De Novo) clearance by the FDA prior to its marketing for commercial use in the U.S., and to regulatory approvals required by certain foreign governmental entities prior to its marketing outside of the U.S.\nIn addition, any changes or modifications to a device that has received regulatory clearance or approval that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or would constitute a major change in its intended use, may require\nthe submission of a new application for 510k clearance, pre-market approval, or foreign regulatory approvals. The 510k clearance and pre-market approval processes, as well as the process of obtaining foreign approvals, can be expensive, time consuming and uncertain. It generally takes from four to twelve months from submission to obtain 510k De Novo clearance, and from one to three years from submission to obtain pre-market approval; however, it may take longer, and 510k, 510k De Novo clearance or pre-market approval may never be obtained. We have limited experience in filing FDA applications for 510k, 510k De Novo clearance and pre-market approval. In addition, we are required to continue to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements even after obtaining clearance or approval. There can be no assurance that we will obtain or maintain any required clearance or approval on a timely basis, or at all. Any failure to obtain or any material delay in obtaining FDA clearance or any failure to maintain compliance with FDA regulatory requirements could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe approval process for pharmaceutical and medical device products outside the U.S. varies among countries and may limit our ability to develop, manufacture and sell our products internationally. Failure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we, and our collaborators, must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and may involve additional testing. We may conduct clinical trials for, and seek regulatory approval to market, our product candidates in countries other than the U.S. Depending on the results of clinical trials and the process for obtaining regulatory approvals in other countries, we may decide to first seek regulatory approvals of a product candidate in countries other than the U.S., or we may simultaneously seek regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries. If we or our collaborators seek marketing approval for a product candidate outside the U.S., we will be subject to the regulatory requirements of health authorities in each country in which we seek approval. With respect to marketing authorizations in Europe, we will be required to submit a European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, which conducts a validation and scientific approval process in evaluating a product for safety and efficacy. The approval procedure varies among regions and countries and may involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval.\nObtaining regulatory approvals from health authorities in countries outside the U.S. is likely to subject us to all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval described above. In addition, marketing approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by the health authorities of any other country, and approval by foreign health authorities does not ensure marketing approval by the FDA.\nEven if we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we or they market our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, this approval may carry conditions that limit the market for the product or put the product at a competitive disadvantage relative to alternative therapies. For instance, a regulatory approval may limit the indicated uses for which we can market a product or the patient population that may utilize the product, or may be required to carry a warning in its labeling and on its packaging. Products with black box warnings are subject to more restrictive advertising regulations than products without such warnings. These restrictions could make it more difficult to market any product candidate effectively. Accordingly, assuming we, or our collaborators, receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we, and our collaborators expect to continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance.\nIf the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our future therapeutic candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the therapy and underlying therapeutic substance will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current good manufacturing practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) and with good clinical practice (\u201cGCP\u201d) for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval, all of which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize such therapies. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with any approved\ntherapeutic candidate, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u25cf restrictions on the labeling, distribution, marketing or manufacturing of our future therapeutic candidates, withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;\n\u25cf untitled and warning letters, or holds on clinical trials;\n\u25cf refusal by the FDA or other foreign regulatory body to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications we filed or suspension or revocation of license approvals;\n\u25cf requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf restrictions on coverage by third-party payors;\n\u25cf fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u25cf product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of the product; and\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition, any regulatory approvals that we receive for our future therapeutic candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the therapy may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of such therapeutic candidates.\nIf there are changes in the application of legislation, regulations or regulatory policies or if we or one of our distributors, licensees or co-marketers fails to comply with regulatory requirements, the regulators could take various actions. These include imposing fines on us, imposing restrictions on the therapeutic or its manufacture and requiring us to recall or remove the therapeutic from the market. The regulators could also suspend or withdraw our marketing authorizations, requiring us to conduct additional clinical trials, change our therapeutic labeling or submit additional applications for marketing authorization. If any of these events occurs, our ability to sell such therapy may be impaired, and we may incur substantial additional expense to comply with regulatory requirements, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny of our products and product candidates for which we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we, and our collaborators, may be subject to substantial penalties if we, or they, fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we, or they, experience unanticipated problems with our products following approval.\nAny of our approved products and product candidates for which we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approval, as well as the manufacturing processes, post approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such products, among other things, are or will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the FDA requirement to implement a REMS to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we, or our collaborators, do not market any of our product candidates for which we, or they, receive marketing approval for only their approved indications, we, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violation of the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations or allegations of violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws.\nWe are subject to various regulations pertaining to the marketing of our approved products.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on the offer of payment or acceptance of kickbacks or other remuneration for the purchase of our products, including inducements to potential patients to request our products and services. Additionally, any product promotion educational activities, support of continuing medical education programs, and other interactions with health-care professionals must be conducted in a manner consistent with the FDA regulations and the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can also carry potential federal False Claims Act liability. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors. These and any new regulations or requirements may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, may adversely impact the marketing of our existing products or delay introduction of our product candidates, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur products and product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nFurther, if a product candidate receives marketing approval and we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by the product after the approval, or if drug abuse is determined to be a significant problem with an approved product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw or limit their approval of the product;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cBlack Box warning\u201d or a contraindication;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way the product is distributed or administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u25cf we may decide to remove the product from the marketplace;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for injury caused to individuals exposed to or taking the product; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing an affected product or product candidates and significantly impact our ability to successfully commercialize or maintain sales of our product or product candidates and generate revenues.\nCertain of our products contain, and future other product candidates may contain, controlled substances, the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation, prescribing and distribution of which are subject to regulation by the DEA.\nCertain of our products, such as, Adzenys XR-ODT, Adzenys ER, Cotempla XR-ODT, Tuzistra XR, ZolpiMist and our generic Tussionex (collectively, our \u201cControlled Substance Products\u201d) which are approved by the FDA, are regulated by the DEA as Schedule II, III or Schedule IV controlled substances. Before any commercialization of any product candidate that contains a controlled substance, the DEA will need to determine the controlled substance schedule, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA. This may be a lengthy process that could delay our marketing of a product candidate and could potentially diminish any regulatory exclusivity periods for which we may be eligible. Our Controlled Substance Products are, and our other product candidates may, if approved, be regulated as \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and the implementing regulations of the DEA, which establish registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA. These requirements are applicable to us, to our third-party manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of our product candidates. For example, Schedule II controlled substances are subject to various restrictions, including, but not limited to, mandatory written prescriptions and the prohibition of refills. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. A number of states and foreign countries also independently regulate these drugs as controlled substances. State-controlled substance laws and regulations may have more extensive requirements than those determined by the DEA and FDA. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may schedule products separately. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the DEA does so, other states require additional state rulemaking or legislative action, which could delay commercialization. Some state and local governments also require manufacturers to operate a drug stewardship program that collects, secures, transports and safely disposes of unwanted drugs. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the U.S. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances are considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances.\nZolpiMist is regulated by the DEA as a Schedule IV controlled substance. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, storing, selling and using of the products are subject to a high degree of regulation. Also, distribution, prescribing and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated.\nAmphetamine, methylphenidate and hydrocodone, which are the active ingredients in our Adzenys XR-ODT, Adzenys ER, Cotempla XR-ODT and generic Tussionex products, are listed by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA. Scheduled controlled substances are subject to DEA regulations relating to supply, procurement, manufacturing, storage, distribution and physician prescription procedures. We currently manufacture these products in our own facilities, which are registered with the DEA.\nRegistered entities are subject to DEA inspection and also must follow specific labeling and packaging requirements, and provide appropriate security measures to control against diversion of controlled substances. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as vaults and inventory reconciliations. Failure to follow these requirements can lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and possibly even lead to a revocation of a DEA registration. The DEA also has a production and procurement quota system that controls and limits the availability and production of\nSchedule I or II controlled substances. If we or any of our suppliers of raw materials that are DEA classified as Schedule I or II controlled substances are unable to receive any quota or a sufficient quota to meet demand for our products, if any, our business would be negatively impacted.\nAnnual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule.\nBecause of their restrictive nature, these laws and regulations could limit commercialization of our product candidates containing controlled substances. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could also result in withdrawal of our DEA registrations, disruption in manufacturing and distribution activities, consent decrees, criminal and civil penalties and state actions, among other consequences.\nThere is a risk we may be unable to sell and distribute certain of our products if we cannot comply with the serialization requirements of the Drug Quality and Security Act within the necessary time frames.\nTitle II of the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 provided increased FDA oversight over the ability to track and monitor the sale and distribution of prescription drugs. Over time, the level within the supply chain for which prescription drugs are to be tracked gets farther and farther down the chain. Currently, we are required to provide product identification information, or serialization, at the manufacturing batch, or lot level. However, going forward the law requires such tracking to done farther down the distribution chain including, (i) wholesaler authentication and verification in November 2019, (ii) pharmacy authentication and verification in 2020, and at the unit level throughout the entire supply chain near the end of 2023. There is no guarantee that we will be able to satisfy each ever-stringent product identification requirements. Failing to do so could result in a delay or inability to sell our products within the United States of America.\nFailure to comply with health and data protection laws and regulations could lead to U.S. federal and state government enforcement actions, including civil or criminal penalties, private litigation, and adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe and any potential collaborators may be subject to U.S. federal and state data protection laws and regulations, such as laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties, including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data, which are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH). To the extent that we act as a business associate to a healthcare provider engaging in electronic transactions, we may also be subject to the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which restricts the use and disclosure of patient-identifiable health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient-identifiable health information, and requires the reporting of certain security breaches to healthcare provider customers with respect to such information. Additionally, many states have enacted similar laws that may impose more stringent requirements on entities like ours. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties if we obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nCompliance with U.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal and administrative penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects, employees and other individuals about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain personal information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may limit our ability to collect, use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our\ncontractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nWe may use hazardous chemicals and biological materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur research and development processes may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological materials. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed any insurance coverage and our total assets. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and specified waste products, as well as the discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and may impair our research and development efforts. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance. In addition, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, and other government agencies could prevent our new products, services and product candidates from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which could adversely affect our business. Any government shutdown or other disruption of normal activities at these regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, could lead to a delay or stop in critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown were to occur, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis, which may result in costs and delays that prevent us from successfully commercializing product candidates.\nWe rely, and will rely in the future, on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract research organizations, contract laboratories, and collaborators to perform data collection and analysis and others to carry out our clinical trials. Our development activities or clinical trials conducted in reliance on third parties may be delayed, suspended, or terminated if:\n\u25cf the third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or fail to meet regulatory obligations or expected deadlines;\n\u25cf we replace a third party; or\n\u25cf the quality or accuracy of the data obtained by third parties is compromised due to their failure to adhere to clinical protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons.\nThird party performance failures may increase our development costs, delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval, and delay or prevent the commercialization of our product candidates. While we believe that there are numerous alternative sources to provide these services, in the event that we seek such alternative sources, we may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without incurring delays or additional costs.\nWe must rely on a third party to develop the Healight Technology.\nWe must rely on Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to conduct testing and clinical trials of the Healight Technology. As a result, we are expected to remain dependent on a third party to conduct ongoing trials and the timing and completion of these trials will be partially controlled by such third party and may result in delays to the Healight development program. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of the trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and our reliance on a third party does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. If we or Cedars-Sinai Medical Center fail to comply with applicable requirements, the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials.\nThere is no guarantee that Cedars-Sinai Medical Center will devote adequate time and resources to the Healight development activities or perform as contractually required. Furthermore, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If Cedars-Sinai Medical Center fails to meet expected deadlines, adhere to our clinical protocols, meet regulatory requirements, or otherwise performs in a substandard manner, or terminates its engagement with us, the timelines for the Healight technology development may be extend, delayed, suspended, or terminated.\nThe development of Healight faces uncertainties related to testing.\nThe development of Healight is based on scientific hypotheses and experimental approaches that may not lead to desired results. It is possible that the timeframe for obtaining proof of principle and other results may be considerably longer than originally anticipated, or may not be possible given time, resource, financial, strategic, and collaborator constraints. Success in one stage of testing is not necessarily an indication that the Healight program will succeed in later stages of testing and development. The discovery of unexpected side effects, inability to increase scale of manufacture, market attractiveness, regulatory hurdles, competition, as well as other factors may make the Healight technology unattractive of unsuitable for human use.\nOur Enzastaurin product candidate is being developed for other indications by other sponsors. Any undesirable adverse events that occur in relation to the activities by other sponsors could delay or prevent our regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of Enzastaurin, or result in significant negative consequences following any regulatory approval.\nUndesirable adverse events that occur in relation to the activities by other sponsors related to our Enzastaurin product candidate could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt development or could result in the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities. Drug-related adverse events involving Enzastaurin by other sponsors could also harm our reputation, business, financial condition and business prospects.\nAdditionally, if Enzastaurin receives regulatory approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such drugs, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf suspending the marketing of the drug;\n\u25cf having regulatory authorities withdraw approvals of the drug;\n\u25cf adding warnings on the label;\n\u25cf conducting post-marketing studies;\n\u25cf being sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients; and\n\u25cf damage to our reputation.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of Enzastaurin, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may seek Orphan Drug Designation or other designations for our product candidates, but even if designated we may not ultimately realize the potential benefits of such designations.\nWe may seek Orphan Drug Designation or other designations for our product candidates from the FDA. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States but where there is no reasonable expectation to recover the costs of developing and marketing a treatment drug in the United States. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and application fee waivers. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. However, Orphan Drug Designation nor any other designation shortens the development time nor regulatory review time of a product candidate nor gives the candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nIn addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a demonstration of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity for the orphan patient population. Exclusive marketing rights in the United States may also be unavailable if we or our collaborators seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan designated indication and may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective. Even if we obtain Orphan Drug Designation, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe are dependent on our relationships and license agreements, and we rely on the intellectual property rights granted to us pursuant to the license agreements.\nA number of our patent and trademark rights are derived from our license agreements with third parties. Pursuant to these license agreements, we have licensed rights to various patents, patent applications, trademarks and trademark applications within and outside of the United States. We may lose our rights to this intellectual property if we breach our obligations under such license agreements, including, without limitation, our financial obligations to the licensors. If we violate or fail to perform any term or covenant of the license agreements, the licensors may terminate the license agreements upon satisfaction of applicable notice requirements and expiration of any applicable cure periods. Additionally, any termination of license agreements, whether by us or the licensors will not relieve us of our obligation to pay any license fees owing at the time of such termination. If we fail to retain our rights under these license agreements, we will not be able to commercialize certain products subject to patent or patent application or trademark or trademark application, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nThe commercial success of our products depends, in large part, on our ability to use patents and trademarks licensed to us by third parties in order to exclude others from competing with our products. The patent position of emerging pharmaceutical companies like us can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical issues. Until our licensed intellectual property is interpreted by a court, either because we have sought to enforce it against a competitor or because a competitor has preemptively challenged it, we will not know the breadth of protection that it will afford us. Our patents and trademarks may not contain claims sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or marketing competing products. Specifically with respect to our licensed patents, third parties may intentionally attempt to design around our patents or design around our patents so as to compete with us without infringing our patents. Moreover, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability, and so our patents may be invalidated or rendered unenforceable if challenged by others.\nWe may renegotiate any of our existing license agreements or other material contracts on terms that might not be viewed by the market as favorable.\nFrom time to time we may renegotiate the terms of our existing licensing agreements. There can be no guarantee that the terms of the renegotiated license agreement or other material contract will be viewed favorably by the market as evidenced by our stock price although the renegotiated terms might be advantageous to our business.\nOur ability to compete may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights or if we are barred by the patent rights of others.\nOur commercial success depends on obtaining and maintaining proprietary rights to our products and product candidates as well as successfully defending these rights against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our products and product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents, or effectively protected trade secrets, cover them. Our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and product candidates is uncertain due to a number of factors, including that:\n\u25cf we may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or issued patents;\n\u25cf we may not have been the first to file patent applications for our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf others may independently develop identical, similar or alternative products, compositions or devices and uses thereof;\n\u25cf our disclosures in patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability;\n\u25cf any or all of our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u25cf we may not seek or obtain patent protection in countries that may eventually provide us a significant business opportunity;\n\u25cf any patents issued to us may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf our compositions, devices and methods may not be patentable;\n\u25cf others may design around our patent claims to produce competitive products which fall outside of the scope of our patents; or\n\u25cf others may identify prior art or other bases which could invalidate our patents.\nEven if we have or obtain patents covering our products and product candidates, we may still be barred from making, using and selling them because of the patent rights of others. Others may have filed, and in the future may file, patent applications covering products that are similar or identical to ours. There are many issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to chemical compounds, therapeutic products, diagnostic devices, personal care products and devices and some of these relate to our products and product candidates. These could materially affect our ability to sell our products and develop our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that our products and product candidates may infringe. These patent applications may have priority over patent applications filed by us.\nObtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. Part of the expense includes periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forgo patent protection or allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer.\nLegal actions to enforce our patent rights can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or other actions against those that have infringed on our patents, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nPharmaceutical and medical device patents and patent applications involve highly complex legal and factual questions, which, if determined adversely to us, could negatively impact our patent position.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and medical device companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The interpretation and breadth of claims allowed in some patents covering pharmaceutical compositions may be uncertain and difficult to determine and are often affected materially by the facts and circumstances that pertain to the patented compositions and the related patent claims. The standards of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, are sometimes uncertain and could change in the future. Consequently, the issuance and scope of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, and U.S. patents may be subject to re-examination proceedings, post-grant review and/or inter partes review in the USPTO. Foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office, which could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review and opposition proceedings may be costly. Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or processes.\nIn addition, changes in or different interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and foreign countries may permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and products and product candidates without providing any compensation to us or may limit the number of patents or claims we can obtain. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection of our products and product candidates, we could lose our competitive advantage and competition we face would increase, reducing any potential revenues and adversely affecting our ability to attain or maintain profitability.\nDevelopments in patent law could have a negative impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Supreme Court, other federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the USPTO may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business.\nIn addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These changes include a transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, changes the way issued patents are challenged, and changes the way patent applications are disputed during the examination process. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have greater resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has developed regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the America Invents Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act, and, in particular, the first-to-file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. Substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act may affect our ability to obtain patents, and if obtained, to enforce or defend them. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the America Invents Act will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend any patents that may issue from our patent applications, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, because we operate in the highly technical field of discovery and development of therapies and medical devices, we rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We expect to enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific and commercial collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us.\nIn addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to pharmaceuticals and medical devices. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of some of our patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-\ncountry basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the U.S. and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. We have or expect to have written agreements with collaborators that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from our collaborations. These agreements provide that we must negotiate certain commercial rights with collaborators with respect to joint inventions or inventions made by our collaborators that arise from the results of the collaboration. In some instances, there may not be adequate written provisions to address clearly the resolution of intellectual property rights that may arise from a collaboration. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from our use of a third-party collaborator\u2019s materials where required, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual property developed with the use of a collaborator\u2019s samples, we may be limited in our ability to capitalize on the market potential of these inventions. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors, or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective, or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property, or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets.\nWe might employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biopharmaceutical or medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nA dispute concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and costly, and an unfavorable outcome could harm our business.\nThere is significant litigation in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. While we are not currently subject to any pending intellectual property litigation, and are not aware of any such threatened litigation, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or product candidates infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If our development and commercialization activities are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses to such patents. A patentee could prevent us from using the patented drugs, compositions or devices. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued to us, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. From time to time, we may hire scientific personnel or consultants formerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities conducted by us. Either we or these individuals may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other similar claims as a result of prior\naffiliations. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win or lose. We may not be able to afford the costs of litigation. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and stock price. Any legal action against us or our collaborators could lead to:\n\u25cf payment of damages, potentially treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent rights;\n\u25cf injunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize, and sell products; or\n\u25cf we or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and business, prospects and financial condition. As a result, we could be prevented from commercializing our products and product candidates.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION, STRUCTURE AND OPERATION\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, including claims under the Securities Act, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near the State of Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive provision shall not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the Exchange Act, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nWe intend to acquire, through mergers, asset purchases or in-licensing, businesses or products, or form strategic alliances, in the future, and we may not realize the intended benefits of such acquisitions or alliances.\nWe intend to acquire, through mergers, asset purchases or in-licensing, additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances and/or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses or assets with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses or assets if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic alliance or acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. We cannot assure you that, following any such acquisition or alliance, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction. These risks apply to our acquisition of ZolpiMist in June 2018 and Tuzistra XR in November 2018, our acquisition of the Pediatric Portfolio in November 2019, the merger with Innovus\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2020, and the merger with Neos Therapeutics, Inc. in March 2021. As an example, we acquired Primsol in October 2015 and Natesto in 2016, but sold those assets in March 2017 and March 2021, respectively. Depending on the success or lack thereof of any of our existing or future acquired products and product candidates, we might seek to out-license, sell or otherwise dispose of any of those products or product candidates, which could adversely impact our operations if the dispositions triggers a loss, accounting charge or other negative impact.\nThe combined company\u2019s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend, in part, upon management\u2019s ability to implement an effective integration of the two companies and its ability to manage a combined business with significantly larger size and scope with the associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the management of the combined company will be successful or that the combined company will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Neos merger, which could adversely affect the value of shares of our common stock.\nThe success of the Neos merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks, including, among others:\n\u25cf our ability to successfully combine the businesses of Aytu and Neos;\n\u25cf the risk that the combined businesses will not perform as expected;\n\u25cf the extent to which Aytu will be able to realize the expected synergies, which include potential savings from re-assessing priority assets and aligning investments, eliminating duplication and redundancy, adopting an optimized operating model between both companies and leveraging scale, and value creation resulting from the combination of the businesses of Aytu and Neos;\n\u25cf the possibility that Aytu paid more for Neos than the value it will derive from the merger;\n\u25cf the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Neos;\n\u25cf the possibility that significant unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of coordinating the merged businesses; and\n\u25cf the possibility of costly litigation challenging the merger.\nIf we is not able to successfully combine the businesses of Aytu and Neos within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected and the value of the shares of Aytu common stock may be adversely affected.\nAytu and Neos have operated independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Aytu or Neos employees, the disruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of Neos and Aytu in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger so the combined business performs as expected include, among others:\n\u25cf integrating the companies\u2019 technologies, products and services;\n\u25cf identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;\n\u25cf harmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development, compensation and benefit programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;\n\u25cf addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u25cf maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n\u25cf attracting and recruiting prospective employees;\n\u25cf consolidating the companies\u2019 corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure;\n\u25cf managing the movement of certain businesses and positions to different locations;\n\u25cf coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and\n\u25cf effecting potential actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.\nIn addition, at times, the attention of certain members of each company\u2019s management and each company\u2019s resources may be focused on the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company\u2019s ongoing business and the business of the combined company.\nFollowing the merger, a significant amount of the combined company\u2019s total assets will be related to acquired intangible assets and goodwill, which are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Because of the significance of these assets, any charges for impairment as well as amortization of intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIn fiscal 2021, the great majority of our gross revenue and gross accounts receivable were due to three significant customers, the loss of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThree customers contributed greater than 10% of our gross revenue during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, three customers accounted for 54% and 46% of gross revenue, respectively. The loss of one or more of our significant partners or collaborators could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. As of June 30, 2021, three customers accounted for 85% of gross accounts receivable. As of June 30, 2020, four customers accounted for 60% of gross accounts receivable.\nWe will need to develop and expand our company, and we may encounter difficulties in managing this development and expansion, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had 175 full-time employees, and in connection with the expansion of our commercial product portfolio and our internal drug candidate development programs, we expect to continue to increase our number of employees and the scope of our operations. To manage our anticipated development and expansion, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. This may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the planned expanded commercialization of our approved products and the development of\nour product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to expand the market for our approved products and develop our product candidates, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of our company.\nWe depend on key personnel and attracting qualified management personnel and our business could be harmed if we lose personnel and cannot attract new personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the technical and management skills of our directors, officers and key personnel. Any of our directors could resign from our board at any time and for any reason. Although our executive officers Joshua Disbrow and Richard Eisenstadt have employment agreements, the existence of an employment agreement does not guarantee the retention of the executive officer for any period of time, and each agreement obligates us to pay the officer lump sum severance of two years and one year, respectively, of salary if we terminate him without cause, as defined in the agreement, which could hurt our liquidity. The loss of the services of either of these individuals would likely have a material adverse effect on us. Our success also will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management, marketing, technical, and sales executives and personnel. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key personnel. The loss of any of our directors or key executives, or the failure to attract, integrate, motivate, and retain additional key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe compete for such personnel, including directors, against numerous companies, including larger, more established companies with significantly greater financial resources than we possess. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProduct liability and other lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our product candidates.\nWe will be exposed to potential product liability and professional indemnity risks that are inherent in the research, development, manufacturing, marketing and use of therapeutic candidates. Any failure of future therapeutic candidates by us and our corporate collaborators in clinical trials may expose us to liability claims as may the potential sale of any therapies approved in the future. These claims might be made by patients who use our therapies, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, our corporate collaborators or other third parties that research or sell our therapies. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could be difficult and costly to defend and could materially adversely affect the market for our future therapeutic candidates or any prospects for commercialization of our future therapeutic candidates. Although the clinical trial process is designed to identify and assess potential side effects, it is always possible that a drug, even after regulatory approval, may exhibit unforeseen side effects. If any of our future therapeutic candidates causes adverse side effects during clinical trials or after regulatory approval, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities.\nThe risk that we may be sued on product liability claims is inherent in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical, medical device and personal care products and devices. Side effects of, or manufacturing defects in, products that we develop and commercialized could result in the deterioration of a patient\u2019s condition, injury or even death. Once a product is approved for sale and commercialized, the likelihood of product liability lawsuits increases. Claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief for themselves or by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. These lawsuits may divert our management from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend. In addition, if we are held liable in any of these lawsuits, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be forced to limit or forgo further commercialization of the affected products.\nWe may be subject to legal or administrative proceedings and litigation other than product liability lawsuits which may be costly to defend and could materially harm our business, financial condition and operations.\nAlthough we maintain general liability, clinical trial liability and product liability insurance, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities. In addition, insurance coverage is increasingly expensive and difficult to obtain. For example, we have experienced increasing difficulty in procuring insurance coverage for our products, in particular, our opioid based products, due to their status as controlled substances. Inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product or other legal or administrative liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercial production and sale of any of our products and product candidates that receive regulatory approval, which could adversely affect our business. Product liability claims could also harm our reputation, which may adversely affect our collaborators\u2019 ability to commercialize our products successfully. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nPublic concern over the abuse of medications that are controlled substances, including increased legislative, legal and regulatory action, could negatively affect our business.\nProducts containing controlled substances may generate public controversy. Certain governmental and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local jurisdictions, are focused on the abuse of controlled substances such as opioids in the United States. State and local governmental agencies have commenced investigations into pharmaceutical companies and others in the supply chain in connection with the distribution of opioid medications. For example, on March 7, 2018 and April 18, 2019, we received citations advising us that the County of Harris Texas and the County of Walker Texas filed lawsuits on December 13, 2017 and January 11, 2019, respectively, against us and various other alleged manufacturers, promoters, sellers and distributors of opioid pharmaceutical products. Through these lawsuits, each of Harris County and Walker County seek to recoup as damages some of the expenses they allegedly have incurred to combat opioid use and addiction. Each of Harris County and Walker County also seeks punitive damages, disgorgement of profits and attorneys\u2019 fees. In addition, multiple lawsuits have been filed against pharmaceutical companies alleging, among other claims, failures to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances, negligence by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances, and failures to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations. Certain of these cases have recently been settled, some for hundreds of millions of dollars. In the future, political pressures and adverse publicity could lead to delays in, and increased expenses for, and limit or restrict, the introduction and marketing of our product or product candidates, the withdrawal of currently approved products from the market, or result in other legal action.\nIn addition, we are aware of other legislative, regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications which could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict. For example, the State of New York has undertaken efforts to create an annual surcharge on all manufacturers and distributors licensed to sell or distribute opioids in New York, as well as a tax on sales of opioids in the state. Other states have implemented and are also considering legislation that could require us to pay taxes, licensing fees, or assessments on the distribution of opioid medications in those states. These laws and proposed bills vary in the amounts and the means of calculation. Liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws will likely have an adverse impact on our results of operations, unless we are able to mitigate them through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted and may result in us ceasing to continue to sell our products in these jurisdictions.\nRISK RELATED TO SECURITIES MARKETS AND INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, the exchange may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting notification, we anticipate that we would take actions to restore our compliance with applicable exchange requirements, such as stabilize our market price, improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below such\nexchange\u2019s minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with such exchange\u2019s listing requirements.\nFuture sales and issuances of our equity securities or rights to purchase our equity securities, including pursuant to equity incentive plans, would result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may, as we have in the past, sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be further diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders.\nPursuant to our Aytu 2015 Stock Plan, our Board of Directors is currently authorized to award up to a total of 5.0 million shares of common stock or options to purchase shares of common stock to our officers, directors, employees and non-employee consultants. Stockholders will experience dilution in the event that additional shares of common stock are issued under our Aytu 2015 Stock Plan, or options issued under our Aytu 2015 Stock Plan are exercised, or any warrants are exercised for shares of our common stock.\nOur share price is volatile and may be influenced by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this prospectus, these factors include:\n\u25cf the products or product candidates we acquire for commercialization;\n\u25cf the products and product candidates we seek to pursue, and our ability to obtain rights to develop, commercialize and market those product candidates;\n\u25cf our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated adverse results or delays in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf our failure to expand the market for our currently approved products or commercialize our product candidates, if approved;\n\u25cf unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of any of our product candidates;\n\u25cf overall performance of the equity markets and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in the healthcare, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u25cf introduction of new products offered by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and manage such growth;\n\u25cf issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, or the perception that such sales could occur;\n\u25cf trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u25cf general political and economic conditions;\n\u25cf effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events;\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control;\n\u25cf adverse regulatory decisions;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u25cf changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates, including without limitation clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u25cf disputes or other developments relating to patents and other proprietary rights and our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates;\n\u25cf our dependence on third parties, including CROs and scientific and medical advisors;\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed any financial guidance or expectations regarding development milestones that we may provide to the public;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; and\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the stocks of small-cap healthcare, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and any trading volume could decline.\nAny trading market for our common stock that may develop will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We have a limited number of securities and industry analysts who publish research on us or our business and additional securities and industry analysts may never publish research on us or our business. If we do not broaden the coverage of our company from securities or industry analysts, the trading price for our stock could be negatively affected. If securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, and one or more of those analysts downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and any trading volume to decline.\nOur reverse stock split of 1-for-10 effected on December 8, 2020 may not achieve one or more of our objectives.\nHistorically, we have affected four reverse stock splits since June 8, 2015, each of which has impacted the trading liquidity of the shares of our common stock. There can be no assurance that the market price per share of our common stock after a reverse stock split will remain unchanged or increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. The market price of our shares may fluctuate and potentially decline after a reverse stock split. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our common stock after a reverse stock split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split. Moreover, the market price of our common stock following a reverse stock split may not exceed or remain higher than the market price prior to the reverse stock split.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that a reverse stock split will result in a per-share market price that will attract institutional investors or investment funds or that such share price will satisfy investing guidelines of institutional investors or investment funds. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve. Further, if a reverse stock split is effected and the market price of our common stock declines, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plan or otherwise, could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe could need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors in a prior transaction may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Additionally, any such sales may result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Further, any future sales of our common stock by us or resales of our common stock by our existing stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Any future grants of options, warrants or other securities exercisable or convertible into our common stock, or the exercise or conversion of such shares, and any sales of such shares in the market, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and applicable Delaware law may discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if the acquisition may be beneficial to some of our stockholders.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as certain provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so may benefit some of our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u25cf the authorization of 50.0 million shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the rights, preferences and privileges of which may be established and shares of which may be issued by our Board of Directors at its discretion from time to time and without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u25cf allowing for the creation of a staggered board of directors;\n\u25cf eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by the board of directors. This provision could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders.\nAny provision of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or of Delaware law that is applicable to us that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock in the event that a potentially beneficial acquisition is discouraged, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nThe elimination of personal liability against our directors and officers under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights held by our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenses.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws eliminate the personal liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent permissible under Delaware law. Further, our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws and individual indemnification agreements we have entered with each of our directors and executive officers provide that we are obligated to indemnify each of our directors or officers to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware law and, subject to certain conditions, advance the expenses incurred by any director or officer in defending any action, suit or proceeding prior to its final disposition. Those indemnification obligations could expose us to substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against our directors or officers, which we may be unable to afford. Further, those provisions and resulting costs may discourage us or our stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against any of our current or former directors or officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, even if such actions might otherwise benefit our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends in the future would depend on our financial condition, contractual restrictions, solvency tests imposed by applicable corporate laws, results of operations, anticipated cash requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our stockholders should not expect that we will ever pay cash or other dividends on our outstanding capital stock.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOur business may be adversely affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business could be adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where we have business activities and could cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers (\u201cCMOs\u201d and contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) upon whom we rely. For example, beginning in late 2019, the outbreak of a novel strain of virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), or coronavirus, which causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, has evolved into a global pandemic. The coronavirus has spread to most regions of the world.\nAs a result of the coronavirus pandemic, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business and clinical trials, including:\n\u25cf We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on demand for our products due to government-imposed quarantines, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, mandated business closings and other public health safety measures which may result in patients not visiting their healthcare providers or their pharmacies to get their prescriptions filled. Initially, we suspended in-person\ninteractions by our sales and marketing personnel in healthcare settings. We engaged with these customers remotely, via webinar programs and virtual meetings, as we sought to continue to support healthcare professionals and patient care. As parts of the country reopened, our sales and marketing personnel reengaged with healthcare professionals, sometimes in limited number of in-person interactions. Remote interactions may be less effective than in-person interactions.\n\u25cf We currently rely on third-party suppliers and CMOs as well as to perform third-party logistics functions. If any such third party in our supply chain for materials is adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including staffing shortages, production shutdowns and disruptions in delivery systems, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture commercial quantities of our products.\n\u25cf In March 2020, we closed our offices and manufacturing facilities, and requested that most of our personnel, including our administrative employees, work remotely, restricted on-site staff to only those personnel who must perform essential activities that must be completed on-site and limited the number of staff in any given location. We reopened our manufacturing in mid-June and our offices reponed on a voluntary basis for those personnel who prefer to work from the office. Our increased reliance on personnel working remotely may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact our business.\n\u25cf We may in the future conduct clinical trials for product candidates in geographies which are affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Potential impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on our potential clinical trials may include disruptions or delays in site initiations, patient enrollment and recruitment, standard study monitoring practices, shipment of samples and availability of clinical trial materials, data analysis and reporting of results due to changes in policies at various clinical sites or in federal, state, local or foreign laws, rules and regulations. Other impacts could include quarantines or other travel restrictions. Interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA could also impair our ability to discuss clinical programs. It is unknown how long these pauses or disruptions could continue.\n\u25cf Health regulatory agencies globally may experience disruptions in their operations as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies may have slower response times or be under-resourced to continue to monitor our clinical trials and, as a result, review, inspection, and other timelines may be materially delayed. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur.\n\u25cf The trading prices for our common shares and other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, we may face difficulties raising further capital through sales of our common shares or convertible debt or such sales may be on unfavorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of the coronavirus could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common shares.\nThe coronavirus pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The ultimate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business operations is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, which cannot be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, additional or modified government actions, new information that will emerge concerning the severity and impact of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain coronavirus or address its impact in the short and long term. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impact on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or security breaches.\nWe utilize information technology, or IT, systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information in connection with our business activities. As use of digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, have increased in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the\nconfidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing cyber attacks or successfully mitigating their effects.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from such cyber attacks, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, ransomware attacks, phishing expeditions, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such an event could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss of data from completed clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could suffer reputational harm or face litigation or adverse regulatory action and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the health care system in the United States may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results. In particular, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d or \u201cACA\u201d), was signed into law. This legislation changes the current system of healthcare insurance and benefits intended to broaden coverage and control costs. The law also contains provisions that will affect companies in the pharmaceutical industry and other healthcare related industries by imposing additional costs and changes to business practices. Provisions affecting pharmaceutical companies include the following:\n\u25cf mandatory rebates for drugs sold into the Medicaid program have been increased, and the rebate requirement has been extended to drugs used in risk based Medicaid managed care plans.\n\u25cf the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Service Act has been extended to require mandatory discounts for drug products sold to certain critical access hospitals, cancer hospitals and other covered entities.\n\u25cf pharmaceutical companies are required to offer discounts on branded drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, commonly referred to as the \u201cDonut Hole.\"\n\u25cf pharmaceutical companies are required to pay an annual non tax deductible fee to the federal government based on each company\u2019s market share of prior year total sales of branded drugs to certain federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense.\nDespite initiatives to invalidate the ACA, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld certain key aspects of the legislation, including a tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d However, as a result of tax reform legislation passed in December 2017, the individual mandate was eliminated effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Trump administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling would have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018, the same judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. Pending review, it is unclear what effect the latest ruling will have on the status of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. We will continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business.\nIn addition, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance\nmandated by the ACA. Further, the Trump administration has concluded that cost sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies required under the ACA have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it would discontinue these payments immediately until such appropriations are made. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017 and again on July 18, 2018. Furthermore, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third party payors who argued were owed to them. On December 10, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in Moda Health Plan, Inc. v. United States, which will determine whether the government must make risk corridor payments. On April 27, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that ACA requires the federal government to compensate insurers for significant losses their health plans incurred during the first three years of the Act\u2019s marketplaces, and that insurers can sue for nonpayment in the Court of Federal Claims. The effects of a potential future gap in reimbursement on third party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. In December 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of the federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment.\nMoreover, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices; however, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repeals the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.\nIn 2021, Congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA, and litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. Changes to the ACA or other existing health care regulations could significantly impact our business and the pharmaceutical industry. Although it is too early to determine the effect of legal challenges, pending legislation, and executive action on the ACA, the law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nAdditionally, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:\n\u25cf the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken.\n\u25cf the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nThe Right to Try Act of 2018 provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer should develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.\nFurther, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid health care costs. Individual states in the United States have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nAt the federal level, the Trump Administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2020 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump Administration released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. Additionally, in December 2019, the FDA issued a draft guidance document outlining a potential pathway for manufacturers to obtain an additional National Drug Code, or NDC, for an FDA-approved drug that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and that was authorized for sale in that foreign country. The regulatory and market implications of the draft guidance, if finalized, is unknown at this time. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability. Further, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on September 25, 2019, the Senate Finance Committee introduced the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, a bill intended to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug prices. The proposed legislation would restructure the Part D benefit, modify payment methodologies for certain drugs, and impose an inflation cap on drug price increases. An even more restrictive bill, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 19, 2019, and would require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. The Lower Drugs Costs Now Act of 2019 has passed out of the House and was delivered to the Senate on December 16, 2019. However, it is unclear whether either of these bills will make it through both chambers and be signed into law, and if either is enacted, what effect it would have on our business. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, have been designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We anticipate pricing scrutiny will continue and escalate, including on a global basis. As a result, our business and reputation may be harmed, our stock price may be adversely impacted and experience periods of volatility, and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nCMS may also develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. CMS finalized regulations that give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Additionally, CMS finalized a rule that amends the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. In May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS\u2019s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. CMS is still considering proposed changes to the definition of \u201cnegotiated prices\u201d in the regulations. It is unclear what effect such changes will have on our business and ability to receive adequate reimbursement for our products.\nIn addition, in September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with REMS approved by the FDA. The FDA\u2019s exercise of this authority could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased\ncosts to ensure compliance with post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of approved products.\nMoreover, we cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal and state legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives in the United States to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.", "PERMNO": 16974, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AYTU"}
