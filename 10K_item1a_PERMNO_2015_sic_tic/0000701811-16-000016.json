{"cik": "701811", "company": "MENTOR GRAPHICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe forward-looking statements contained under \u201cOutlook for Fiscal Year 2017\u201d in Part II, Item 7., \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and all other statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact including without limitation statements containing the words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cprojections,\u201d and words of similar meaning, constitute forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Moreover, from time to time, we may issue other forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements regarding financial performance in future periods, including the statements under \u201cOutlook for Fiscal Year 2017\u201d, do not reflect potential impacts of mergers or acquisitions or other significant transactions or events that have not been announced as of the time the statements are made. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect future events or revised expectations. Our business faces many risks, and set forth below are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these factors.\nWeakness in the United States and international economies may harm our business.\nOur revenue levels are generally dependent on the level of technology capital spending, which includes worldwide expenditures for electronic design automation (EDA) software, hardware, and consulting services. Periods of economic uncertainty arising out of concerns such as weakness in the European Union relating to debt issues or political instability, slowing growth in China, and the continuing weakness of the Japanese economy can adversely affect our customers. In addition, an unusual consolidation is occurring in the semiconductor industry worldwide. As a result, customers may postpone decisions to license or purchase our products, reduce their spending, or be less able or willing to make payment obligations, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, significant customer payment defaults or bankruptcies could materially harm our business.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries.\nPurchases of our products and services are highly dependent upon new design projects initiated by customers in the integrated circuit (IC) and electronics systems industries. These industries are highly cyclical and are subject to constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The increasing complexity of ICs and resulting increase in costs to design and manufacture ICs have in recent years led to fewer design starts, which could reduce demand for our products. In addition, the IC and electronics systems industries regularly experience significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles within such companies or a decline in general economic conditions. These downturns could cause diminished demand for our products and services.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of merger and acquisition activity by our customers.\nLike many industries, the semiconductor and electronics industries are subject to mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, and our customers or parts of their business may acquire or be acquired by other customers. Merger and acquisition activity in the semiconductor industry was unusually strong during 2015. This activity appears to be the result of semiconductor companies, experiencing slower sales in their existing market segments, desiring to broaden the scope of their businesses and to spread the rising costs of product development and use of advanced technologies across a larger organization. Increasing consolidation could result in fewer customers in these industries or the loss of some customers to competitors, or reduced customer spending on software and services due to redundancies or stronger customer negotiating power, which could have an adverse effect on our business and future revenues.\nOur forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate.\nOur revenues, particularly new hardware and software license revenues, are difficult to forecast. We use a \u201cpipeline\u201d system, a common industry practice, to forecast revenues and trends in our business. Sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision, the dollar amount of the sale, and the products or services to be sold. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time, in part because the \u201cconversion rate\u201d of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate and requires management judgment. A variation in the conversion rate could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and materially adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in customer spending or weak economic conditions generally can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount, or canceled. The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to postpone negotiating the terms of a transaction until the end of a fiscal quarter\nanticipating they will obtain more favorable terms. This may result in failure to agree to terms within the fiscal quarter and cause expected revenue to slip into a subsequent quarter.\nOur business could be impacted by fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to customer seasonal purchasing patterns, the timing of significant orders, and the mix of licenses, products, and services purchased by our customers.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, varied quarterly operating results. Various factors affect our quarterly operating results and some of these are not within our control, including customer demand and the timing of significant orders. We typically experience seasonality in demand for our products due to the purchasing cycles of our customers, with revenues in the fourth quarter generally being the highest. If planned contract renewals are delayed or the average size of renewed contracts is smaller than we anticipate, we could fail to meet our own and investors\u2019 expectations, which could have a material adverse impact on our stock price.\nOur revenues are also affected by the mix of transaction types in which we recognize revenues in different ways as required by accounting rules: as payments become due and payable, on a cash basis, ratably over the license term, or at the beginning of the license term. A shift in the license mix toward increased ratable, due and payable, and/or cash-based revenue recognition could result in increased deferral of revenues to future periods and would decrease current revenues, which could result in us not meeting near-term revenue expectations.\nThe gross margin on our software is greater than that for our emulation hardware systems, software support, and professional services. Therefore, our gross margin may vary as a result of the mix of products and services sold. We also have a significant amount of fixed or relatively fixed costs, such as employee costs and purchased technology amortization, and costs which are committed in advance and can only be adjusted periodically. As a result, a small failure to reach planned revenues would likely have a relatively large negative effect on resulting earnings. If anticipated revenues do not materialize as expected, our gross margin and operating results could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe face intense price competition in the EDA industry.\nPrice competition in the EDA industry is intense, which can lead to, among other things, price reductions, longer selling cycles, lower product margins, loss of market share, and additional working capital requirements. If our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products, we may need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully. Any such changes would likely reduce margins and could materially adversely impact our operating results. Any broad-based changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause new license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as the sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle certain software or hardware products with other more desirable products at low prices or no marginal cost for promotional purposes as a long-term pricing strategy, or engage in predatory pricing. These practices could significantly reduce demand for our products or limit our pricing.\nWe currently compete primarily with two large companies: Synopsys, Inc. (Synopsys) and Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (Cadence). We also compete with smaller companies with focused product portfolios and manufacturers of electronic devices and semiconductor equipment that have acquired or internally developed their own EDA products.\nOur hardware emulation products are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, the results of our emulation business may be adversely affected.\nDesigning, developing, and introducing new emulation products is a complicated process. The development process for our emulation products requires a high level of innovation. After the development phase, we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture next generation products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do so in a cost effective manner. Our manufacturing model, in which our emulation products generally are not built until after customer orders have been forecast, may from time to time experience delays in delivering products to customers in a timely manner. These delays could cause our customers to purchase emulation products from our competitors. Customers may also delay purchases of existing products in anticipation of our next generation product releases or those of our competitors. We may be unable to minimize this impact by anticipating and managing the addition of, and transition to, new generations of emulation hardware. Conversely, if we manufacture emulation products in anticipation of future sales which do not timely occur, we may hold excess inventory with associated risks of product obsolescence.\nWe may experience difficulty in manufacturing our emulation hardware.\nWe currently use one manufacturer to assemble our hardware emulation products and purchase some components from a single supplier. We may be exposed to delays in production and delivery of our emulation products due to delays in receiving components or manufacturing constraints; components rejected that do not meet our standards; components with latent defects; low yields of ICs, subassemblies, or printed circuit boards (PCBs); or other delays in the manufacturing process. For single\nsource parts we purchase for our emulation products, there can be no assurance that if a supplier cannot deliver, a second source can be found on a timely basis. Our reliance on sole suppliers may also result in reduced control over product pricing and quality. Natural disasters such as weather or earthquakes may adversely affect the supply of components, sub-assemblies or shipment of final products.\nWe may have to replace emulation components under warranty or under support contracts.\nOur emulation hardware products are complex and despite pre-shipment testing, some defects may only appear after the products are put into use under operating conditions, including longer-term, continuous use at high capacities. As a result, customers may experience failures requiring us to replace components under warranty or as part of our customer support obligations, thus increasing our costs and reducing availability of components for other sales.\nForeign currency fluctuations may have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe typically generate more than half of our revenues from customers outside the United States (U.S.) and we generate approximately 35% of our expenses outside the U.S. While most of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, our international operating expenses are typically denominated in foreign currencies. Significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly in the Japanese yen and the euro, could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses, adversely affect our operating results, and require increased time and attention of our management.\nOur international operations subject us to risks in addition to those we face in our domestic operations, including longer receivable collection periods; issues relating to complying with complex customs regulations and paying customs duties and value added taxes; changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s economic or political conditions; trade protection measures; trade sanctions, such as those imposed on Russia by the U.S. and the European Union; local labor laws; import or export licensing requirements; anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; limitations on repatriation of earnings; and difficulties with licensing and protecting our intellectual property (IP) rights. If we violate laws related to our business, we could be subject to penalties, fines, or other sanctions and could be prohibited or restricted from doing business in one or more countries.\nIntegrated circuit and printed circuit board technology evolves rapidly.\nThe complexity of ICs, PCBs, and electrical systems continues to rapidly increase. In response to this increasing complexity, new design tools and methodologies must be invented or acquired quickly to remain competitive. If we fail to quickly respond to new technological developments, our products could become obsolete or uncompetitive, which could materially adversely impact our business.\nErrors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability.\nOur customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity and have unique specifications. Due to the complexity of the systems and products with which we work, some of our products can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace. As a result, our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software, or the products or systems designed with or manufactured using our software may not operate as expected. Errors or defects could result in:\n\u2022\nLoss of current customers and market share, and loss of or delay in revenue;\n\u2022\nFailure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022\nDiversion of development resources to resolve problems resulting from errors or defects;\n\u2022\nDisputes with customers relating to such errors or defects, which could result in litigation or other concessions; and\n\u2022\nIncreased support or service costs.\nIn addition, we include limited amounts of third-party technology in our products and we rely on those third parties to provide support services to us. Failure of those third parties to provide necessary support services could materially adversely impact our business.\nLong sales cycles and delay in customer completion of projects make the timing of our revenues difficult to predict.\nWe have a long sales cycle. A lengthy customer evaluation and approval process is generally required due to the complexity and expense associated with our products and services. Consequently, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenues and may prevent\nus from pursuing other opportunities. Purchases of our products and services are sometimes discretionary and may be delayed if customers postpone approval or commencement of projects due to budgetary constraints, internal acceptance review procedures, timing of budget cycles, or timing of competitive evaluation processes. Long sales cycles for our hardware products may subject us to risks over which we have limited control, including insufficient, excess, or obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation, and fluctuations in quarterly operating results.\nAny loss of our leadership position in certain categories of the EDA market could harm our business.\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by very strong leadership positions in specific categories of the EDA market. For example, one company may have a large percentage of sales in the physical verification category of the market while another may have a similarly strong position in mixed-signal simulation. These strong leadership positions can be maintained for significant periods of time as the software is difficult to master and customers are disinclined to make changes once their employees, as well as others in the industry, have developed familiarity with a particular software product. For these reasons, much of our profitability arises from niche areas in which we are the leader. Conversely, it is difficult for us to achieve significant profits in niche areas where other companies are the leaders. If for any reason we lose our leadership position in an important niche, our business could be materially adversely impacted.\nConflict minerals regulations may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals (commonly referred to as tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold) in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements if the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. Implementing these requirements could affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of materials used in our hardware products as well as the companies we use to manufacture our products and their components. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict-free metals, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. The costs of complying with these laws could adversely affect our current or future business.\nPre-announcing products may adversely impact current sales.\nWe or our competitors sometimes pre-announce or provide \"road maps\" of the expected availability of new hardware or software products or product features. Such pre-announcements, whether offered by the pre-announcing company or its competitors, can result in customers canceling or deferring orders for currently offered products anticipating that currently offered products may be uncompetitive or lacking in features or performance. We believe the expected release of a competitor's emulation product in 2015 may have resulted in the deferral of orders for our emulation products. In the case of hardware products, slowing sales may cause inventories to increase or become obsolete, resulting in the need to discount or reduce production of current products.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from relatively few product groups.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of relatively few product groups and related support services. As a result, any factor adversely affecting sales of these products, including product release cycles, market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition, and economic and market conditions, could harm our operating results.\nAccounting rules governing revenue recognition are complex and periodically change.\nThe accounting rules governing revenue recognition are complex and are revised periodically. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This rule is based on the principle that the amount of revenue recognized should reflect the consideration an entity expects to receive for goods and services provided to customers. The rule defines a five step process for revenue recognition, making it possible for more judgment and estimation within the revenue recognition process than is required under existing U.S. GAAP. Currently, we will be required to implement this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The standard permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method, nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting. Implementation of this new standard could have a significant effect on our reported financial results.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nSignificant judgments and estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes including the determination of research and development incentives and other credits and other tax liabilities worldwide. Our tax expense may be impacted if our intercompany transactions, which are required to be computed on an arm\u2019s-length basis, are successfully challenged by tax authorities. The application of transfer pricing involves subjectivity, with a variety of application between countries. Transfer pricing disputes are especially common in certain countries, and on specific types of transactions such as business and IP transfers and management fees, and are increasingly resulting in litigation. Additionally, our tax expense could be impacted if a tax authority successfully asserted that we, or one of our subsidiaries, has a taxable presence in a country where a member of our group is not currently filing. Increasingly, tax authorities are asserting that foreign companies have unreported taxable presences, and various authorities are either evaluating or adjusting their laws and practices to lower the threshold for a taxable presence in conjunction with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project.\nOur tax expense could also be impacted by the applicability of withholding taxes on software licenses, services, and related intercompany transactions in certain jurisdictions. In determining the adequacy of income taxes, we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes that could result if our tax positions were challenged by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other local or foreign tax authorities. The tax authorities in many of the countries where we do business regularly examine our income and other tax returns, and the ultimate outcome of these tax audits or other examinations cannot be predicted with certainty.\nIn addition, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. A change in our decision concerning the amount of historical foreign earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested could increase our effective tax rate.\nForecasting our income tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty.\nThe computation of income tax expense (benefit) is complex as it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under U.S. GAAP. Income tax expense (benefit) for interim quarters is based on a forecast of our global tax rate, including a separate determination for entities, if any, with losses for which no tax benefit is obtained. This forecast contains numerous assumptions and includes forward looking financial projections, such as the expectations of profit and loss by jurisdiction. Various items cannot be accurately forecast and future events may be treated as discrete to the period in which they occur. Our income tax rate can be materially impacted, for example, by the geographical mix of our profits and losses; changes in our business, such as internal restructuring and acquisitions; changes in tax laws and accounting guidance, and other regulatory, legislative or judicial developments; tax audit determinations; changes in our tax positions; changes in our intent and capacity to permanently reinvest foreign earnings; changes to our transfer pricing practices; tax deductions attributed to equity compensation; and changes in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. For these reasons, our overall global tax rate may be materially different from our forecast.\nCertain tax policy efforts, including the OECD\u2019s BEPS Project, the European Commission\u2019s state aid investigations, and other initiatives could have a material effect on the taxation of international businesses, particularly companies with global IP and supply chain structures, and companies which publish software. Furthermore, many of the countries where we are subject to taxes, including the U.S., are independently evaluating their tax policy and we may see significant changes in legislation and regulations concerning taxation. Certain countries, such as the United Kingdom with its Diverted Profits Tax, have already enacted legislation which could affect international businesses, and other countries have become more aggressive in their approach to audits and enforcement of their applicable tax laws. Such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies, or practices, could increase our effective tax rates in various countries where we have operations and our overall tax rate could be materially affected, impacting our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nThere are limitations on the effectiveness of controls.\nWe do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud or that our policies and procedures can prevent all violations of the law by our employees, contractors, or agents. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that our control system will detect all errors and instances of fraud, if any, or prevent our employees, contractors, or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating laws and regulations. Failure of our control systems to prevent error and fraud or violations of the law could materially adversely impact us.\nWe are subject to changing corporate governance regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance.\nRules and regulations set out by various governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the U.S. such as the SEC, NASDAQ, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the FASB, as well as in other worldwide locations where we operate, are continually evolving in scope and complexity which makes compliance increasingly difficult and uncertain. The increase in costs to develop awareness and comply with such evolving rules and regulations as well as any risk of noncompliance could adversely impact us.\nWe may not realize revenues as a result of our investments in research and development.\nWe incur substantial expense to develop new products. Research and development activities are often performed over long periods of time. These efforts may not result in successful product offerings because of changes in market conditions, competitive product offerings, advancements in technology or our failure to successfully develop products based on that research and development activity. As a result, we could realize little or no revenues related to our investment in research and development.\nWe may acquire other companies and may not successfully integrate them.\nWe have acquired numerous businesses and are frequently in discussions with potential acquisition candidates, and we may acquire other businesses in the future. While we generally analyze potential transactions before committing to them, we cannot provide assurance that any completed transaction will result in long-term benefits to us or our shareholders or that we will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively. In addition, growth through acquisition involves a number of risks. If any of the following events occurs after we acquire another business, it could materially adversely impact us:\n\u2022\nDifficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit;\n\u2022\nThe substantial diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business when integrating the acquired business;\n\u2022\nThe failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and increases in revenues;\n\u2022\nThe failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nDifficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business in, for example, distribution, engineering, and customer support areas;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated costs;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated liabilities or litigation in connection with or as a result of an acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers, or third parties;\n\u2022\nAdverse impacts on existing relationships with suppliers and customers; and\n\u2022\nFailure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited experience.\nAcquired businesses may not perform as projected, which could result in impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets. Additional challenges include integration of sales channels, training and education of the sales force for new product offerings, integration of product development efforts, integration of systems of internal controls, and integration of information systems. Accordingly, in any acquisition there will be uncertainty as to the achievement and timing of projected synergies, cost savings, and sales levels for acquired products. All of these factors could impair our ability to forecast, meet revenues and earnings targets, and effectively manage our business for long-term growth.\nOur competitors may acquire technology or other companies that impact our business.\nOur competitors may acquire technology or companies offering competing or complementary product offerings which could adversely impact our ability to compete. A competitor may be able to deliver better or broader product offerings, offer better pricing, or otherwise make it more desirable for our customers to buy more of the tools in their design flow after the acquisition. In addition, our competitors may purchase companies or technology that we had an interest in acquiring, which could limit our expansion into certain market segments. Similarly, our competitors may purchase companies or technology on which we have a dependency resulting from our having bundled the acquired software with our products for licensing to customers or our use of the acquired software in our research and development environment.\nCustomer payment defaults could adversely affect our timing of revenue recognition.\nWe use fixed-term license agreements as standard business practices with customers we believe are creditworthy. These multi-year, multi-element term license agreements have payments spread over the license term and are typically about three years in length for semiconductor companies and about four years in length for IC foundries and military and aerospace companies. The complexity of these agreements tends to increase the risk of non-collectibility from customers that can arise for a variety of\nreasons including ability to pay, product dissatisfaction, and disputes. If we are unable to collect under these agreements, our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. We have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms of fixed-term license agreements without making concessions on payments, products, or services. If we no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on the terms of the agreements, U.S. GAAP would require revenue to be recognized as the payments become due and payable over the license term. This change could have a material adverse impact on our near-term results.\nWe may not adequately protect our proprietary rights or we may fail to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses.\nOur success depends, in large part, upon our proprietary technology. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, licenses, and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products. Despite precautions we take to protect our IP, we cannot provide assurance that third parties will not try to challenge, invalidate, or circumvent these protections. The companies in the EDA industry, as well as entities and persons outside the industry, continue to obtain patents at a rapid rate. We cannot predict if any of these patents will cover any of our products. In addition, many of these entities have substantially larger patent portfolios than we have. As a result, we may on occasion be forced to engage in costly patent litigation to protect our rights or defend our customers\u2019 rights. We may also need to settle these claims on terms that are unfavorable; such settlements could result in the payment of significant damages or royalties, or force us to stop selling or redesign one or more products. We cannot provide assurance that the rights granted under our patents will provide us with any competitive advantage, that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications, or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, recent U.S. court decisions have substantially weakened the enforceability of patents for software-related inventions, which make up a large portion of our patent portfolio. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as U.S. law protects these rights in the U.S. In addition, despite the actions we take to limit piracy, other parties regularly illegally copy and use our products, which results in lost revenue.\nSome of our products include software or other IP licensed from third parties, and we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for software and other IP in the future. Failure to obtain software or other IP licenses or rights from third parties on favorable terms could materially adversely impact us.\nAlice court ruling could have a negative effect on the validity of some of our U.S. patents.\nOn June 19, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a significant decision in Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l, in which the Court tightened the standard for patentability of software inventions. The Court stated that if a person has an idea so abstract that it cannot be patented, simply tying it to a \"generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\" The Court further stated that tying the abstract idea to \"purely functional and generic\" hardware would, similarly, not make the idea patentable. Many commentators believe the Alice decision is another in a line of cases intended to limit the validity of poor quality software patents. In any event, the Alice decision will provide accused infringers of software patents new arguments to challenge the validity of such patents. At this time, the effects of the Alice decision are still being assessed by patent holders, attorneys, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and courts. The Alice decision and related U.S. Supreme Court decisions could potentially have a negative effect on the validity of some of our U.S. patents.\nIntellectual property infringement actions may harm our business.\nPatent holders are making increasing efforts to monetize their patent portfolios. IP infringement claims against us directly, or where we contractually must defend our customers, could result in costly litigation and consume significant time of employees and management. In addition, IP litigation could harm our business, due to damage awards, payment of legal fees, an obligation to refund license fees to a customer or forgo receipt of future customer payments, the need to license technology on what might be unfavorable business terms, injunctions that could stop or delay future shipments, or the need to redesign our technology. For example, we are currently engaged in patent infringement litigation in Japan, California, and Oregon involving Emulation and Verification Engineering S.A., EVE-USA, Inc., and Synopsys. Further information regarding these lawsuits is contained in Part I, Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\".\nOur use of open source software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and may subject us to unanticipated obligations.\nThe products, services or technologies we acquire, license, provide or develop may incorporate or use open source software. We monitor and restrict our use of open source software in an effort to avoid unintended consequences, such as reciprocal license grants, patent retaliation clauses, and the requirement to license our products at no cost. Nevertheless, we may be subject to unanticipated obligations regarding our products which incorporate open source software.\nOur failure to attract and retain key employees may harm us.\nWe depend on the efforts and abilities of our senior management, our research and development staff, and a number of other key management, sales, support, technical, and services personnel. Competition for experienced, high-quality personnel is intense, and we cannot provide assurance that we can continue to recruit and retain such personnel. Our failure to hire and retain such personnel could impair our ability to develop new products and manage our business effectively.\nWe have global sales and research and development offices in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the United States.\nWe have global sales and research and development offices, some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the U.S. In particular, approximately 15% of our workforce, and a larger percentage of our engineers, are located in our offices in Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Armenia, and Russia which may be subject to disruption or closure from time to time. As a result, we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of potential unrest, terrorist acts, or military conflicts than businesses located domestically. This could have a material adverse effect on product delivery and our research and development operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of natural disasters.\nWe have sales and research and development offices worldwide which may be adversely affected by weather, earthquakes, or other natural disasters. If a natural disaster occurs at or near any of our offices, our operations may be interrupted, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, if a natural disaster impacts a significant number of our customers, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIf our information technology security measures are breached, our information systems may be perceived as being insecure, which could harm our business and reputation.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information owned by us and our customers. We have sales and research and development offices throughout the world. Our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations worldwide. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to breach by cyber-attacks, errors or malicious actions by employees or contractors, or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations. Breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, adverse publicity, violations of privacy laws, and litigation. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, with the use of \"cloud\" services in our business, despite our attempts to validate the security of such services, proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties. If there is an actual or perceived breach of our security, or the security of one of our vendors, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business, or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers.\nOur revolving credit facility has financial and non-financial covenants, and default of any covenant could materially adversely impact us.\nOur bank revolving credit facility imposes operating restrictions on us in the form of financial and non-financial covenants. Financial covenants include adjusted quick ratio, tangible net worth, leverage ratio, senior leverage ratio, and minimum cash and accounts receivable ratio. If we were to fail to comply with the financial covenants and did not obtain a waiver from our lenders, we would be in default under the revolving credit facility and our lenders could terminate the facility and demand immediate repayment of all outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility. The declaration of an event of default could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We could also find it difficult to obtain other bank lines or credit facilities on comparable terms.\nWe have a substantial level of indebtedness.\nAs of January 31, 2016, we had $291.6 million of outstanding indebtedness, which includes principal of $253.0 million of 4.00% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2031 (4.00% Debentures), $ 5.2 million in other notes payable, and $33.4 million in short-term borrowings. This level of indebtedness among other things could:\n\u2022\nMake it difficult for us to satisfy payment obligations on our debt;\n\u2022\nMake it difficult for us to incur additional indebtedness or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nLimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business;\n\u2022\nReduce funds available for use in our operations;\n\u2022\nMake us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and\n\u2022\nPlace us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources.\nWe may also be unable to borrow funds as a result of an inability of financial institutions to lend due to restrictive lending policies and/or institutional liquidity concerns.\nOur 4.00% Debentures are convertible under certain circumstances at a conversion price as of January 31, 2016 of $20.08 per share (as adjusted for the effect of cash dividends and other applicable items). These circumstances include the market price of our common stock exceeding 120% of the conversion price, or $24.09 per share as of January 31, 2016, for at least 20 of the last 30 trading days of the previous fiscal quarter. If any of the holders elect to convert their debentures, we are required to pay cash for at least the principal amount of any converted debentures and cash or shares for the excess of the value of the converted shares over the principal amount. If holders of a significant amount of our 4.00% Debentures elect to convert, we could have difficulty paying the amount due upon conversion, which would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. However, the market value of the 4.00% Debentures has exceeded and likely will continue to exceed the value that would be received on conversion, and we believe it is unlikely at this time that a significant amount of our 4.00% Debentures would be converted, if conversion were available.\nIf we experience a decline in revenues, we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness. Any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur stock price could become more volatile, and your investment could lose value.\nAll of the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements, or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us or by our competitors of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors\u2019 or analysts\u2019 valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings, and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders.\nResponding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations, and diverting the attention of management and our employees. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nAbility to pay dividends.\nWe currently declare and pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, earnings, available cash, cash flow, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Our revolving credit facility contains certain financial and other covenants, including a limit on the aggregate amount we can pay for dividends and repurchases of our stock over the term of the facility of $200 million plus 70% of our cumulative net income for periods ending after February 1, 2016. In addition, our board may decrease or discontinue payment of dividends at any time, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 52813, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "MENT"}
